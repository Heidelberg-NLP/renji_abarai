57	S9f3db814-A362a121f	2	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action should be based on Socio-Economic Status and not race or religion	"Affirmative Action, as a whole, has the potential to be a stepping stone for America to truly become a nation of the people. Throughout history America has technically been a democracy, but the ruling class have always suppressed the greater majority due to power and money. They have either weaseled around or outright broken the constitution. Since the Progressive Era, however, America has evolved into a nation truly of the people, by the people, and for the people (not the elitist class). There is one flaw in Affirmative Action however: it is based on race. Affirmative Action currently is more interested in integrating women and minorities (who undeniably generally have a lower socio economic background in general) with white male Protestants/Catholics. This does not make sense. Firstly, a number of these groups are proved to not have a disadvantage within society. for example, there are currently more women enrolled in colleges than men (http://www.usatoday.com...) . I admit that racial minorities in general struggle more due to a past of intense persecution and white protestants/Catholics often were more successful due to a society in their favor. However, there are currently minorities with significant advantages due to their lineage and whites tragically disadvantaged due to a history of persecution. White Trash and Honkies are two terms equally cruel and derogatory to racial black terms such as nigger. Throughout the US during the nineteenth century, illustrations and hand drawings depicted the Irish with the ""ape like image"" of Irish people's faces appeared to be primordial like a monkey's, and claims of evolutionary racism about the origin of Irish people as an ""inferior race"". (http://www.victorianweb.org...) After 1860 many Irish sang songs about signs reading ""HELP WANTED - NO IRISH NEED APPLY""; these signs came to be known as ""NINA signs. (http://tigger.uic.edu...) While the Irish are the race oriented example, there are other, less 'race specific' examples of persecution of white people. Anyone who is poor, including those that are white, are persecuted. There are horrific crimes against the homeless for being homeless. (http://www.cnn.com...) Gerontophobia is the fear of the elderly, causing discrimination against them. . (http://www.ias.ac.in...) Ephebiphodia is a fear of youth, causing discrimination against them. (http://www.spiked-online.com...) It is unnecessary to list every form of of discrimination to understand that Affirmative Action, based on religion, race, and sex (women have already risen from persecution, as already proved). All that discriminate have one ideal in common: elitism. Elitism defined in this debate are the individuals who form an elite in a society. The elite are the elite due to superior intellect, wealth, specialized training or experience, other distinctive attributes, or simply being members of a majority. Being elitist is not inherently a bad thing. However, it is exceptionally common for elitists to feel justified in, misconstrue morality in, or recognize gain in the need to persecute or control a certain people(s) unlike or less fortunate than themselves. While Elitism may or may not be possible to end, there are steps that can weaken it. Current Affirmative Action would most likely do more good than harm. Racial, and occasionally religious, minorities generally have less education, less wealth, less power, and less Elitist qualities than the majority. However, there are those that are elitist that are racial or religious minorities. Forbes listed 20 Black Americans that are elitist (http://gossiboocrew.com...) 139 of the 400 wealthiest Americans are Jewish (http://blogs.jta.org...) Mormons have a higher tendency to be well educated. (http://www.fairlds.org...). Furthermore, ten percent of all White Americans are bellow the poverty line. (http://www.census.gov...) A better alternative to Affirmative Action is to base it not on race or religion, but based on socio-economic status. While all racial and religious minorities have members that are elitist, no one bellow poverty level or close to it is. The poverty stricken white American has far more disabilities then the black son of a billionaire. Furthermore, since racial minorities do have a tendency to be in poverty it would assist members of racial minorities that truly needed it. Please only accept this debate if you believe Affirmative Action must be enacted the way it is. If there is a debate with someone that believes Affirmative Action is entirely bad the debate will be a same song with a different chorus. Again, only accept the debate if you disagree with my argument in the sense you believe Affirmative Action must be enacted the way it currently is. Thank you, and I wish good luck to my opponent."

I saw you comment about trying to swing this an different way. I""m assuming by your post above your trying to say that Affirmative Action does not have preference but rather discourages it. This is an honorable notion but as we all know things that governments want to do don""t always work and can also have the opposite effect of their intended actions. Affirmative Action are one of those programs that do just this. affirmative action noun : the practice of improving the educational and job opportunities of members of groups that have not been treated fairly in the past because of their race, sex, etc. (http://www.merriam-webster.com...) You say that race and gender don't play a role in getting jobs or gaining admission to a school, well if that's so why do they include race and gender sections on applications? If race and gender truly did not matter it wouldn't be included on the application. Here is the government itself making race play a role in jobs as well as scholarships, ""The Obama Administration will make history by hiring the government""s first ""Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity"" to mastermind a multi-million-dollar effort that boosts the number of minorities in biomedical research and slashes discrimination in the federal grant process. The $500 million initiative to racially diversify medical research was launched last year after a government-sanctioned study uncovered a ""disturbing and disheartening"" lack of racial diversity in the field""""""""To right the wrong the NIH created a $500 million plan to support minority students with scholarships, research experiences and even graduate loan repayment. The agency is also creating a new committee that makes ""diversity a core consideration of NIH governance"" and ensures fairness in the peer review system that erases ""unconscious bias related to disparities in research awards."" The plan also implements ""implicit bias and diversity awareness training."". (http://www.judicialwatch.org...) Then we have the Dodd-Frank bill which was passed to stop a financial crises but it also did this ""Key agencies such as the Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Federal Housing Finance Agency, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks will get their own Office of Minority and Women Inclusion. So will the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the National Credit Union Administration. Each office will be equipped with a director and staff to develop policies that promote equal employment opportunities and racial, ethnic and gender diversity of the individual agency as well as companies that do business with it. The goal is to assure ""to the maximum extent possible the fair inclusion"" of women and minorities, individually and through business they own, in the activities of the agencies, including contracting."" I don't know but to me this seems like the federal government is definitely stressing race and gender. Here is just a another instance of city obviously doing what's right. ""You can't make this stuff up. It's a real-life story out of Phoenix, the capitol of Arizona and the nation's sixth-largest city. It has more than 1.4 million residents and, among its official motto's is ""value and respect"" of diversity. This means ""more than gender and race,"" according to the city""s official website. It also encompasses ""uniqueness and individuality"" and embracing differences. ""We put this belief into action to provide effective services to our diverse community."" Evidently officials are willing to compromise those ""effective services"" at 29 public swimming pools spread throughout the city. To diversify the lifeguard force, Phoenix will spend thousands of dollars to recruit minorities even if they""re not strong swimmers, according to an official quoted in a news report. Blacks, Latinos and Asians who may not necessarily qualify can still get hired, says the city official who adds that ""we will work with you in your swimming abilities."" (http://www.judicialwatch.org...) Then of course we have the University of Michigan court case where the school gave an extra 20 points on its admission scoring process to students if they were just minorities. Race and gender play a huge role in Affirmative Action and quite frankly if things would like to be made fair for all it should just be gotten rid of."

57	Safbe98b8-Ad11023c	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action is Justifiable and Constitutional	"Before I begin my argument I would also like to thank my opponent for being civil in their conduct and for being willing to engage in this discourse. Alright I think it""s necessary to outline a few things to recenter the argument a bit and the readress the issues we""ve already discussed. Firstly, a clear definition of what Affirmative Action is: A government (or private) program designed to redress historic injustices against specific groups by making special efforts to provide members of these groups with access to educational and employment opportunities. It was used to promote actions that achieved non-discrimination by preventing employers from discriminating against members of disadvantaged groups. It was intended to promote the opportunities of defined minority groups within a society to given access to that of the majority population. The stated justification for affirmative action by its proponents is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ""ruling class"" of a culture. Quotas are illegal in the United States, where no employer, university, or other entity may create a set number required for each race. [1] So firstly your claim that ""Affirmative Action ""aids"" by imposing quotas based on race and when the standards of that quota are not met, unnecessarily lowering the standards for some, not all, races or sexes"" is false. Quotas were made illegal by the Supreme Court in Regents of the University of California V. Bakke in 1973. This also makes claims about the lowering of standards also false because the need to do so would only arise from trying to fill a quota, which is an illegal and incorrect practice of affirmative action. So my argument is still very much about Affirmative Action. Riding that point, I""d like to point out that there is almost always a disparity between the law and it""s execution. This is true regarding Affirmative Action and even regarding the legislation that the con has cited regarding discrimination. Again, I""d like to give the example of the Civil Rights Act whose effects were not made completely evident until the end of the 20th century and debatably still occurring in an effort to equalize America""s social climate (this is mainly what our debate has been about.) The Con has made the claim that both the 14th and 19th amendment contradict the premises upon which Affirmative Action is predicated. Could you please give further explanation? The absence of more constitutionally-based points in my argument is a result of the principle of strict scrutiny as applied in the majority of Affirmative Action cases. Strict scrutiny is a mediating standard that ties the constitutionality of any governmental or private practice weighing it against the government""s interest. This is made clear in Fisher v University of Texas. This also means that there is going to be a clash of ideologies given an originalist and activist interpretation of the Constitution. So, given the observance of strict scrutiny, in our current social climate, Affirmative Action has already been ruled as constitutional. So what we""re really debating on is whether or not it is still justifiable which would render strict scrutiny inert under the assumption that the needs of the groups that warranted and made Affirmative Action necessary and constitutional in the first place had already been met. However, that conversation is impossible to have without at least making skin, race, and/or biological sex a factor in the argument and by extension a basis. The con has made a clear and correct distinction between racial identity and culture. However, in the case of African Americans the two are nearly inseparable. That is not to say that they are one in the same, however a large part of anyone""s identity is rooted in culture. My claim is that historically, African American identity has always been and continues to be tied to the culture as a result of many factors. Blacks original identity on the North American continent was inseparably tied to slave culture. In the wake of segregation and the social impacts of that, it was still evident that the cultures of the black minority and the white majority were separate based on physical features namely race, skin color, and ethnicity. This trend in political inserts that have propagated cultural divisions based on race is easily observable. Now, policy and society at large function to serve to benefit the majority, it""s a natural consequence of established hierarchies and generally speaking do not necessarily playing to a racist narrative. However the claims I am making are that the hierarchal structures of America specifically were originally founded on racist ideologies given legislative processes, their constituents, and are made evident in our arc of history. These have prevailed and flourished for centuries and their endings are only now being seen at the turn between the 20th and 21st centuries. Now the question is whether or not racism still exists. Racism is defined as prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one""s own race is superior. Prejudice is defined as preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience. ""Disdain"" is but a narrow window to define racism, as the belief, even if subconscious, that one is superior does not always correlate with negative feelings such as disdain and aversion to what is deemed as inferior. I""d like to briefly point out the the subject of race in this instance isn""t an attempt to off-road our debate, but rather it is paramount to understanding the context and the subject matter of Affirmative Action. So we previously equated the existence of racism to the existence of ""unfavorable conditions"" and in my view being in a minority group is already an unfavorable condition, because simply put the needs of the majority across history and geography have outweighed the needs of the minority""s per the pattern of the establishment of hierarchical structures. America is one of the few countries that seeks to rectify that through legislation and as a fundamental principle of its existence, but that has only occurred because the defining lines for what separates the majority from the minority were established from its beginnings and it was determined to be race. So I""d like to preface further comments with the fact that the racial and social climate for all minority groups is better than it has ever been in the history of mankind and continues to get better with each passing year. Equality of opportunity is becoming more of a reality and certainly is the reality for many, even within those minority groups including myself. However, as specified earlier, the natural tendency of a group, community, or nation is to establish laws that benefit the majority, and America is the first of its kind to go against that norm by attempting to expand the area of effect to which freedoms and equality of opportunity reach all people, but in order to do that, given the historical context that precluded that revelation, it has been seen as a necessary countermeasure by the Government (per its own rulings) and by those these programs effect to not only legislate programs that aid under-privileged groups in recognition of an advantaged majority, simply given their status as the majority, but to now tailor that aid to benefit the majority of the minority. Clearly there are exceptions to the predominant culture, and that is clear evidence of progress, but I believe Affirmative Action is a compromise that still requires the effort of underprivileged groups. In summary. Affirmative Action has already been ruled to be constitutional, which constitutionality is justified by the standard of strict scrutiny that grants constitutionality based on the needs of the people translated to the interests of the government."

57	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind.

57	S3ed53d2-Ab1b1bfbe	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	On balance, affirmative action in the United States is desirable	"Con’s shamble of a case consists of four claims: (a) affirmative action costs the government and businesses billions of dollars, (b) affirmative action harms minorities, (c) affirmative action causes racial tension, and (d) affirmative action is sexist. Each argument fails for the same reason: it’s bull all the way down.(a) Economic CostsCon exaggerates the economic costs and ignores the economic benefits. Her source says $1.7 billion is spent on workplace regulations, not affirmative action regulations, and $21.4 billion is spent complying with those workplace regulations. To be sure, these regulations cover affirmative action in the workplace, but it’s a tiny fraction of the total costs. These regulatory/compliance costs are also non-unique, as there’s going to be regulatory/compliance costs whether affirmative action is pursued or not.The $236 billion “opportunity cost” (Con’s word) is also bull. Con’s source says it’s the result of “bad hiring decisions” and “negative effects on morale,” not ""increased drop-outs."" But the notion that for-profit businesses actively sacrifice $236 billion dollars per year because of affirmative action is downright absurd. After all, there’s a reason that every leading business in America supports affirmative action, and it’s because the economic benefits of affirmative action hiring significantly outweigh whatever risks it entails. Con simply fails to take into account the benefits of diversity (see R2). Con’s source is also egregiously outdated (it’s from 1991, when affirmative action looked nothing like today), offers no data to support any of its assumptions/estimates, and even if it had, there’s no way to quantify, with even a modicum of precision or consistency, the so-called “opportunity cost” of “bad hiring decisions” and “negative effects on morale.”(b) Minority HarmsCon suggests four harms to minorities: overpromotion, less black lawyers, more self-doubt, stress, and anxiety among minorities, and discrimination again Asians. I’ll address each in turn.Overpromotion. Con’s argument suffers from what philosopher Michael Sandel calls “the smug assumption … that success is the crown of virtue.” [8] The truth is we learn more from our failures than our successes. There’s value in reaching for something beyond ourselves, in stretching ourselves past our present capacities. As T.S. Eliot wrote: “Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.” Or as Thomas Edison famously quipped: “I make more mistakes than anyone I know. And eventually I patent them.” So even if some minorities struggle more at higher-tier schools, they also undoubtedly learn and grow more through that struggle.Professor Ian Ayres confirms this point, noting that “most overmatched students” are “carried along to more success.” This happens, in part, because overmatched students “may be mentored and inspired by their better-credentialed peers or teachers, or obtain the advantage of greater institutional commitment of resources.” [9] Similarly, Professor David Wilkins observes that students at higher-tier schools are “granted a lifetime membership in the elite networks to which the graduates of such institutions automatically belong,” as well as “a visible and durable credential that they can use to signal to employers that they have received all of the valuable goods that elite schools provide.” [10]Unsurprisingly, then, most minorities choose to attend higher-tier schools despite having below average SAT or LSAT scores, because they recognize the immense benefit of attending a higher-tier school. They also recognize that their lower test scores are often the result of circumstances beyond their control: lack of caring parents, attentive teachers, a decent neighborhood, or test-prep courses. As Derek Bok explains, “black matriculants are … in the best position to weigh the pros and cons. The data are universal. Black students do not seem to think they have been harmed as a result of attending selective colleges with race-sensitive policies.” [11] And to the extent someone thinks they’re worse off at a better school, they’re free to attend (or transfer to) a lower-tier school. Affirmative action doesn’t force anyone to attend higher-tier schools; it simply provides the opportunity.Less black lawyers. [12] Con cites Richard Sander’s discredited analysis of affirmative action in the context of law schools. Recent studies reveal that Sander made several false assumptions and exaggerated the “mismatch” effects in law schools. When interpreted correctly, the data shows that affirmative action “is pivotal in achieving racial diversity in law schools, and that any mismatch effects are concentrated among students who would not be admitted to any law school without preferences.” In the absence of affirmative action, “all but the least selective schools would enroll one-third to one-half fewer black students than they do today.” As a result, “many potentially successful black law students would be excluded, far more than the number who would be induced to pass the bar exam by the elimination of mismatch effects.” [13] Affirmative action thus leads to significantly more (and better trained) black lawyers.Con also mistakes the baseline goal of affirmative action. It’s not to create as many black lawyers/professionals as possible, it’s to advance society and the black community as a whole. That goal is furthered by an admissions process that gets the largest number of blacks into top-tier schools, where they have a better chance of going on to become partners at major firms or to serve in the upper echelons of government. Moreover, it’s better for the black community to promote diversity, to facilitate transracial learning, and to instill a sense of multiracial solidarity, at all schools, not just lower-tier schools. So even assuming arguendo that affirmative action somehow decreases the number of black professionals, the benefits of affirmative action still outweigh that harm twice over.Self-doubt. There’s no evidence that affirmative action causes stress, anxiety, or self-doubt. Con hasn’t even show there’s a correlation here, much less an actual causal chain. For instance, Con’s [4] doesn’t offer a single piece of reliable evidence – it’s just an “opinion” piece with no supporting data or citations whatsoever. Even worse, Con’s [14] shows that minorities in high school, not college, experience greater stress, anxiety, and self-doubt. That alone disproves any notion that affirmative action is causing these problems. And to the extent there’s something causing self-doubt among minorities, a better explanation is that it’s the institutional racism that minorities face on a day-to-day basis. Affirmative action helps solve that problem (see R2).Asians. Con ignores the variability of the Asian American community, which includes many poorer subgroups (e.g. persons of Laotian, Cambodian, and Hmong ancestry). If you look at the data underlying Con’s source (from Espenshade’s study), it shows that upper-class Asian students don’t benefit from affirmative action admissions, but underrepresented Asian ethnicities that come from lower-income families actually have a higher probability of being accepted compared with students of other races. This shows that current affirmative action policies actually benefit underrepresented Asian students raised in lower-income homes. [14](c) Racial TensionThere's no evidence that affirmative action has any causal relationship with racial tension or racial violence. True, some white candidates (and maybe some Asian candidates) ""feel"" mistreated by affirmative action programs. But this ""perception"" rests on a misunderstanding of affirmative action and university admissions, and it's a minor social cost compared with the benefits of affirmative action.First, the perception of mistreatment is usually wrong. Goodwin Liu has demonstrated that most rejected whites would have been turned down in the absence of affirmative action, and more than half would also have been turned down had they been black. The reason for this is because there are simply so many whites competing for each particular seat in a class. Thus, Liu found that “the admission of minority applicants and the rejection of white applicants are largely independent events."" [15] Second, affirmative action isn't a form of invidious racial discrimination. It doesn't send a message that whites are an inferior race. Rather, it's a collective effort to address a major social problem (see R2 on reparatory justice). There's nothing wrong or unfair about enlisting the help of all Americans in addressing that problem.Third, universities dont exist to reward ""merit,"" independently defined. Admission is only justified insofar as it contributes to the social purpose the university serves, and that purpose may legitimately include racial rectification.So to the extent some whites feel mistreated by affirmative action, they're wrong. At most, thiat perception is a minor social cost that's completely outweighed by the benefits of affirmative action. Also, Con randomly cites a novel for the claim that homogenous societies are better. But see R2: diverse societes are better on every level. (d) Sexism In the United States, women are free to pursue whatever careers they want. Affirmative action simply creates greater opportunity for them to do that. At bottom, it doesn't encourage/require women to do anything. Con also says something about quotas. But in the United States, quotas are illegal. So quotas are outside the scope of this debate.--Sources:8. Michael Sandel, Justice 9. http://tinyurl.com... 10. http://tinyurl.com... 11. http://tinyurl.com...12.

(Above is not “bull”)As you can see, “bull” and my argument are entirely different entities.Premise: The cost of affirmative-actionThe opponent’s counter-argument is mitigation, so even if you agree with the opponent, my argument still generates negation weight.I will admit that the $1.7 and $21.4 billion costs are only partially accounted for by affirmative-action. My Negation Case generates partial weight from this point.The opponent’s misinterpretation of my source is catastrophic, when he blunders accusing my source of saying that the $236 billion cited is a result of “bad hiring decision” and “negative effects on morale.” Please, control+f the source, and you will not find either. Rather, the source *explicitly* says, “Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer determined […] cost attributed to federal compliance with affirmative action policies [… were] well over $225 billion” [6]. This figure, ultimately, is uncontested.As for lack of data, Brimelow and Spencer published data in their Forbes article [2].As for the data being not recent, does that mean that the opportunity costs today is non-existent? If anything, due to inflation, the costs will be higher. The opponent’s complaint is trivial.The diversity argument is addressed under my Counter-arguments section.Negation ArgumentsArgument in relation to minority affirmative-action recipients (i.e. African-Americans, Hispanics etc.)Link 1: Affirmative-action hurts minoritiesOverpromotionThe opponent begins by wasting everyone’s time with more impact-less quotes.Ayres’ qualitative assessment is destroyed by the facts I presented: minority students, with affirmative-action in place at a law school, had a pass rate of one in four and are over-represented in the bottom 10% of classes [3]. The opponent provides only an appeal to authority.Wilkin’s point is null because whilst these affirmative-action students have greater networking opportunities available, the expense is that someone else (likely Asian) is deprived of these opportunities – someone gains and loses either way.The argument, in conjunction with Bok’s argument, is more qualitative nonsense. Here, it does not matter whether someone “thinks” they are being harmed. Rather, *are* they actually being harmed? The answer, as I showed in my Round 2 arguments under this heading, is yes! Even worse, as the opponent’s data suggests, is that they’re tricked into thinking that attending courses far above their ability is beneficial! Again, more banal quotes for my opposition.Less black lawyersThe opponent’s counter-argument to Sander’s source is beyond ridiculous. The opponent argues that affirmative-action is “pivotal in achieving racial diversity”, and therefore, Sander’s data is “discredited”. Sorry, but “racial diversity” is not an end in itself (hence the contention). What is an end, is the three out of four minority students flunking their law school courses, and over-representing the bottom 10% of classes [3]. Law schools enroll “potentially successful” students (i.e. the one in four who pass, along with the three who do not) *instead* of the students who are far more likely to succeed, which damages the U.S. economy with $236 billion of opportunity costs [6], as well as the emotional harms to the students [14]. Self-doubtMy opponent’s round 1 definition dictates that affirmative-action applies to “education”, hence, my “high-school” sources remain relevant. Ultimately, three out of four blacks will fail their degrees, thanks to affirmative-action policies. Furthermore, the bottom 10% of classes were found to be over-represented by affirmative-action students [3]. I do not think, especially after presentation of my sources, that anyone enjoys failing or doing poorly at school. Therefore, after failing like this, it is no surprise that affirmative-action students experience self-doubt, great stress and anxiety [14]. Remember: affirmative-action hurts the people who it is meant to help, too.AsiansThis point negates itself; the Asians whom apparently benefit are null by virtue of the ones who do not. Remember: someone’s promotion is another’s sacking.Link 2: Affirmative-action hurts high-performing students, and leads to racial violenceThe opponent concedes that both high-performing White and Asian students are negatively affected by affirmative-action. After that, the opponent argues irrelevancies. The fact is that there are Whites and Asians who *feel* discriminated against (for every affirmative-action student, there has to be someone who misses out). Implicit within the opponent agreeing that “the perception of mistreatment is usually wrong”, is the concession that affirmative-action does indeed generate great amounts of racial tension. Add to that the fact that the opponent concedes my graphs demonstrating great, public tension on the issue, and the result is that my argument here generates great weight. Thus, even the opponent agrees that racial tension results from affirmative-action!The novel “randomly” cited is a summary of research conducted on genetic (racial) interest, so the opponent concedes that source. The opponent later concedes via Ad Hominem and bare assertions (e.g. “racist propaganda”) Professor Rushton’s work on racial tension. Therefore, I affirm, as Salter summarizes, that: “As racial tension strikes a community, as it becomes less homogeneous, it becomes less caring, less friendly and less stable, making it a worse place to live in” [16].As my example of the Baltimore Riot shows, racial tension can erupt into racial violence, which gives further weight to my argument [17].Link 3: Affirmative-action encourages women into jobs they have little interest inGender quotas are backed by the U.S. government, whether illegal or not [12]. The opponent does not understand the grave implications of my contention here. Women *already* have the choices available, as there are laws against exclusion. Now, the U.S. government is taking steps to actively exclude men from positions they would otherwise be entitled to, under equal opportunity laws. As expanded upon in my counter-argument to the Ongoing Sexism contention, women are *choosing* not to enter these professions, even when they have every opportunity to. Hence, there is a great cost in terms of opportunity cost and enforcement of affirmative-action (see my Premise) in attempting to persuade women into jobs they are not interested in. The other impact is that the government openly supports the idea of blatant sexism against men!Counter-argumentsCrystallization: Reparatory JusticeThe opponent never verges on affirming that *past* racial wrongs affect black people *today*, so this argument is hollow nonsense. The opponent’s only attempt at affirmation was under the “Ongoing Racism” contention, wherein both examples the opponent gave vanished in later rounds. Otherwise, the opponent never attempts to demonstrate adverse effects present today; the contention is merely a massive bare assertion.Furthermore, should we not focus on the present? How does racially discriminating against non-affirmative-action students (seeing that places are limited, and someone has to miss-out) “rectify” *past* wrongs? Conclusively, this contention is a massive bare assertion and non-sequitur. Crystallization: DiversityThe opponent completely drops my research from Professor J.P. Rushton, of which demonstrates, using methodology and the scientific method, that increases in diversity merely exacerbate these genetic interests, which leads to racial tension/division in the classroom (which is bad within itself, and can lead to violence). Please extend this argument.The opponent’s interpretation of Putnam is inaccurate. Curiously, even if Putnam does not agree with his data, the fact is that his results show serious problems with diversity, and as we know, diversity leads to racial tension and violence. Again, my opponent appeals to authority, rather than what the facts say.Evidently, diversity is weakness, and actually helps me negate this resolution.Crystallization: [Forced] IntegrationThe opponent’s final clarification is circular: “integration increases the legitimacy of our multiracial democracy” – why would we want such a thing in the first place? Is not one of the contentions on diversity? We are debating this contention on diversity, yet the opponent wants to use it as an assumed premise!Crystallization: Ongoing Racism/SexismWhat a cataclysmic embarrassment this was for the opponent! The opponent drops *ALL THREE* of his original evidence, and then whimpers the bare assertion: “we live in a world where racism/sexism still exists.”After the racial ones were displayed for comedic benefit (they never linked to the resolution, regardless), I eviscerated the gender wage-pay so badly that it is now working heavily in my favor. Moreover, due to the gender wage-pay gap *not* existing, men are heavily *and* unfairly discriminated against under sexist affirmative-action. This impact here is enormous: any place where a woman is hired under affirmative-action (elaboration in Link 3) means that a man is sexually discriminated against!The opponent’s final efforts involve Ad Hominem and bare assertions against Professor J.P. Rushton. Hence, extend my arguments from here (the contention: Actual racial distinctions)References[18] Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer, ""The National Extortion Association?""

57	Sa18fac12-Aa0db2d18	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	European Constitutional Monarchies Ought to be Dissolved	"ROUND 3 I would first off like to apologise for the delay for my response. Procrastination for my Biology lab resulted in procrastination for this debate. I am stuck in the everlasting circle of procrastination. Oh well. Anyways, let us return to the debate!ECONOMIC BENIFITS OF A MONARCHYThe major flaw with my opponents argument is that it is not the royal family itself that produces tourism, but the historical attractions that do. Therefore it is plausible to remove the royal family and the monarchy, without damaging the tourism. This was described well by journalist Hamilton Nolan, who was quoted [1]:""The Royal Family does not ""work"" for that money. The Royal Family does not sit inside Buckingham Palace from 9-5 every day, posing for pictures with tourists for $25 a pop. And even if they were, we certainly wouldn't pay them $50 million a year for that"". This quote addresses several issues with the tourism argument. For one, it is not the Royal Family that is working to produce the tourism money. It is mainly the actual landmarks themselves (i.e. Big Ben, Tower of London, British Museum) that produce the money. The other is that the British people pay the royal family $50 million a year for what? To restore the historical landmarks? This can be considered a legitimate argument, however if we are going to look back at Graph A from round one it is shown that only about 1/4 of that tax money actually goes towards the upkeep of castles and such. Instead, the remaining 3/4 of the taxes go towards keeping the royal family in luxury. Nolan also notes that even if the royal family did work in the tourism business they still wouldn't be worth $50 million a year. Generally I do not quote my opponents, however in this scenario I would like to dissect a particular quote from my opponents opening argument. My opponent also is quoted saying: ""Would tourists keep visiting the Palaces, Tower of London and other monarchy-associated sites even if the royal family themselves had been dissolved? The answer to this question is maybe, but nowhere near as many. Having said that, why should the UK take the risk anyway, as we have proved that the Royal Family more than make up for themselves economically!"" There are several flaws with this claim. For one, how can my opponent possibly know that less tourists will be drawn to the tourist destination if there is no longer a royal family? In my mind, the connection between a tourist destination and the royal family is nearly nonexistent and therefore will hardly affect the tourist industry. For example, if, hypothetically of course, Peru changed its government to a communist system as opposed to a republic, would people stop visiting Machu Pichu? Absolutely not. Therefore I would like to conclude that the UK can gain more money by abollishing the royal family because they would get all of the tax money designated to the queen while the tourism industry would hardly suffer at all. However, it is important to note that this debate is not solely about the British royal family, as it is also about the rest of Europe's monarchies. To get an accurate sense of the effect of royal families on tourism, let us look at the top ten countries in the world in money generated from tourism in graph C. (appologies for the overly large graph) Graph C If we look at these countries, only two of them currently has an active monarch, which is the UK and Australia. For Australia, however, the connection between the monarch and the tourism industry is completely nonexistent given that the queen is never even in Australia anyways. This shows that having a monarch does not necessarily mean that your country will have a brilliant tourism industry. To further support this, in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report in 2013 only four countries with monarchies listed in the top 30 [2]. Therefore it can be concluded that it will not harm the majority of countries with monarchies tourism industry hardly at all if the monarchy is abolished. Now on to the rebuttal about my graph from the first round. I acknowledge the argument about Luxembourg and agree with my opponent full heatedly, and therefore will not rebut his points. However, the comparison between Spain and Germany is a separate situation entirely. My opponent claims that the monarchies have no impact on taxes due to the fact that Spain's per capita cost is lower than that of the non-monarchical Germany. The error with this claim is that the Spanish government has been maniacally cutting taxes so that they can halt their economic down spiral and bring the country back on track [3]. Had Spain had a normal economy (or whatever is normal for Europe) I predict that the per capita cost would be higher than that of Germany's in order to compensate for the unnecessary monarchy.ROLE IN SOCIETYMy opponent claims that my analogy with the monarchy and the dying dog is irrelevant due to the fact that the monarchy is not actually harming the UK in any way. I have rebutted this claim successfully and therefore must conclude that we must be killing some dogs during this section of the rebuttals (sadly). The monarchy in the UK is costing them an additional $50 million for largely unnecessary things such as travel, paying servants, etc. This is similar to the dog analogy as it is costing the owner large amounts of money to simply keep their pet alive, despite its impracticality. My opponents next point about foreign affairs is equally flawed. While it is true that the Queen may speak with foreign countries without political consequence, it is unlikely that she will actually get anything done due to the fact that she has absolutely zero political influence. Thus the proposition is highly illogical. I will acknowledge that the royal family can do some good, through the work of charity and what not. However, I would like to ask my opponent if they could not do so without getting the lofty titles of Queen, or Prince, or Duke, etc. Essentially, my point is that since the royal family has an ungodly sum of money, and not to mention fame, they would easily be able to continue their charity work without still having any technical political role.And finally, onto the satisfaction ratings. The reason why monarchs are inevitably going to have higher satisfaction ratings is because they themselves never do anything or make any decisions that affect the people. Therefore the comparison to Obama is illogical because he actually represents the American people while Elizabeth and Harald simply look pretty (or as pretty as they can be) on their thrones. CONCLUSIONIn this debate I have shown that monarchies overall are expensive and do not pay for themselves through the tourism industry. Due to their expense and their complete lack of political power I would like to conclude that their role in ""power"" is unnecessary and therefore should end. On a side note, I would like to thank my opponent for a fun and intellectual debate. SOURCES[1] http://www.theatlantic.com...[2] http://www3.weforum.org...[3] http://www.ft.com..."

57	Sa2ec2897-Aeccf8d4e	1	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action (Specifically, Standardized Testing)	There's a fundamental problem with the framing of your debate; you claim that the debate is only to be about standardized testing – but you go into several other types of affirmative action (like college admissions processes). In order to properly respond to your argument, one would have to go into those other areas that you've delved into – so hopefully you won't hold it against me when I do. I would first ask that you provide evidence that the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) gives points-based bonuses (or detractions) to people based on their racial affiliation, because I can find absolutely no evidence that this is the case. Such a claim strikes me as patently false for two reasons. First, identifying one's race on the SATs is optional so it is impossible to determine the race of the people taking the test (the question is also posed on the honor system, so if a white applicant wanted to apply for these alleged bonuses on the SATs, all they need do is fill in their race as African American). Second, points-based affirmative action programs are unconstitutional per Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) so this system you're alleging of plus points for black applicants and minus points for Asian applicants would be unconstitutional. What I think you may be referring to is admissions processes and criteria at universities (which use SAT scores among many other variables to determine access into popular programs that have restrictions on how many applicants they will admit). If this is incorrect, please feel free to clarify. As to the general argument against affirmative action that you're making – you fundamentally misunderstand how affirmative action works. The premise of Affirmative Action is that, all things being equal, public institutions should attempt to foster a diverse environment. That's it. There are no quotas, no points systems and minorities are not automatically given preference over whites. If an institution already has a diverse environment that reflects the general demographic characteristics of society, it is under no obligation to give anyone preference based on race or sex. Universities also weight a variety of other categories as well that no one seems to have an objection to, such as geographic region (Michigan universities, for example, give preference to residents of Michigan). Affirmative Action applies to ALL races and sexes; not just minorities and women. If whites or males are underrepresented in various academic programs (as they are in Early Childhood Education and Nursing) – affirmative action applies to them in those cases so they may be given slightly more consideration into those programs. I disagree fundamentally with your claim that Affirmative Action is racist. I would contend, conversely, that it is anti-racist. What is racist (a fact borne out by the myriad statistical quality of life indicators that attest to the lingering racial biases that exist in our society) is not using a program like Affirmative Action to take the implicit racial biases that exist in our society into account because it perpetuates those existing racial biases.

Binding quotas are more effective than most of the other tools, particularly voluntary quotas. Member states, however, could implement any other policy instrument they find suitable alongside the quotas. Yet, binding gender quotas bring quicker results especially in the short run. According to the a report on gender quotas published by the European Department, they are the most successful mechanism to narrow the gender gap in corporate boards and achieve the economic targets by giving the progress on women’s participation on boards. Once targets are reached, policy instruments of positive discrimination will be abolished; therefore, gender quotas are the optimal solution due to their quick effects as in the case of Norway.[1] [1] European Parliament, “Gender Quotas in Management Boards”, 2012	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sc69eced2-A164b4b86	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action	"Con contradicts himself. Con’s section 1. Half Truth’s. Con states, “The point of the debate is, should affirmative action programs be legal? And if not, why not?” If that was truly the “Point” of the debate, then he wouldn’t have posted his “what if scenario” arguments during R2. Obviously he learned something from the information that I documented in my R2, so now in R3 he wants to pretend that this debate is about, “should affirmative action be legal.” Maybe we can have that debate on another occasion, but the resolution of this debate simply says, “Affirmative Action.” He is con and I am pro. He is attempting to make the resolution what he wishes it would have been, had he known the information that I provided. Con’s section 2. Corporate Programs In R2 he states that private enterprise ought to determine the need for affirmative action, and then in R3, he attempts to link the citing of how the fourteenth amendment was used in a court decision involving College admissions to imply that affirmative action is unconstitutional in hiring and promotional practices by private enterprise. No such decision by any court has ever been made involving affirmative action and employment. Here is a quote of him to show that he viewed voluntary AA favorably until I refuted him in R2: “Because if I have a competitor who manufactures the same product, and he doesn't care what sex his workers are, as long as they're good at their job, then he has an advantage over me. The reason is because my competitor has access to a greater supply of quality workers than I do, and I have limited myself to only a certain portion of the labor market.” Then in round 3 he then attempts to link private enterprise’s attempts at finding qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds, with a violation of the 14th amendment. When a private enterprise seeks to diversify its workforce, it does so by marketing to the types of applicants for which it hopes to recruit potential employees. Is con trying to imply that we need government intervention in how employers decide how to market to get applicants to know about job openings? “Affirmative action in employment involves active recruitment of women and minorities by looking for candidates beyond informal job networks traditionally dominated by white men.Affirmative action encourages the public advertisement of jobs to identify qualified candidates in places where employers might not otherwise look.” https://oied.ncsu.edu... Recruiting qualified applicants is much different than discriminating against applicants based solely on external factors. Con quotes: ”The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. It is also illegal to discriminate against a person because the person complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.” but what he fails to realize is that affirmative action in private employment is aimed at finding qualified candidates, not hiring unqualified candidates over qualified white males."" In Richmond Times Dispatch online, Karen Michael discusses how and why the court rulings against affirmative action in College admissions, fails to apply to affirmative action in employment. “Whether you are a federal contractor or not, affirmative action does not mean preferences or quotas. Period. The obligation of federal contractors who have affirmative action obligations simply means that they must track applicants, engage in nondiscrimination, analyze the racial and gender make-up of the organization, and, importantly, cast the net to find qualified minorities and females for consideration in the application process.However, at no point, ever, is the employer permitted to use race or gender as a deciding factor in hiring an employee and must consistently hire the most qualified candidate. To hire a less-qualified person due to race or gender would violate the other federal discrimination laws. For example, it would be illegal to discriminate against a more qualified white male in favor of a less qualified Hispanic female. If an employer did this, the white male could sue alleging discrimination… and he’d win if it was true that the employer made the decision to hire the lesser qualified Hispanic female due to her race or gender. Such discriminatory motive is a textbook violation of Title VII.Federal law is clear that even federal contractors who have affirmative action obligations cannot use illegal considerations in their hiring and promotions practices. The law states as follows as it relates to determining how to attempt to diversify the workplace:” She then quotes the law itself. http://www.richmond.com... In con’s section 2. Corporate Programs he also states, “Because under the definition of affirmative action, as set forth in the debate, an employer would encourage increased hiring of women and minority groups, when the laws that the EEOC is required to uphold do not allow this.” First of all that quote is a dependant clause, a fragmented sentence, as it does not make sense on it’s own, but aside from that, the point he was trying to make is misleading. “An employer would encourage..…..,” is an idea that there is no law against! For an employer to practice the encouragement of hiring individuals, who are not of the race or gender of the most common type of applicants is not illegal. It is illegal to discriminate, it is not illegal to encourage. Con’s section 3. Economic Incentives In R2, con argues that affirmative action discriminates against white males. There are several government grants that are available to any company who bids on them (at which time they only need to have a written plan for hiring more than just white males.) It isn’t unreasonable, in a country where white males have had a social and economic advantage throughout its history, for the government to encourage conditions that lead to prosperity for others, some who have needed to depend on government assistance to survive. The government recognizes the value of being economically independent, so affirmative action is about equal oppurtunity, not the oppression of white males. Conclusion Affirmative action is a way of providing equal opportunity for all andis legal. I have relayed the facts about how and why affirmative action is applied to employment situations in the US. Con has attempted to make the programs that include the idea of affirmative action about the oppression of white males, which he has not proven."

57	Sbe4c5eb9-Aa0d3f0a1	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	We should sacrifice the freedom of the individual to pursue equality.	"When I say perfect equality I mean that of opportunity. The title refers to PURSUING this goal. Furthermore, if we can achieve equality of opportunity which I'm sure you agree we don't have at the moment then that should actually bring us very close to parity of outcome as people will all have the equal ability to pursue success. I argue throughout that limiting freedom in order to reach this point is reasonable and achievable. For the likes of disabled people I am even in favour of bringing in quotas for them in the workplace to make sure that their disability doesn't affect their outcome. For me this is a reasonable sacrifice of the freedom of company bosses and makes sense for society. I also do think equality of outcome is desirable however in my definition I made clear before the debate started that I believed we should sacrifice liberty to an extent which is reasonable and justifiable in order to get as close to this as possible. This of course does not mean going on a Maoist rampage and murdering every rich person to make us all equally poor. Talking about China I did read your attached article. The IMF is mixed in its conclusions. It gets a lot of things wrong (Brexit etc.) Anyway, as you admitted yourself: ""you can't devise a fair test on countries because you can't practically simulate large economies. If you could economics would be more like physics than sociology in the accuracy of it's predictions."" so IT IS wrong to make conclusions about economic policy in ALL cases like some kind of ""general theorem"". Regarding China, its starting position was terrible. It suffered famines and existential tariffs over nukes and Tibet etc. furthermore the west saw industrial collapse which transferred a lot of the market to China. China also has remained a largely socialist economy so equally this is to blame for the negatives as well as the economic growth. In conclusion my side has won this debate because I've shown that individuals' freedom is not only monopolised by the few that are actually able to have it but also that it is not limitless. We have caps on freedom. Fundamentally, the role of government is to allow everyone to live in a just and fair society so they can achieve their best. Considering this denying them parity with the privileged in order to preserve the injustice and power monopoly of a few is immoral. Equality of opportunity under a more socialist system is workable. It may not be perfect but it can work and in the cases it has failed this has equally been to do with western interference and deliberate attack upon that system e.g. the Cold war. Humans are born equally (although obviously different) and therefore equality of opportunity is a right. Given this equality of outcome is the next achievable goal which we should come close to anyway. The status quo gives rights to some and denies it to others limiting others freedoms and upholding a global oppression which has led to injustice and suffering for many. Vote YES."

The minority is not a single person."" However . . . my fair judges, my opponent is STILL saying exactly what I accused him of saying. Indeed as the minority is not limited to multiple people. Minority merely means the individual or individuals whose characteristics in question are the least common amongst the group. To support my claim, I offer you with the following definition from the oxford dictionary: ""minority • noun (pl. minorities) 1 the smaller number or part; a number or part representing less than half of the whole. 2 a relatively small group of people differing from the majority in race, religion, language, etc. 3 the state or period of being a minor."" The first definition makes it clear that anything representing less than half is considered the minority. Given that one person is less than half, 1 would most certainly be considered the minority. Unfortunately, I'm running low on time, so I'll just leave you with this cited wiki article indicating other cases of affirmative action legal disputes as well as how controversies have centered around it positing discrimination (to pacify PRO of course): http://en.wikipedia.org... For a quick recap, my opponent's case is contradictory. At one moment, he is arguing that we should help the minority by giving it a boost. However, when I provide an example of what he perceives as the minority betting kicked down, my opponent merely responds by saying the majority is more opponent. In short, he kicks his own case in the groin. RE:"" When a case of unfairness occurs, the Supreme Court will settle it "" If the Supreme Court is to truly settle unfairness, affirmative action must be rejected. Otherwise, as I've shown, it creates unfairness. Even if you look beyond my example of an individual with superior qualifications losing to a minority who is hardly qualified, the fact of the matter is that judging individuals based on their own race is still inherently unfair (as I've pointed out previously) as the color of own's skin or gender is matter which one most has little to no control over. ============================================================================ CONTENTION #2.

PRO misunderstands me. I'm saying that the predicaments of most African Americans and minorities is brought about through racial prejudice (which is where many stereotypes sprout out at). As we speak, racial prejudice is being spouted due to the unfairness which individuals feel minorities are the cause of. Whereas minorities are getting handouts, other individuals are required to work much harder merely based on their own skin color. It's very much similar to the individuals who hate illegal immigrants due to them getting many jobs. If this sense of unfairness were removed, there would be no racial tensions in the first place, hence removing minorities from the predicament which PRO speaks of. RE: ""And as for my opponent's second paragraph in that contention, a lot of blacks are intelligent, they just haven't been given the opportunity to succeed, college is that opportunity."" Odd. Earlier, PRO was advocating that it was rare to find and intelligent black individual yet is now urging that lots of African Americans are intelligent. Even ignoring the subtle change in his position, it still fails to overcome my argument which eliminates racial tension. If my system is enforced, these intelligent black individuals can use their intelligence to succeed academically rather than rely on handouts and contribute to racial tension. VOTE CON.

Women in Combat Arms (2)	"Thank you Con. == Rebuttal == Notice that almost all of Con's points contain qualifiers such as ""generally,"" ""most,"" ""traditionally,"" and ""average."" Such language renders Con's argument irrelevant, because I am not talking about the average, general population of women. I am talking about above average - the women with exceptional strength and toughness, as I made very clear in Round 2. So, let's go through Con's argument line by line: 1) ""Men are generally physically superior to women..."" - I agree. But I'm not talking about general trends. I'm talking about exceptional individuals who prove they can exceed the standard. When soldiers are measured on individual merit, it's undeniable that some females will prove physically superior to some males. To believe otherwise would be extremely naive. 2) ""Most males are overwhelming[ly] stronger than their female counterparts"" - Again, I agree. This does not hurt my argument. See above. 3) ""Elite female athletes are barely stronger than your average males"" - EXACTLY! So why shouldn't that elite female be allowed to join the ranks of fighting men? If there is at least one single ""average"" male currently serving in the infantry, why shouldn't an elite female also be allowed to serve? Being barely stronger is still stronger, so wouldn't this be an improvement? 4) ""Male bodies are generally less prone to injury..."" Ok, perhaps that is ""generally"" true. But there are always exceptions. There are female athletes out there who are less injury prone than males. What about them? Once again, for Con's argument to work, he would have to show that not a single female in the human species has more endurance, muscle mass, and bone density than a male soldier. That would be an absurd claim. 5) ""Men can't become pregnant. Mixed units can cause distractions."" The concern of pregnancy is at base a concern about physical conditions that can take a soldier out of the fight. It's true, if a female soldier becomes pregnant overseas, she is immediately sent home and can no longer do her job. BUT - this concern applies to every demographic of soldier - male, female, white, black, gay, straight. Only male soldiers can get prostate cancer- should this exclude them? A black soldier might distract a white soldier - should this exclude blacks? A gay infantryman may be sexually attracted to another infantryman - should this exclude him? It's special pleading so say a female should be excluded because of the potential for pregnancy, but all other demographics are acceptable. A better policy is to simply hold individuals accountable for individual choices. If you choose to drink and drive and get a DUI, the army kicks you out. Yes, this hurts unit readiness, especially if that soldier was in a leadership role, but the organization moves on and continues to function just fine. It's ridiculous to think that removing a pregnant female from a unit would destroy unit cohesion and effectiveness. Soldiers are removed from units all the time, and the military continues to do its job. The ""mixed units cause distractions"" argument is extremely weak. Every demographic has the potential to cause ""distraction."" I'm sure black soldiers were a huge distraction to all-white units in the 1950s. Females caused huge distractions at West Point when it became co-ed in the late 1970s. Gay soldiers undoubtedly cause distraction and discomfort to very culturally conservative soldiers. And yet, none of these cases of ""distraction"" were enough to justify continued segregation and exclusion. In fact, the military is undoubtedly stronger because of the diversification of its ranks. The potential for distraction has never been enough to justify discrimination, and it should not be in this case either. 6) ""Men and women are perceived & treated differently"" - I fail to see the relevance here. Every type of person is perceived differently. Officers are treated differently than enlisted soldiers. Marines are perceived differently than sailors. Fighter pilots are perceived differently than supply clerks. This is not a justification for exclusion. If anything, the difference in perception of men and women probably stems from the fact that women aren't allowed to serve in these roles. Once they integrate, that will help change the perception significantly. 7) ""The mililtary has traditinally been an all male endeavor..."" - again, no relevance here. Before 1950, the military was traditionally a racially segregated endeavor. Before 1980, West Point was traditionally an all male endeavor, and before 1877, an all white male endeavor. Before 2011, the US Military was an all heterosexual endeavor, etc.... All these ""traditions"" changed over time and the military was better for it. None of these integrations caused the military to self destruct. This one is no different. Contention #1 - Con claims integrating females will lead to lower standards, citing the infamous ""Dempsey Rule."" My question would simply be - why would standards need to lower if women are already meeting the current ones? To date, 3 women have passed all MALE standards for US Army Ranger School, and more are sure to follow. It seems then, that these tests are not too difficult for women, and so the Dempsey Rule is defunct. Con suggests quotas of women soldiers will develop, but that has so far not been the case. There are no quotas for how many gay, or black, or hispanic soldiers need to be in infantry units. There's no reason to believe there will be quotas for female soldiers either. Con's cited source talks about raw recruitment quotas for females (this is nothing new btw...), but that is not the same as imposing quotas on females specifically in combat arms. To date, zero female marines have passed the Marine Infantry Officer Course, and so there are currently zero female infantry officers. Doesn't appear to be any quota there... Con's argument here is speculative at best. Contention #2 - Don't run social experiments in the military. First, I would counter that it is not a social experiment if you merely say ""here's the standard. It's the same for everyone. If you meet it, you're in. If you don't, you're out."" That's all I'm advoacting. That's not a sinister feminist experiment, it's equality. Second, I once again point to history - black soldiers were first (officially) integrated into white units during the Korean War. Females first graduated West Point in 1980. Gay soldiers first served openly in 2011. All of these could have been considered ""social experiments."" But that didn't stop them from happening, in fact, it only made the military a stronger and more diverse force. Con says society isn't ready for women to fill male roles, wear male style clothing, or share restrooms. Has Con's head been in the sand over the past 10 years? Society is OVERWHELMINGLY advocating for gender equality, unisex restrooms, ending gender norms, etc... Contention #3 - unit cohesion. I have already discussed this. Just because 2/3 of male marines say they disapprove doesn't mean a thing. That's how our system has always worked - the military obeys civilian authority according to the Constitution. Even if the military disagrees, they are legally bound to obey policies and orders issued by civilian leaders (Congress, Secretary of Defense, President, etc...). That's the oath they take. #4 - standards should be raised. Con seems to believe the military is (or should be) filled with super-athlete Arnold Schwartzenegger types. That's not the case. Google search images of combat soldiers from any historical war. What do you see? They mostly look scrawny, thin, unimpressive. You don't have to be an Olympian to be an effective soldier, you have to be smart, and tough. There are certainly smart and tough females out there who can do the job. If the standard is too high, your military will be very small. The bottom line: Some men can't meet current standards. Some women can. Why then is gender the discriminator, rather than the standard itself?"	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

Focus on that definition I provided again for a moment. ""White privilege (or white skin privilege) is a term for societal privileges that benefit white people in western countries beyond what is commonly experienced by the non-white people under the same social, political, or economic circumstances."" The key thing to remember is the bolded part. If a statistical anomaly can be explained by other factors than race such as economic factors than it can't be considered white privilege. ""1) 20% of white people and 10% of black/Latino(a) people use drugs like cocaine, but minorities suffer the vast majority of legal consequences, according to the Huffington Post."" I think my opponent should offer links to articles that can be found online. A problem with tracking down this article is that huffington post literally has hundreds of thousands of articles. We actually don't know the percentage of people who do drugs in any race. The difference in conviction rates for non whites can be explained by a more extensive criminal history. A repeat offender is likely to receive harsher punishments than a first time offender as explained by the following article. ""minorities involved in the urban drug trade are more likely to have more extensive arrest records than suburban dealers and users, which can lead to longer sentences, Olson said."" http://articles.chicagotribune.com... A black person and white person facing a judge with a similar arrest record is likely to have similar results in sentencing. Black people are also more likely to be arrested initially not because of the color of their skin but because they live in a high crime area where drug dealing is more likely to be open and police as a result of crime statistics are also likely to patrol those areas more. From the same article: ""I don't think it's necessarily a policy of the police department to do that. I think it's just an outcome of where they put their resources."" ""The difference in police deployments means minorities involved in the urban drug trade are more likely to have more extensive arrest records than suburban dealers and users, which can lead to longer sentences, Olson said."" ""The divide stems in part from intense police activity in high-crime urban areas, where sales take place in open-air drug markets, making it easier to arrest dealers and buyers, said David Olson, chairman of Loyola University Chicago's criminal justice department."" If you're a white person living in a high crime area, selling your drugs on the street instead of in the privacy of your own home than you're likely to face the same things. By the same token if a black person is living a low crime area and dealing drugs in a discreet manner, he isn't very likely to be targeted by police. This doesn't qualify as white privilege because factors outside of race that would effect whites equally in the same settings are the cause of statistical differences. It would be silly to ask cops to stop patrolling high crime areas as much, to stop arresting people when their crime is extremely obvious and for judges to be softer on repeat offenders. ""it is more common for government to order racial profiling of black people than of whites, and stop and frisk primarily affects minorities as well as police brutality/excessive force. Stop and frisk is more likely to effect blacks because they are more likely to live in high crime areas and other factors exit as well. I really need to see your stats on racial profiling. I see nothing other than a bare assertion to claim that it occurs at a relevant frequency or even at all. Police brutality is likely to be a result of more frequent interactions with police for the reasons previously stated. I'd also like to see some numbers on this. I suspect it's just something that seems to be true due to media coverage cherry picking the stories they use. ""There are no prominent hate groups against white people, there are against minorities. White people set the justice system, laws and governance. Bare assertion and not rue none the less. The black Panthers are a racist organization in my opinion. Plus this leaves out some of the special advantages blacks get such as special scholarship programs, favoritism when applying for a job with equal qualifications to a white (affirmative action, quotas etc.) and many other social programs specifically targeting them. This is a democracy so obviously the largest racial group will have the biggest say in government. To see if there is white privilege, we need to see if these laws are applied evenly across the board in a manner that doesn't consider race, and that's precisely what we see. There are certain groups overly represented in government such as Jewish people but that's a result of them choosing a different path that is more effective at getting them there and not part of any sort of privilege.

57	S9cbc6ad4-A27f95eb4	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Quotas are Inherently Helpful	There are many reasons why quotas aren't as helpful for minority groups as one might think, but it's perhaps best to start with the obvious - quotas aren't something that have been effectively tested in the private sector. Sure, there are businesses that embrace hiring quotas, but that's a part of the corporate culture at that business. There's absolutely no telling how a quota would impact performance across the board in multiple industries and to pretend like it would have overwhelmingly positive results would be disingenuous. Another article from Forbes states that even those who argue that quotas can be helpful have to be mindful of the drawbacks. Quotas can, for example, be an easy way for a business to impose limits rather than for it to embrace diversity. If every business is required to have one woman on the board, what is stopping businesses from simply creating a token board position and then pointing to that position as its sole gesture towards a more diverse workplace? What's to stop the minimum percentage from become the maximum amount of minority representation a business will allow? Minds don't change because they are forced and some people are very good at manipulating the system to make sure that things won't progress. It's not possible to pretend like all quotas are good because that statement is just too broad. Even an admission that a gender quota for boards is good requires several logical leaps. Putting quotas into practice could very well be harmful, yet those in favor want to experiment with the economy in the name of theory.	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sa3cff50e-Accb0dd65	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	There is no clear link between gender quota and economic growth	As Pande and Ford found in their report, countries often adopt gender quotas as a response to changing attitudes to women. However, these countries more often than not are Western advanced economies characterised by efficiency.[1] Therefore, the correlations between gender quotas and good economic performance cannot be attributed entirely to the gender equality measures. Moreover, the competitiveness of the EU economies is damaged by domestic policies and the sovereign debt crisis which will have a larger negative impact on the European economies rather than this measure. Therefore, the expected spillover effects on the economy are unlikely to be realised.[2] Such sceptic views on quotas when accompanied by bad economic factors are shared by international institutions like the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Breaking the glass ceiling may require affirmative action like gender quotas, but if supply-side barriers remain, even such proactive policies will not necessarily lead to the desired result of gender equality and economic advantages.[3] [1] Pande, Rohini & Deanna Ford, “Gender Quotas and Female Leadership: A Review” , Background Paper for the World Development Report on Gender, 2011 [2] ibid [3] Gerecke, Megan, “A policy mix for gender equality?

57	Sa7651994-Ae19eb378	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Sexism is still an issue in modern society.	"Introdution I would like to begin by thanking my opponent for responding. I accept his definition of the word ""issue"" and I will now define another key term. ""Sexism"", in this context, is defined as ""discrimination or devaluation based on a person's sex, as in restricted job opportunities; especially, such discrimination directed against women."" This definition can be found on dictionary.com. Main Argument Contrary to popular belief, females are not the only victims of sexism. For example, divorce laws often favor women over men, stereotyping and assuming that women can care for a child better than a man can. This is not true in every case. According to CBS, ""women still earn an average of 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. For African-American and Hispanic women it's even lower: 64 and 54 cents, respectively."" This cannot be ignored for this is absolutely hideous. Sexism is not only found within the law and the workforce, but it is also a part of daily life. When people say, 'Ladies first', they are stereotyping. They assume that women are weak and unable to wait. In my professional opinion, I believe that whoever is there gets to go first. Sexism is not only reserved for males and females; transgenders are also subject to it.Huffington Post states ""[f]ederal law bans employment discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age and disability. But sexual orientation and gender identity are not on this list, allowing employers to fire workers solely because they are transgender. Rebecca Juro, host of 'The Rebecca Juro Show,' was fired in 1997 immediately after telling her employer that she was in the process of transitioning from male to female."" I urge you to further research this topic yourself and to be aware of the immense discrimination many people face. Given these facts, how can anyone argue that sexism is not an issue? It is a matter of what is morally correct. We have an obligation to ensure that both men and women are granted the same rights and privileges and that we do not favor any gender over another.

57	S621875fb-A46e7236d	1	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Colleges and universities are justified in considering race in admissions decisions.	"Thanks to Pro for his speech. I will begin with rebutting his speech. Issue 1: Does affirmative action uphold the principles of meritocracy? In Pro's case, he argues two things. Firstly, that there are minority races in the status quo who are disadvantaged by the system. Secondly, this disadvantage can be rectified by enabling colleges and universities to ""consider race in admissions decisions"", which essentially means setting an informal quota on how many students of a minority race they would accept. My response to this: 1) There really isn't any evidence coming from Pro showing conclusively that minority races are disadvantaged. Currently, schools are obliged to take in students regardless of race, and they will be prosecuted should they reject any student based on his race. Therefore, schooling opportunities do not suffer from any 'discrimination'. 2) Perhaps Pro's case is the idea that students of a minority race do not have as much resources as students of the majority race, thereby making it unfair. This is incorrect because resource inequality exists even within the students of the majority race, and in fact college admissions do make provisions for people who come from poor backgrounds. Financial assistance also exists for these students who are struggling; needy students who make the cut are given financial bursaries by the government to continue their studies. Hence, even without as much resources, they can still enjoy as much opportunities as their peers. 3) Pro also argued that minority applicants must meet the minimum standard of grades before their race can be considered. If this is true, then we should also consider the situation when there are much more deserving applicants for the school than they can take in. This means that everyone has made the minimum cut, and the selection will then become about choosing the best out of all the deserving applicants. In that case, considering race and thereby prioritising a minority race candidate would rob another candidate of their place in the college. 4) Finally, is this truly the best way to rectify the income inequality between the races? In fact, must we live with stereotyping certain races as ""poor"" or ""rich, when in fact these labels apply equally to all races? The most optimal solution for helping bright students from poor backgrounds to enter universities is to increase spending on all state schools, provide excellent education, and increase financial bursaries and scholarships for talented but needy students. This truly ensures fairness, because those who work hard will be given a helping hand by the government. Therefore, I'm thankful that Pro agrees that meritocracy is important. What we disagree on is whether or not the status quo provides a level playing field for people to compete fairly for opportunities. I've argued that 1) the playing field is rather level already, and 2) there are better ways to level the playing field, such as needs-based financial help. Issue 2: Is affirmative action a fair ""punishment""? Pro's case is essentially the idea that taking from the rich and giving to the poor is charity, and charity is good. My responses: 1) This is an untrue distinction. You are not merely taking away opportunities from the rich, but also from the student who is poor but happens to be of a majority race, and also from the student from an honest middle class family. You are also not merely giving it to the poor, because not all families of a minority race are poor. While it serves as good rhetoric, this isn't true of the sacrifices involved. The real payoff is taking from the majority of society, and giving to the minority. 2) As I've mentioned in my earlier argument, I do believe that financial help is the solution. I think that race-blind financial help is the most effective in this case, so I'm glad we agree on this. This still does not answer my argument about how you are punishing the current generation for the intolerance of the former generation. This is akin to punishing your children for a mistake you committed. Is this truly fair? 3) Dealing with the point on taxes, there are two reasons why it's a faulty analogy. Firstly, taxes are willingly given by the population. Should you choose to disagree, you can vote for a different government or leave the country. However, in the case of college admissions, students cannot choose to pass on their opportunities to minority race students, it has been chosen for them by the college who cannot be removed or challenged by the students. Secondly, just because people agree that poor people should be helped does not mean that they agree how they should be helped. For example, I would definitely agree with you that poor people should be given assistance when applying for colleges. However, if you proposed giving each and every individual under the poverty line a free scholarship for college, then I would disagree with you. If colleges started implementing minimum quotas for minority races, do you think that the majority race would readily agree with the policy? I honestly doubt so. Issue 3: Does affirmative action bring more benefits than harm? Here I will deal with his substantive points. 1) ""The first benefit is that it brings higher education to everyone."" - There is a very dangerous assumption here that everyone is capable of ""higher education"". We have seen the famous college dropouts Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. People are gifted in different areas, some in academia, others in vocational skills, and others in the arts. Just because you send everyone to college doesn't mean everyone will successfully earn a degree. Therefore, expanding higher education to everyone does not necessarily mean a rise in graduates. - Taking this point further, consider the ramifications when minority race students, who were less qualified than other applicants, do not do well in college. They will fuel racist rhetoric against their entire race, because they were given priority to college but did not do well with the opportunity. - Pro stated that ""The median wealth for most minorities, according to the report, is 10 times less than it is for Caucasians."" If this is true, government schemes to benefit the poor would lift most minorities up anyway. Government subsidies for education would help minority race students to compete with richer students in academia, allowing those that strive to continue their education. Why should we implement an additional and unnecessary policy when current policies already help those who need it? 2) ""The second benefit is that it spreads racial diversity"" - I agree that racial diversity is important and a good thing. But the issue here isn't about whether or not racial equality is a good thing (it definitely is), the issue is how best can we achieve this racial diversity? - In the case of the motion, it is effectively a top-down approach to racial diversity, where colleges artificially inflate the population of minority races to make their college appear ""diverse"". Are we truly satisfied with such a facade? I argue that it would be much better if minority races, through their own effort and merit, qualified for more places in college and hence created a more diverse environment. - The question here is: is it better to engineer a racially diverse environment, or to provide the right conditions for one to flourish? The most prominent problems of artificially creating one is that lies dampen the spirit of racial equality. When colleges are exemplified as paragons of racial diversity when it is known that racial quotas exist, it makes a mockery out of the equality movement and its achievements so far. Issue 4: ""Legally justified"" This deals with the final substantive on Pro's case. Firstly, just because something is legal does not make it morally correct. A good example is slavery, which was once legalised because African slaves were legally declared as 'not human'. However, we all know how slavery is morally heinous. Secondly, even if Pro counter-argues that the legality of an act is part and parcel of today's morality (therefore, slavery was moral by the standards of the past because it was legal in the past), this is still faulty logic. Pro must demonstrate conclusively that legal standards set moral standards, and not the other way round. Here I will show you why society's moral standards dictate legal standards, thereby disproving Pro's substantive by showing that it has the causation the wrong way round. - The people who set laws are the legislative body. In the US, this is Congress. In the UK, this is the Parliament. Hence, if Congress or Parliament decides to pass a new law banning alcohol for every person below the age of 21, then this become legislation and will be enforced by the police (executive branch) and the courts (judicial branch). - The lawmakers are democratically elected by the people through state/county/other geographical denominations elections. Therefore, it can be said that the aggregate opinion of the Congress or Parliament is representative of the aggregate opinion of the population of the country. People make their moral standards evident through the outcome of voting, when they select a candidate who is pro-abortion than anti-abortion. Therefore, laws are reflective of society's opinions on what is right and wrong, because people, with their own moral standards, elect a representative whom then passes legislature which enshrines these moral standards as law. - This proves Pro's case wrong because laws cannot be said to be the predominant force for shaping society's moral standards. Even for children, parents and social norms are much stronger tools for moulding the child's moral compass compared to the law. In conclusion, it's unjustified, unnecessary, and counterproductive to true racial equality."	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sbe4c5eb9-A278a658f	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	We should sacrifice the freedom of the individual to pursue equality.	We are trying to solve the problem of discrimination. The root of this problem lies within people's minds, so if you want to solve it you would have to change the way people think. This can only happen gradually. I can't really respond to your suggestion of affirmative action and diversity quotas as they lack context - do you mean affirmative action in education? diversity quotas in the job market? There are a million different ways you can implement these policies - some could be beneficial and others downright crazy. Generally, though, I think it is a bit naive to think that you can quickly solve problems of discrimination. There just isn't a way to change people's conceptions of the world quickly. I'd like some sources about serious economists advocating for the abolishment of the free market, and letting all economic planning and property be distributed by the government. (This is what I was arguing against.) I don't know the other economists, but I do know that Keynes advocated for temporary increases in government spending in order to stimulate the economy. From this I infer that he supported market economies, which, as I said, inevitably cause inequality. Regarding China - First of all, China dropped tariffs. Tariffs are not like embargos. They are self imposed policies that tax imports. The drop of tariffs was PART OF China's embrace of the open market. They were not seperate phenomena. This embracing of the open market was what caused it to succeed economically (this is supported by the International Monetary Fund: https://www.imf.org...) The upturn in the world economy affected every country, not just China. But only China grew at an amazing rate. (This growth didn't stop even after the upturn in the world economy ended - proving the upturn wasn't a significant factor in the Chinese economy's success.) This caused the emergence of a Chinese middle class (the vast majority of Chinese people were poor before they made markets free) and reduced suffering much more effectively than their old socialist system. I would also like to clarify that I am not against any and all levels of socialization. I even spoke highly of Nordic countries and welfare states. What I am against is COMPLETE* equality, because to attain that is to abolish market economies. This would hurt people economically and greatly increase their suffering. Suffering is best relieved by capitalist economies with good welfare - and once you don't have suffering you don't have much justification to take away people's freedoms.

57	Sbba2ba62-A45fffde1	2	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action is harmful.	Many thanks to PRO for instigating this contest, and for having completed it. As is customary, I will introduce no new arguments this round, but will only offer a brief review and rebuttals. Overview: In this contest, Pro states, without sources or supporting data, that AA allows for the hiring of less qualified minorities over whites. I have pointed out, with supporting evidence from the actual US Dept. of Labor policy itself, that this is not true. AA Only takes race, gender; etc. into account to ensure that these things are not used as the Federal government makes hiring, advancement and recruiting decisions. This misunderstanding represents the heart of the Affirmative Action debate. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Con never responds to my pointing out his hijacking of the resolution, and instead continues to argue under the definition of affirmative action that he has provided. I used the definition that PRO provided in R1. The definition includes a link to a Wiki page, which makes detailed mention of the Dept of Labor Policy that forms Affirmative Action policy in the US. This debate was about whether or not affirmative action is fair or unfair. Con has not met this burden, and has instead attempted to argue that affirmative action doesn't take race into consideration at all. The debate was to cover whether or not AA is harmful, as stipulated by PRO in R1. I have shown that AA policies are critical in requiring perhaps the largest nationwide employer (the Federal Government) to adopt policies that eliminate race, gender, veteran or disability status and national origin from consideration when recruiting, advancement and job placement decisions are made. As for the hiring of less qualified individuals, I never said that minorities or women were less qualified. Quoting PRO: - (AA) “doesn't lead to the most qualified employee being hired.” - (AA) “harms fairness by taking jobs and scholarships from more qualified individuals in preference of people only meant to fill a quota.” - “the obvious injustice of denying an qualified individual a job so that it could be given to a less qualified individual is obvious enough” Statements such as these demonstrate the need for AA policies that help to eliminate race, gender, veteran status, etc. from hiring and advancement decisions; employers can hold horrible views of other genders and races without even being aware of it. PRO also includes in his performance several statements that are intended to compliment minorities, such as praising them for overcoming the difficult childhood, poverty and so forth that he assumes they might have had. Note to Pro: Congratulating minorities on overcoming a life of hardships is not a compliment. Make sure that they fit that condescending stereotype first. Not all black people are poor, uneducated, or “less qualified.” What this argument is actually saying, is that when we have to consider race, religion, color, gender and national origin in the hiring process, we end up hiring people because they meet a quota instead of their abilities. Which is exactly what Affirmative action was created to stop. Passing up better qualified persons because of race, gender, national origin or veteran status… in order to hire the white guy. Final Notes: -Pro fundamentally misunderstands what AA is, and has based his premise on this faulty understanding -AA does not take race into consideration, as proven by the actual language of the policy itself (R2) -AA uses the massive hiring power of the federal government to eliminate race, gender, religion or other irrelevant criteria from hiring, placement, and recruiting decisions are made (R3)	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	S23134f94-A6e7d5f13	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	New Star Wars Movie is Racist	"We think in words. We talk in words. We make decisions based on words. The best way to control a population and those in society actions is to control their thoughts. The best way to control their thoughts is through words. My opponent and people in the comment section claims this is a debate about semantics. Perhaps they are right. However this discussion and debate is much larger than if the new Star Wars is racist. This debate is a parable for the nation. Knowing what you are discussing is very, very important and unfortunately too many people do not know what they are talking about. In the end, I don""t care if you vote for me, or my opponent. As long as I have succeeded in sharing some knowledge about the bigger picture of ""RACISM"", the victory of this debate has no relevance, it""s a ""bigger picture"" area. My opponent""s original claim was that the new star wars movie was racist. So what is racism? In short it""s a belief that inherent differences among groups involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to dominate others or that a particular racial group is inferior to the others. http://dictionary.reference.com... When one makes a racist claim and the standard is set below what racism is, and that is affirmed, then future claims are easier to prove based on past experiences. Down this slippery slope, you start to get into redistribution of ""poor"" students to ""rich"" schools, or neighborhoods that must have ""low income housing"". Do not fall into the trap of arguing their point for them. Argue against their position not for it. Usually ending with some claim of ""fairness"". Choice of who is the actor in the movie should be based on who will play the part best, just as the choice of who gets into a college should be based on achievements and not quotas. Arguing quotas makes their position correct, only the wrongness is on the ratio not the system. If you start down that path, where does it end? The truth is the producers are interested in making money and having the best actors in each role makes that possible, not quotas or some other system of fairness. The only thing fair is to let the free market dictate with its pocket what movies succeed, not a predetermined staff race allocation. To pick a person based on race IS racism only if you think they couldn't do the job without assistance or that group is a superior actor. Specific to this debate topic of racism in Star Wars My opponent has discussed many racial undertones in and around the movie. I agree with many of his assertions both personal experiences and in the movie. I also agree with many of his feelings in the first round. But that agreement is not of racism. No one is making the assertion that there fewer whites in the movie because they are inferior "" either in the time of Star Wars or in real life. However, a valid claim of racism here would be blacks are superior actors as they will bring in more global money than whites will - an angle I am sure my opponent does not want to take. My opponent discusses the Fall of Han from his hero status and his weakened look. 30 years will do that. Regan single handedly destroyed the Soviet union and ended the cold war without a shot being fired. Whom died of alzheimes. Sometimes real life is pathetic. Art imitates life... My opponent points to Poe being an after though, who was not intended to be in the movie, however his appearance is ONLY because he is white. Racial yes, racism probably not. Discrimination, yes. My opponent shows how Princess leia, is no longer called a princess due to the feminists. This is PC culture and sexism is not at all racism. My opponent brings up the female storm trooper. She seems to be there just because she is female. Afirmitative action at work meeting quotes "" part of the original argument"" 52% off the world is female. You would think after reading my opponents statements this is something he would support. Sexism is not racism"" The question: Is is sexism that she has her job only because she is a woman or is it sexism to imply she is not good enough to get the job on her own therefore we need quotas? That luke is a drug addict is probably the realist part of the series. Many military vets turn to drugs after being exposed to war. Luke not only killed hundreds of people, but his own father "" in self defense. The narrative of Luke""s life actually makes sense. That has to mess one up! My opponent states minorities should have minor roles, however the nonwhite world makes up 80% of the world. For a world wide film distribution, the cast allocation seems appropriate to my opponents search for fairness. Which brings us to fairness. You cannot use such meaningless words. Another left liberal word. Fair. Pay your fair share etc"" It""s not fair that you live in that house and go to that school. Fair. Say what you mean. Fairness ALWAYS comes at another""s expense. There is no game of just winners. Say what you mean. Don't use the word fair and assume I know what you mean or I agree with your assumed use of ""fair"". I think letting the producers make the film as they want without artificial quotas is quite fair."	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sa18fac12-A34a6cd32	0	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	European Constitutional Monarchies Ought to be Dissolved	"Round 2I, too, would like to show my appreciation to my opponent for challenging me to this debate - it is greatly... appreciated. I'm sure we can fit some fun into what I hope shall be an eye-opening and interesting debate.Economic benefits of the MonarchyIt is integral to my side of this debate to stress that the monarchy is not, as is often claimed, a cause of net economic loss. I hope my opponent will not mind if I reference his graph (A). Interestingly, the graph suggests that in 2013/2014 the royal family cost the British Taxpayer the equivalent of 56 pence per person. This is, in fact, very close to the estimate that I have in a separate source [1] which suggests 53 pence per British person between 2012/2013. So we can assume that, currently, the royal family costs around 50-60 pence per person every year. This totals out at around £33.3 million a year (if using the 53 pence estimate). Admittedly, this is more money than I have in my bank account, but what if we factor in how much the presence of a royal family in the UK actually brings in via the tourist industry? Interestingly, my source [2] suggests that the tourism brought in by the royal family more than makes up for their expenses. Here is a direct quote:""The Royal family generate close to £500 million every year for British tourism with The Tower of London, Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace the most popular Royal destinations.""So if we detract £33.3 million from £500 million, we get £467 million, a sizable sum leftover! To address my opponents question as to whether or not I think a 'reform' of the British royal family is worth it, my answer is no. Let them keep the money flooding in!Now I'm going to address an argument that I know will rear it's ugly head at some point, and can also only be deemed to be a matter of eternal debate. Would tourists keep visiting the Palaces, Tower of London and other monarchy-associated sites even if the royal family themselves had been dissolved? The answer to this question is maybe, but nowhere near as many. Having said that, why should the UK take the risk anyway, as we have proved that the Royal Family more than make up for themselves economically!Now, this is a question of European Constitutional Monarchies, as my opponent has stated, so let's look at his graph too! Sorry about the use of your own sources against you, pro, but I feel the need to analyze all the available data! Now, it appears that, in some places, the monarchy is incredibly costly per person. A good example of this is Luxembourg's $22.20 per person. That is an incredible amount at face value. However, if you consider the fact that Luxembourg has the second highest GDP of any other country in the world [2] and the average citizen of Luxembourg earns twice the average salary of an American citizen, as well as its relatively small population size, perhaps we can explain that inflated value. It is noticeable that Spain only spends $0.23 per capita, which is lower than non-monarchic Germany's $0.46. This suggests that the difference per capita is not due to the status of the country as a monarchic or non-monarchic country, but more to do with the actions of the individuals who actually rule it. When it comes down to trust, I'd rather give my pin number to Queen Elizabeth II than this guy: Anyway, that's enough talk of economics, let's move on!Role in SocietyAlas, I thought we had finished with talk of economics, but it was not to be so! A fleeting mention shall suffice, however, to say that as I have proved that the royal family does not, in fact, cost a huge amount more than it brings in, we do not have to worry about any obscene vet bills or, indeed, any dying dogs (cats, or other animals) in the foreseeable future. In other words, the traditions of the royal family (in Britain at least) are not harming anybody (either physically, mentally, or economically) in their upkeep, so pro's argument that we should dispense with them due to the logic that we should put 'a dying dog down.' is negated, as there is no dying dog. In fact, the situation would be more akin to the putting down of a healthy sheepdog, simply because the sheep all ran away and therefore the sheepdog no longer has to perform the same duties as it used to, but is still perfectly able to run across the fields and participate as a good family pet! Such an action would simply be a ridiculous route to head down. Ok, enough with the analogies, there shall be no more sad puppy talk here! Pro rightly questions, what does the Royal Family actually do? Well, as quoted from my source [3]:""The Royal Family is apolitical, so they can represent their country’s culture without being a stand-in for controversial policies.""In other words, nobody would accuse the King or Queen of ordering the recent invasion of their country. It would be a ridiculous notion as that King or Queen is a constitutional monarch. This is where having very little political power can actually come in handy. The serving constitutional monarch is able to talk to international leaders in a way that the monarch's Prime Minister may have a hard time doing.But surely that's not all the monarch does to service their country? No, not in the slightest. [4]The Charities Aid Foundation estimated that the Queen brings in £1.4 Billion a year to charities collectively, in which she is patron. That, I hope pro will admit, is quite an impressive figure in itself. The Queen supports over 3000 charities worldwide, and that is just the Queen. Other members of the royal family, such as Princes Harry and William who have been known to support 16 charities, have done sterling work in helping those who need it most. What about other European Royal Families? Well, they certainly appear to be keeping their people happy in one way or another, as King Harald V of Norway [4] enjoys a 93% approval rating with the Norwegian people! I do not suggest that attempting to take their monarchy from them will be a particularly popular movement.Perhaps, in order to truly understand whether or not dissolving the monarchy is the key to making a country happy and successful, we should ask a country which has already done that! According to a poll taken in the USA, [5] Queen Elizabeth II held a 61% approval rating with. If this is compared to Barrack Obama's 45.5% approval rating, it's entirely possible that America might soon be petitioning their government for a Royal Family of their own! Queen Elizabeth II has seen through 11 US Presidents, 12 British Prime Ministers, 14 New Zealand Prime Ministers, 13 Australian Prime Ministers, and 11 Canadian Prime Ministers. She has been a symbol of Britain for 62 years and in that time she has served her realm with care and respect for others. She has been an incredible role model for her citizens and, whilst urging him to take these factors, as well as those listed above, into consideration, I pass the mic over to Pro!

57	Safbe98b8-Aad194cef	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action is Justifiable and Constitutional	"To review my response to the claims of favoring in correlation with ""discrimination"" please refer back to the first paragraph of my argument in Round 2. To review my response to the claims of lowering of standards please reread my argument in Round 3. The absence of a quotas delegitimizes the practice of lowering standards to force a certain number of minorities filling positions (see Regents of the University of California vs Bakke) I'd like to reiterate the necessity of the distinction to be made between the execution of a policy and the actual content of a policy. This is important to note when considering the statistics you mentioned regarding the disparities between the qualified, the admitted, and the overlap. Again, I stand against the lowering of standards that favors the COMPLETELY unqualified for those that are and if this is the case in any instance it breaches the premises Affirmative Action. This goes for the notion that Asians and Whites are being discriminated against. Secondly, I feel it important to reiterate that Affirmative Action doesn't exist to make race the end all factor. A Survey done by the National Association for College Admission Counseling's State of Admissions concluded that only 3% of institutions indicate that race has ""considerable influence"", 11% ""moderate influence"", and 19% limited influence in Admissions decisions. Overall only one third of 4 year public and private institutions consider race in any ways. There are still 14 other criteria that dictate admission (ie test scores, GPA, writing samples, and)extracurricular activities) (1) Race is simply one (but fairly relevant) factor to consider given America's historically racist tendencies in both professional and social spheres. From complete denial of education to slaves to denial of admission to educational institutions post slavery to admission to below subpar educational conditions with equally subpar resources under ""separate but equal"" policies to statistics alleging the disproportionate representation of minorities in higher institutions. To say that in the last example corresponding to current events with minorities in institutions of higher education, given the periods before it were marked by racist (either overt or subversive)motives and approaches, is suddenly devoid of any racial factors or consideration is irrational. And your mention of either prospective or current stigmas that result on racial premises in the wake of Affirmative Action underlines the same type of racist tendencies you claim don't exist. The questioning of someone's qualifications are unwarranted if the circumstances of their employment and/or education are unknown (given that they can provide necessary credentials) and could only surface on racist principles. So you subvert your own argument against the notion of tendencies towards racial classification in American society. On the matter of Affirmative Action's constitutionality, let us remember that the 15th amendment predated the Civil Rights Act and the circumstances that constituted its exigence by nearly a century (15th Amendment ratified 1870, Civil Rights Act 1964) and the 19th Amendment predates the second wave feminist movement by half a century. So the sudden realization that those same Amendments are suddenly in a large margin working against the collective majority is dubious. To respond to your point on systemic racism again. For the sake of argument, even in the theoretical absence of current racist attitudes, you're telling me that centuries of racial inequality and oppression isn't bound to have long lasting social consequences regarding socioeconomic status and cultural disadvantages with involved minority groups COMBINED with the fact that being a minority in any society from any lens, puts said minorities at an automatic disadvantage because systems and societies are created to benefit and sustain the majority of constituents in said society and rightly so. One could argue that ""minority"" in any those cases doesn't immediately translate to race which is true HOWEVER my claim is that America has historically chosen that lens to view its own inhabitants and that's not exclusive to Blacks, even European Immigrants endured a period of discrimination and persecution due to race and ethnicity which faded near the turn of the 21st century with the near lack of physical disparity. Hispanics, Asian, and even those from the Middle East have faced similar discrimination as recent as the last decade. And while this isn't an argument of who has suffered more, it is more a historical review to show America's inclinations towards race based classification and discrimination that have ALWAYS served to benefit a white majority at the expense of racially obscured minority, and to say that those events and that lens have had little ronni impact on America's current social and economic fabric is preposterous. Furthermore, to say that deeply rooted systemically instituted ideologies have COMPLETELY phased out in a matter of a decade or two does not stand up under scrutiny. In conclusion, I am not proposing that every instance that falls under the category of Affirmative Action is perfect. As undoubtedly demonstrated, no policy that has sought to bring about racial equality has been executed perfectly and has taken decades to a century to bring about desired results. I noted in the comments the legislation of policies as supplemental to Affirmative Action to make its impact more efficient and effective a possibility. However, I did and do affirm that Affirmative Action is perfectly justifiable given numerous historical injustices that have pervaded our current social climate on various levels as I have also proved that under the thumb of strict scrutiny, Affirmative Action maintains its constitutionality as far as the government deems it as an interest in forwarding its own motives dictated by its constituents. While the ideal of a true meritocracy is certainly desirable by both myself and my opponent, to state that such would be return to an already once established standard of American society is a fallacy given that such has never been the case historically with regards to discrimination against minorities even in the presence of worthy merit. And while Affirmative Action cannot solely remedy that or be the driving mechanism for such social change, it is a perfectly viable factor to strive towards those ideals.

57	Scee72b1d-A4ba3f04a	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

Broadening participation	The talent pool in South African rugby is not as racially diverse as one would expect from the “Rainbow Nation” – some commentators have argued that England and France produce more top level black players than South Africa[1]. This is because top level players are a result of development from the grassroots up. Targets or quotas could not only improve the talent pool of today, but could broaden it for the future. A new generation of youth across all races in South Africa would be able to see that rugby union is a sport that accepts people from their backgrounds, making them more likely to participate in rugby union, either as players, coaches, referees or as a general part of the rugby fraternity.

57	S9f3db814-A5b044265	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action should be based on Socio-Economic Status and not race or religion	I realise the purpose of AA is to give equal opprotunity. Minorities do not have this due to current racism in America. However, as Booker T. Washington and I have previously proven, SES and racism are directly corrilated. Again, to kill racism you need to chop out at the roots (SES) not cut down the trunk (What AA would do). If you cut down the trunk you may have a much smaller tree, but it still has the potential to grow to greater heights. AA would give minorites more or less opprotunity, but the roots of racism, SES would not be rooted out. It still would have the potential to grow. As my opponent has stated, previous laws concerning banning racism have not been completely effective because 'quite obviously the point here is that while this discrimination is in fact illegal, PEOPLE ARE BIASED ANYWAY as the example regarding names proves' as my opponent has stated. With AA people would still beleive to have reason for racism and their racist bias would either grow or consistantly need to be choped down. However, SAA roots out the cause of racism, kills it, and ensures equal opprotunity for all. My opponent next points out that Jews and Asians, once discriminated against races, now provide the US with high SES professions. May I respectfully remind my opponent that Asians, as I have previously proven (refer back), were once barred from all decent jobs due to racism. It has been progressively, not imedietly, that they have obtained high SES and, in effect, ended racial prejudice against them. My opponent has before stated that there are mulitple laws that assist the poor already. Firstly, I would like to point out that there are multiple laws, already proven in my debate, that fight against racism. Furthermore, the laws that help the poor only help the poor stay poor. Social mobility is a phenominal acomplishment. However, because it is so difficult to acheive it proves how tyranical the elitist can be. They often are prevented from success not because they aren't smart enough, not because they aren't hard working enough, but because, as my opponent has stated, 'These limited opportunities happen to be based on nothing but sheer bad luck in terms of what kind of life people were born into.' SAA is a law that attempts to eliminate much of or eliminate completely the unfair advantage of birth. It would be unfair to whites, blacks, hispanics, asians, native americans, or any other race to be born in a situation where there is so little likelyhood they will succeed. Being a minority is not a disadvantage in itself, but being born into low SES or being steryotyped as an ineffective or even dangerous member of society due to generalsations concerning your race is. The wealthy, capable black man my opponent keeps refering to is obviosly a victum of racism. To eliminate racism one must chop out the roots. If AA instead of SAA is put into action, people will 'STILL BE BIASED ANYWAYS' and still deny him the job. However, if the roots are cut out the ideal of racism will be proven false and therefore die. Furthermore, including the poor white man in SAA will end racism. Impoverished people, regardless of their race, would be given equal opprotunity. Race would not be a focous or factor. You are looked upon not as black or white, but as a human being. That truly was MLK's dream. Finally, with all respect, race in and of itself does not create a culture. Social conditions create a culture. Integrating people with ideals, beleifs, and talents assosiated with low SES would create far more diversity than only being intrested in the integration of race in and of itself. I have already adiquetly proven this (refer back) As I have previously stated, there are always exceptions. Not every wealthy voter, no matter what race he is, will vote directly based on SES. In fact, the point that there is still variation among black voters within various classes further proves that social condtion, not race, is responsible for beleifs because the same can be said for members of all races concerning their voting habits. If it is true, as my opponent has stated, that diversity in color and sex for the sake of diversity in color and sex, is the central focus of AA, than my opponent has concerned that AA truly is a racist ideology. MLK dreamed of a day where no one would be judged by the color of their skin. AA clearly assumes MLK's dream is somewhat false and therefore can be bended. SAA has a firm loyalty to Dr. King's dream to not only judge others based on who they are but to help others based on their need regardless of race. My opponent beleives that SAA would not work because it would create a racist society. However, as I have previously stated, SAA is not concerned with the color of your skin, but on the degree of your need. If 'Color-blind seniority systems tend to protect White workers against job layoffs, because senior employees are usually White' they are not color blind. They see white as superior to black. However, sometimes such events occur not because of racism but because perhaps the white worker may legidimatley be a better employee than the black man. If this is the case than those accusing others of racism are racist themselves. They cannot understand that being nondiscrimniatory requires one to subject members of all races to the same laws. If one violates a law or works poorly, whether they be white or black, they will be punished in the same manner as if a member of another race had done the same thing. I would like to thank my opponent for an enjoyable, challenging, and eye opening debate. I had a run for my money in this debate and complement my opponent on his or her intellegence and talent. I wish my opponent the best of luck in the voting period. To my opponent: thank you and good luck.	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	S92cb50da-A52d260d2	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action	"Since your argument exhibits a lack of understand of what affirmative action really is, I'll show you the laws pertaining to affirmative action. Executive Order No. 10925, President John F. Kennedy http://www.thecre.com... ""(1) The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the contracting officer setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. ""(2) The contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin."" Here's the part you have been ignoring. Notice the word ""qualified"" in the second clause. Executive Order Nos. 11246 and 11375, President Lyndon B. Johnson http://www.eeoc.gov... http://www.uhuh.com... No. 11375 amended No. 11246. These orders required that all organizations that accept federal funds take affirmative action to increase employment of minorities and women. With that said, let's get to your arguments. Your first argument shows a lack of understanding of affirmative action. Affirmative action is not a racial quota. It doesn't require that a certain amount of each minority be hired. It requires that affirmative action be taken to employ minorities and women. So your example is just false. Also, even if it were a racial quota, no racial quota would require that Asians be employed at a 5:12 rate to whites. The Asian-American population in the United States makes up almost 6% of the white population. A 5:12 ratio, on the other hand, would be 41.7%. So, not only is your example false, but it's also unrealistic. It would obviously be a good thing if qualified Latinos and African-Americans got a job at the man's business if they wouldn't have normally. If you read the affirmative action laws, they only apply to qualified candidates. So, it would only be the man's fault if he's hiring unqualified applicants. First of all, the whites would not have lost jobs if they did not have them in the first place. They just didn't get the jobs. And the second part is just a baseless claim. Again, affirmative action law applies only to qualified applicants. If the man is hiring unqualified applicants, that is entirely his fault. It is a rather ignorant generalization to say those whites hate affirmative action and the Latino and the African-American. First of all, you used a straw man argument. A racial quota is not affirmative action, so they're not truly hating affirmative action. Secondly, it's very irrational to hate someone just because they beat you out for a job. The Latino and the African-American would be qualified for the job if they were hired for affirmative action. You said, ""People argue that it gives minorities more opportunities. It equally robs majorities of their opportunities."" A percentage is the only thing that would prove your claim. It does not. It does not equally rob majorities of their opportunities because it affects a much smaller portion of the majority. You said it ""equally"" robbed majorities and I'm holding you to that claim. And you keep claiming that someone lost a job. That is just not true. In order for them to lose the job, they would have to have the job in the first place. I've explained this already. If both candidates are qualified and the white candidate is slightly more qualified, the minority's account has to be taken into consideration. I didn't say the universities and workplaces should just represent the demographics. I said they should more accurately represent the demographics of society. In a society in which all men are supposedly created equal, there is no reason that everyone shouldn't be given equal opportunity. As reflected in the workplace and universities, blacks still haven't been given equal opportunity. The example from Thomas Sowell is completely irrelevant to this argument. Affirmative action applies to qualified candidates. I have never seen an argument in support of affirmative action involving a black candidate who is much more qualified than the white candidate. It's pretty well established that Tiger Woods is one of the best, if not the best, professional golfers ever. Comparing him to an average pro golfer does not apply to an affirmative action debate at all. Sowell's point is pretty much garbage because the minority and women candidates are qualified. A less-qualified candidate, but still a qualified candidate, is not going to result in a huge loss of profit. The Tiger Woods situation hurts his argument since the typical affirmative action case involves a minority who is slightly less qualified than a white male candidate. This is simply your own view. Just because you would feel resentment toward affirmative action, that person, the minority group, and government, doesn't make your resentment rational. It doesn't make it righteous. In a diverse environment, a white male will obviously become more accepting and open to new cultures. You then make the baseless claim that the Hispanics and African-Americans who would be affected by eliminating affirmative action aren't naturally qualified to get into qualified. First of all, I have no idea why you use the word ""naturally"". Secondly, you're failing to take into account the disadvantages the Hispanics and African-Americans have faced in life. Race and class still intersect. Many minority schools are underfunded, as shown in several studies, including one from the Education Trust. Predominantly black schools have shown to not offer as many AP classes, hurting students' GPA's. I'm not going to dignify your hypothetical situation with a response until you can prove that it's realistic. Just being in the North didn't exclude African-Americans from discrimination. Being in the North didn't automatically give them equal opportunity. Also, you should back up your claim that most of the African-Americans benefiting from affirmative action came from the North. Affirmative Action also helps lower class minorities and women. Your summary of affirmative action is far too basic and frankly intellectually dishonest. Affirmative action has demonstrated that it has not only helped minorities, but it has also helped women. As I said before, some people have to take up a burden to promote a social good, which affirmative action is. I am a middle-class white and I am fine with this burden. Your claim that employers end up making less profit has little to no empirical data to support it. You haven't provided that data yet. And it's a gross oversimplification to say that majorities feel resentment toward minorities who ""robbed them of their jobs"". Your use of the word ""robbed"" is quite funny. The majority would have to have the job in the first place in order to be robbed. You can continue to show small things that are wrong with affirmative action or give hyperbolic situations. But it does not attack the policy as whole. The main point I would make to you is that the reason many minorities seem less qualified because of their systemic exclusion, whether it be underfunding for their schools or discrimination in some other way."

57	Se3a3e8b3-Ae37df239	1	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Official TOC Round 1	"I thank my opponent for his response. I will attempt some form of organization, but it's tough. Counterplan: 1. Perm it. Not only is my case's AA generally color-blind anyway, but it is only *not* color blind if a student chooses to identify as a specific minority on a college application. Just don't check the box. 2. The Con ignores the fact that A.A. only has only contains *some* weighting, and that it includes far more minorities than just ethnic. He doesn't address the fact that A.A. is now primarily an education and confrontation program within the public sector, and that quotas have been entirely abolished. 3. Even if he does win counterplan, he doesn't win the debate. He's saying something like: if I give $10 to help the Darfur refugees instead of giving $20, then I've done nothing good for the Darfur refugees."" It's all positive reform, which affirms. On the 3 questions/necessity of AA: 1. Sowell is taken out of context. Badly. Sowell never argues that African Americans are more inherently dangerous than any other ethnicity. Furthermore, Sowell is basically a libertarian Jared Diamond. His works espouse the view that multiple factors play into the development of a person, so he would never, ever claim that African Americans are inherently violent or criminal. 2. My case is not race-centered, even though my opponent is unfairly focusing the debate thusly because he doesn't seem to be able to accept the fact that minorities are not only ethnic. Straw man much? 3. To address my opponent's questions: a. Yes. b. No, and I never claim to, nor is this necessary to claiming the benefits of my case. c. Can my opponent please explain to me a situation in which racism is deserved? How about sexism? Ageism? Bigotry at this level is precisely why an educational system like A.A. is an absolute necessity within society. On increased segregation: My opponent missed the boat here. I encourage him to re-read my statements. I said that segregation is worse due to factors outside of AA that increased due to resistance to the educational steps AA was taking to correct the subjugation of minorities. See: white flight, for example, which my opponent drops, as well as negative response through anti-AA legislation. On placating the complaining kid: By my opponent's logic, women's suffrage is spoiling women, because clearly they don't have the capacity to vote properly; women are stupider than men, genetically, just like black taxi cab drivers are inherently dangerous. So, we should reverse women's suffrage, and everything ""will go back to normal."" My opponent ignores the fact that when a problem exists, like women not voting or minorities being abusively discriminated against, we solve the problem. That's not awarding a spoiled child; that's correcting abuses against the child. On CPR: As detailed in the source I cited at the bottom of my case, the Confronting Prejudices Response (CPR) Model is the current AA model for the entire nation. Besides the weighting of *some* college applications, this model entails 2 things: 1) Education with regards to cultural diversity, tolerance, & other information necessary to debunk bigoted stereotypes regarding race; 2) Confrontation & mediation of instances of prejudice or discrimination, much like a peer mediation program in a school or in a workplace. On public sector: An equalized public sector simply means that each grouping of people has an equal shot at education and employment. Con's ""counter plan"" equalizes the public sector by giving favor to the disadvantaged, as well. So, clearly, he's contradicting himself massively, because he wants the disadvantaged to be assisted, but only if *he* believes they should be assisted, empirical warrants be damned. On the professor to student conversations: 1. The conversation you are imagining is flawed for 3 reasons: A. Weighting systems don't penalize. They add points to designated areas. Supreme Court precedence makes it illegal to add points to an application to the point where reverse discrimination occurs. I recommend reading the University of Michigan cases I cite in my case. B. Assignments vs. college applications are apples & oranges. Just because they both start with an ""A"" and happen in or around universities does not make them correlative in any way. C. I remind you that, on an application, the applicant can mitigate AA on their own, if their individual ideology conflicts with the policies, by simply choosing not to identify their minority status. D. This microcosmic example in no way proves that AA has not produced positive reform. 1 person's objections doesn't equate to indication of social change. On majorities not being hired & rewarding random people: 1. My opponent is arguing quotas here, which are clearly non-resolutional, since quotas haven't been used since the 1990's. AA, especially in the workforce, is based on the CPR model that I outline. If the public sector is hiring more minorities (warrant?), it is not a product of AA as outlined in my sources & case. 2. If by ""random people,"" my opponent is referring to those groups that have been historically abused & robbed of their natural human rights, then sure. Whether they have reached their full potential or not is highly debatable. I would argue, based on historical precedence, culturally accepted fact, & my sources, that these populations don't have full ability to reach the potential of the majority due to the same factors that, funnily enough, Thomas Sowell writes about in his commentaries & books. On the drastic reduction of minority college admittants: Apparently, my opponent would be far happier in a ""normal"" world in which only white males are allowed to attend college, or work in a blue collar establishment. The numbers were never high for minority acceptance. Cross-apply my equalizing the public sector arguments. On correlation of poverty & race: 1. My opponent is straw manning me here. I make no correlation whatsoever, except to say that minority populations, including the socio-economically disadvantaged, perform poorly on standardized tests. The socio-economically disadvantaged can be any ethnicity. I never said they couldn't be. 2. I didn't assume that any ethnicity was poorer than any other. Based on the common knowledge of discrimination statistics, White populations & Asian-American populations are stereotyped as being more apt, hence statistics show them favored by higher education and the workplace. That's all I said. 3. You are making the assumption that White & Asian-Americans are automatically *more* qualified for a given position merely because they identify with those ethnicities. On the ""brilliant"" plan of weighting: My opponent doesn't get AA. Extend my definitions & framing in RD 1 (no one is correlating ethnicity with poverty directly—that's just my opponent). On my Supreme Court Warrants: 1. So, are you attempting to claim that ""beem0r"" is on equal footing in shaping American policy to The US Supreme Court? My argument is not an appeal to authority, but a legitimate citation of the framing of AA in the 21st century. Wanna give me a *good* reason why we shouldn't consider their ruling legitimate to this debate? On the negative ""advocacy"" at the bottom of RD 1: 1. I find it laughable that my opponent accuses me of making insulting generalizations about minorities. Which one of us was the one who claimed that all black cab drivers were more violent? I forget… 2. My opponent is arguing only partially within the scope of the resolution. He is attempting to debate the 1990's version of AA, which is not what I've established as AA, nor is it what AA really is. Even if my opponent can salvage some harms out of the weighting system, which he can't, he is still losing all of the benefits I can claim for all *other* minorities he ignores, as well as ethnic minorities."

57	S6544f236-A532bc68e	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Stereotypes Cannot and Should Not be Eradicated	I do respect your position and completely accept your stance. I am Con (against) on this debate. I do not believe that stereotypes should stay I also do not believe that is it impossible or at the very least, improbable to remove stereotypes. I will happily use your definitions unless I feel as though you are creating a logical fallacy with word play, or I have a better defined example. Stereotypes are a result of confirmation bias due to a lack of education on what is portraying a stereotype. For example, if I say conspiracy theorists are tin-foil-hat antigovernment 'wackos' I have just created or agreed with a stereotype; and I have done this because of some extreme people who actually fit into this category. Like-wise, if I suggest that in a high crime populated area where minority figures are the majority of criminals, if I was to walk down a street at night and come across a person that fits into a category of minority, I will assume or lean towards assuming they are a criminal or have the potential to be one. Another example is to say that homeless people are all homeless because they 'did it to them selves', with this dogmatic mindset, you will view most if not all homeless people like this. This is where I would like to change the course and look at current stereo-types that are just bad. When we look at equal rights for women, we tend to think, voting, driving, employment, education etc, however a lot of the time we forget just how a lot of people treat women. If you look at authority figures in the US very few are female, if we look at people who are viewed as 'strong, courageous, tough and driven', it is not often women are the centre point at this. Just with that ALONE, we will see and do see a lack of respect for women unless they prove themselves. If a man with a suit is walking down the street, people will generally think that this man has got everything in his life in check and is in a position of respect or authority, or both. If a women does the same thing, she is looked at in a sexual way, she is judged by her hair, posture, if she is tired or smiling. Suddenly we see a trend of judgemental behaviour instead of respect; now I am not saying she would not be treated with respect, but there is a CLEAR correlation between attraction in females and success in females. A quick way to refute your argument that cultures can't be changed, look at any country in the Middle East coming over to a Western country like Australia or America. We can see the new generation that is not restricted by religion has no affiliation with the cultures or trends from their heritage. Looking over history and seeing parts of Asia going through the ages of technology, at one point they had samurai swords, now most have technology and have grown past this. So we can define a stereotype as ignorant, misinformed or simply an observation. However to address everyone with it is bigoted and ignorant. We will slow down our growth as a civilisation if we continue this path. “Many people want to seem void of stereotypes and judgements so they will go against a gut feeling of danger to trust a person they do not know.” What people should be doing is not trusting someone because they don’t look trustworthy. Not because they’re black with a hoody on and are too afraid to look like a racist. “Stereotypes breed certain fear and caution in people that can help protect them from danger.” Possibly, however we aren’t living in a forest where one mountain lion won’t charge you so you think all won’t. We are living in a modern time with education, simply because one person is a lower class liar, it does not mean all will. “Stereotyping can be accurate and help people to assume things about a person correctly. If a woman wears a hijab, you would more often than not rightfully assume she's Muslim. This can help in now knowing what foods they cannot have if dining with them or help promote conversation. Assuming things correctly can make a person seem more knowledgeable and sensitive to others. Implicit or mild stereotypes cannot be and should not be eradicated from our society.” Firstly, you just changed your argument, secondly, identifying clothing and assuming is falls under stereotype, but it does not implicate something negative over a person like ‘women can’t drive’ or ‘Asians are really smart.’ This is simply offensive.

57	Sa3cff50e-Aefcaa5c6	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	More women in the labour market leads to higher GDP	By introducing gender quotas to ensure gender equality, one could not only increase the labour force by bringing more women but also enhance the labour productivity and the available talent pool in a country. This would stimulate businesses to expand, innovate, and compete. This process has an effect of raising tax revenue and social security payments. The overall effect is the positive growth of the economy.   Therefore, addressing social injustice and higher economic returns are mutually supportive goals. This argument is particularly relevant for qualified women who could be hired at executive positions, but are prevented from doing so due to cultural beliefs, societal practices, and lack of economic and institutional support. A study by Asa Löfström on the links between economic growth and productivity in the labour market argues that if women’s productivity level rises to the level of  men’s, Europe’s GDP could grow 27% which makes women’s participation is of crucial importance to Europe’s economy.[1] Quotas would allow for a better utilisation of the talent pool; as currently, 59% of the students graduating from Europe’s higher educational institutes are women.[2] With the current access to education and the introduction of quotas against barriers of existing prejudices, women will have incentives and support to increase their productivity In the case of Norway, the quota law requires all public, state-owned , municipal, inter-municipal and cooperative companies to appoint at least 40% women on their boards per 2008. The law led to a fast increase from 6% women on boards of public limited companies in 2002 to 36% in 2008.[3] [1] Löfström, Asa. Gender Equality, Economic Growth and Employment.

There is no doubt that rugby is a sport where South Africa could be stronger if it was popular in all racial groups, but they are a blunt instrument: the way to pick the best team is to simply pick the best team. Racial equality comes when no one is picked as a result of race whether that is through negative or positive discrimination.	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sbba2ba62-Ad3b8a9e	2	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action is harmful.	Before I get into some more specific arguments, there are a couple of housekeeping issues that need to be taken care of. The most important of which is to clarify that the alternative to affirmative action is not blatant racism. When I make the argument that it is a bad thing to enforce policies based on race, color, religion and national origin, I do not conclude that policies should be put into place which harm others based on these things. Instead I place a call to value people based on their skills and to leave race, color, religion and national origin out of the question entirely. Next, I want to point out that it is unacceptable to simply ignore an argument, no matter how poor you personally find it to be. I would appreciate it if my opponent would treat me with more respect than that and actually responded to my argument on hardships. Con undermines my arguments further throughout his previous round, but I'm confident that the readers can see where for themselves. Finally, there was no reason for Con to redefine a term I had already clarified in the first round. Con's arguments are based on an alternative definition of affirmative action which functions differently than my own. The difference is a minor one, but it is important nonetheless. I'll get to that in a minute though. Before that I need to stress a theme my opponent seems to have ignored from my prior round; people are not Pokemon, you don't have to catch them all. I never claimed that affirmative action leads to unqualified employees being hired, I said that it doesn't lead to the most qualified employee being hired. Because companies and academic institutions want to diversify their employees and students they will overlook more qualified applicants in favor of those who meet a racial or gender-based quota. This is more obvious in the field of education, but this harm is present in the workplace as well; race-based scholarships are given out at just about every university in the US, while white students graduating high school with high honors get nothing. This behavior is harmful to fairness as it rewards traits beyond one's control instead of hard work, and to progress as it gives an education to one based on the same. I'm not sure why Con wants to conclude that this position assumes that minorities aren't capable of maintaining achievement based honors, but it's a wholly untrue. Moving on, we can now look at how my opponent's new definition fundamentally changes the debate to be skewed in his favor. First his definition includes veterans and the disabled, giving me a burden I shouldn't have. In the opening round I provide a definition which effectively limits Affirmative action to gender and race. Next, con places the term 'qualified' into his definition of Affirmative Action, cutting his burden down and seemingly invalidating my arguments. If these are qualified individuals then they should be able to find a job or be accepted into a school based on their own merit; the framing round as well as my previous round clearly illustrate that more than just qualified individuals are benefiting from Affirmative action. As for the straw man accusation, it's unfounded. Con never even refutes any of my arguments, and at one point openly admits to ignoring some of them. Meanwhile Con doesn't answer the fact that Affirmative action harms fairness by taking jobs and scholarships from more qualified individuals in preference of people only meant to fill a quota. Instead he actually means to claim that by me pointing out these injustices, I am insinuating that minorities are incapable of getting these positions by their own merit If anyone is assuming that minorities can't excel on their own, it's not me it's Con. In conclusion, we need to evaluate people based on what they can do, not the color of their skin. Affirmative action may benefit a few people, but on the whole it harms justice and progress immeasurably. Back to you Con!	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

57	S9cbc6ad4-A7a98c810	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Quotas are Inherently Helpful	Sometimes, it's not enough to talk about gender diversity. One has to put his or her money where his or her mouth is, and that means actually hiring women. Quotas are inherently helpful because they force businesses to adhere to the lofty goals they talk about in press releases. Simply put, a good quota is a promise that a company will actually care about diversity. How do we know that quotas are inherently helpful? It's easy - all we have to do is look at the sectors where quotas are already in place. Look at higher education, for example - not only are quotas in place, but they've been defended time and again as a necessity. Today's world sees more women and more people of color in universities than ever before, and that's something that's largely due to the quota system. Likewise, government positions are less overwhelmingly white and male than they have been in the past, and that's largely due to a government that embraces diversity and puts systems into place to make sure that the workplace remains diverse. It all comes down to money, though, and the Wall Street Journal writes that even large businesses agree that diversity targets are worth pursuing. Businesses that set targets and quotas are able to move ahead of the natural curve and put more minority voices in positions that make a difference. Simply put, quotas are already embraced as necessities in both the public and private sectors.	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed.

57	S9c7b8d3c-Ae1c024b	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Patriotism is Justifiable	"I appreciate my opponent's responses. This is the final round. ""My opponent now asserts that objects are equivalent to their parts. Consider a human being that had had all the connections between his atoms severed. According to my opponent's logic, he would still ""exist"" because the particles that made him up are still in existence. This can be applied to object or structure- a sword, a house, or a nation. Structure is irreducible to its components."" Unfortunately my opponent's argument is what is fundamentally flawed here. A human, by definition, certainly DOES have connections between the particles that make up the human - otherwise, said human is a collection of particles and no longer a human at all! The human ""exists"" as the parts that make up that human, no more, no less, and the connections between those parts are parts in themselves. Connections are not somehow a - physical entities that exist in another reality, they are just a much a part of the human being as the particles that make up the atoms that make up the human being. Regardless of the analogy, my opponent's argument remains flawed - if in the future all Canadians lived independently of one another or became self sufficient in some sense, they would remain part of the nation - state of Canada. They do not need to be ""connected"" in any sense to be part of a country, though they usually are. ""It isn't necessarily racist to ""prefer"" whites to blacks in the sense of preferring a lighter skin rather than a darker one. This is probably only applicable in real life to sexual preferences; in sexuality there are people who prefer whites and some who prefer blacks or Asians. It has been suggested that even in societies where outright racism is taboo (even in those which have egalitarian attitudes) an aversive racism still exists subconsciously due to herd mentality. However, there are some things that shouldn't be influenced by ethnicity, such as judgment of character or attributes."" Why ""should"" racial preferences have to be involved in sexuality? What my opponent is saying here is that there is MERIT in these racial preferences, otherwise they would be inconsequential to my opponent's argument. The question, then, is what merit? My opponent also seems to be justifying racism with the fact that it exists subconsciously in some parts of the world. My opponent says that there are ""some things that shouldn't be influenced by ethnicity,"" presumably referring to human judgements, but why should ANYTHING of a person's character or mind be judged by ethnicity? My opponent here attempts to justify racism, but as my opponent himself has conceded racism (or ""ethnic hatred"") is apparently one of the main causes of the various conflicts I have mentioned! ""Nations are the same way. I might prefer my American custom of walking inside homes with shoes, while the Japanese find it disrespectful. I am happy with my native language of English, but that doesn't make it superior to other languages. The idea of saying that American customs or culture are objectively superior to others is actually taboo in American society. But why must it be BETTER for you to prefer your own American custom of walking inside homes with shoes? Or to prefer English to Japanese if you know both? ""it is entirely possible that an influx of Mexicans into New Mexico or Arizona may culturally and ethnically shift those regions and make them to view themselves as ""Mexican"" and see the USA as a foreign occupier. A movement for liberation might change the political boundaries of the region."" My opponent is once more descending into two dimensional, them - and - us thinking, and interestingly it may be used against him from the other side - what if the Mexicans who immigrated to the US were not patriots, and thus saw no reason to change the border? Would that not be an argument against patriotism? But going back to my earlier point concerning the US, it is precisely the patriotic paranoia that says that fences must be built to stop a minor influx of immigrants from entering the country that causes conflicts like the wars between Mexico and the US in the 1800s - and my question is this, if my opponent believes that immigration is bad, does he support the American settlers who originally settled in Mexican lands (in the 1800s) and then claimed that they should be part of the US? And more importantly, why are they more justified in living in Arizona than the Mexicans who originally conquered it, or going back further, the First Nations who lived on it originally? ""This is also seen in the disputed region of Northern Ireland. It makes sense that it should be a part of Eire, but the dominant culture there is Scottish rather than Irish. It is inconceivable to view this as illogical because each person belongs to his or her ethnic or cultural group. It's a part of human nature."" The conflict in northern Ireland is more of a religious nature than an ethnic one, but once more my opponent makes a basic assumption - that somehow an individual must ""belong"" to a certain ethnic or cultural group, rather than be an individual. Counterculture and such have long disproven this concept. Also, in this example opponent has confused the cause with the result - surely it is patriotism towards Eire that has caused the northern Irish to want to secede? Surely it is patriotism to Britain that causes the northern Scots - Irish to want to remain part of Britain - otherwise, there would be no ethnic conflict, as there is none in other parts of the world where different ethnic groups are capable of thriving alongside one another. India is a perfect example of how different cultures are capable or coalescing peacefully. ""In the case of Rome, the imperial ethnicity was Italian. While non-Romans may have been granted citizenship, they were simply part of the state and not actually considered true-blooded ""Romans."" My opponent confuses my previous statement, that a non - Italian would certainly be capable of being patriotic towards Rome and even committing mass slaughter in her name - with ethnic distinction. What my opponent seems to be saying here is that patriotism now only concerns one's own cultural and ethnic group, and the state is not involved at all, which completely undermines the original definition of the term! Therefore what my opponent is really saying is that patriotism works if you're personal identity, ethnicity, and language coalesces directly with everyone else in the state, and that otherwise (as, according to my opponent, in Rome) it is meaningless. Since nobody is exactly the same as everyone else, my opponent is basically claiming that patriotism is meaningless. ""But murder would inevitably happen, and hereditary monarchies eventually result in abuse and ignorance."" I can now use the same argument my opponent used against me, to similar effect. How do you know that murde would inevitably happen? Just as in terms of patriotism, one cannot be sure that racism would invariably happen. The same goes (and even more significantly) for hereditary monarchies. The country of Jordan is a perfect example of how hereditary monarchies do not necessarily invariably end in abuse and ignorance. ""That is not what I am suggesting at all. My point was that since ideological differences caused the problems, they do not require patriotism to exist."" Ideological differences caused the massacres of North American aboriginals? Of the Gauls? ""I could support my country without believing that it was justified in all of its wars or actions."" But what if it was not justified in any? ""I was specifically referring to ethical or political ideologies (rather than patriotism)."" Patriotism is ethical, otherwise we wouldn't be debating it! ""Ethnicity vs. Nation"" How can you be patriotic towards a country you weren't even born in? And what if you happened to prefer some of Dutch culture, but have no Dutch ancestry. Should you be a Dutch patriot then?"	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

Racial quotas don’t develop new players	The quota system could lead to moving players from the regional teams who generally have less non-white players pilfering them from other unions, rather “Home growing” them[1]. Former Springboks coach Peter de Villiers, the first non-white person in that role, has described quotas as a “waste of time[2]”.

57	S9f3db814-A16ab7ce8	1	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action should be based on Socio-Economic Status and not race or religion	AA is centralized around race instead of the core of the problem: SES (Socioeconomic Status) . AA focuses too much on the race and not the reason why the race is in trouble: their SES. Asians prove this because although they were once very low in SES, they have risen above that and have gained high SES. Now, not only are they not considered disadvantaged, but they are considered a ‘model minority'. People with black sounding names, as I have previously stated, are less likely to get jobs because Black American's generally low SES gives them a poor steryotype. People with low SES typically are less industrious, less responsible, dress and speak poorly, and are not good employees. Because of Black peoples generally low SES they typically are faced with moderate to intense prejudace. Asians were historically faced with the same problem. However, they are now a 'model minority' due to their generally high SES. Asians with asian names, such as Jin Woo or Hei Lun Kim, do not face the same prejudice due to their high SES. AA strikes at a branch of the problem instead of cutting the roots of prejudice, like SAA (Socioeconomic AA) does. If AA is put in place minorities in high positions will still be discriminated against because 'they only got there due to 'reverse racism'. However, SAA cuts down the roots, not the branches, of minority discrimination, which will kill it forever. My opponent sugjests that AA will create diversity by bringing minorities into higher SES in a way SAA could not. AA will in fact bring diversity, but only when color is the first and foremost concern on a society's mind. The 'many talents of people from different cultures, perspectives, abilities and disabilities' my opponent is so concerned about stem not from the color of your skin, but by the enviorment you've grown up in. This has been proven by psycology for decades (http://www-personal.umich.edu...). A black man born into wealth will think similarly ,have similar talents, and have a similar culturewith other black, white, asian, and hispanic men born into similar circumstances. The same is true with a white man born into poverty. He will think similarly, have similar talents, and live in a similar culture with other white, black, asian, and hispanic men born into poverty. Voting reflects this, as voting reflects the way an individual thinks. My opponent has agreed that ' social conditions create an individual's thought - not the color of his skin. He notes that people vote not based on race, but on social environment. That's generally true'. It is generally true because there are always exceptions. SAA will give those in low SES to not only express their talents, ideas, and beleifs, but will be able to put them into action. Due to a lack of power and money, those with low SES rarely are able to do this. However, to be able to do this they will need help in aquiring the nessisary abilities and skills to rise to the top. SAA is able to do this. AA, with all due respect to my opponent, only makes sense in a color oreinted world. My opponent beleives that AA will help needy whites as well as minority races. By definition it cannot. It was created to give disadvantaged minorites the advantage over those ethnic and religous groups generally in less need (http://www.archives.gov...) Because it steryotypes to such an extent it cannot help races that steryotypically do not steryotypically need help. The impoverished white male prodestant cannot, by definition, be helped by AA. However, the wealthy black muslim woman can be helped by it. As my opponent has stated ' even though many white groups (or Asian) may have been discriminated against in the past, there is not evidence - or Pro has not presented evidence - that the discrimination from then affects the way the group is viewed in society today.' The reason why this arguement still exists is because people are still racist. Those in favor of AA are not racist in the sense that they beleive minorities are inferior, but that they are so focused on race and religon they cannot see into the individual. Those in favor of AA, with all respect given, are more concerned about a diversity in color than in diversity in ideals, talents, and beleifs. What's worse is they actually beleive that color gives an individual certain ideals, talents, and beleifs. If that's not racism, I don't know what is. (However, they do have good intentions, so this beleif is not immoral, but simply misguided). SAA is concerned about helping those in need and spreading different ideals. It does not matter whether they be white, black, asian, or hispanic. All that matters is who they are. When people are focused on people and not on steryotypes that is when racism will end. AA does none of these. SAA does all of these. It is more inspiring to see an impoverished white male prodestant rise to the top because of all the obsticles he's had to face. The black muslim woman who is wealthy will not have nearly as many obsticles as the first. What is inspiring is that a society is focused on helping and individual in need because he or she is in need and they do not help based on steryotypes. My opponent has also stated the white race will generally not receive as much attention in SAA. This does not matter. What matters is those in need, whether they be white, asian, hispanic, or black, will receive help and guidence. Race does not matter. What matters is if you need help. People of all races do. Finally, if the American people elected Hillary Clinton based on the fact that she is a woman it would send the message that America is still more concerned with sex than on quality and the individual. It would send the message America is still so focused on sex, and perhaps race and religon, that we cannot see the individual. It says we are still a nation very much focused on steryotypes. AA does not stand as a symbol of racism. It stands as a symbol of the continuation of the focous of race. Finally, I would like to end on a quote by Dr. Martin Luther King jr: 'I have a dream that my children will not be judged based on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character'. I would like to add one more thing to Dr. King's dream: that all those who stand in need, whether they be white, black, hispanic, asian, native american, or any race, will receive help they need. I have that dream, Dr. King had that dream, and I hope all America has that dream.	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

More women in the labour market leads to higher GDP	"If there is no equal access to education and training opportunities, this measure does not address gender inequality. On the contrary, gender quotas are likely to bring inefficiencies because companies face sanctions if they do not abide by the legislation. Introducing this legislation on the overall population of the EU rather than simply on matters regarding qualified women will introduce impediments to businesses across sectors. The EU member states uphold gender equality in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Therefore, women do not face particular institutional obstacles to their employment. On the contrary, they have the legal support of the EU law. Moreover, evidence shows the effects of quotas are distortive. In the case of Sweden, the short-term effects of quotas suggest some negative impact on firm returns. The companies had to reorganise their activities to compensate for this consequence.[1] Even in Norway, many firms changed their status (e.g. they moved to other countries) to avoid the sanctions for non-compliance while those who introduced the compromise experienced a relative decline in annual profits over assets associated with the quota.[2] [1] Pande, Rohini & Deanna Ford, “Gender Quotas and Female Leadership: A Review” , Background Paper for the World Development Report on Gender, 2011 [2] Matsa, David, and Amalia Miller.

57	Se149b1f6-A9c630d0c	0	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Racial Profiling Should be Acceptable	I will admit my opponent brings forth a very compelling argument, however when examined beyond face value the premises are invalid, especially when looking to violate the liberty for an entire class of people. “Precedent for the deprivation of Civil Liberties:” It is duly noted that any freedom requires balance, however all the examples my opponent gives“Copyright law, laws against libel and slander, laws against verbal assault, laws against trading government secrets, laws against perjury in court”, are not applicable in this debate. It does establish precedence of instances when person A’s right is rescinded when the actions of person A violates person B’s right. It, however, does not establish precedence to rescind the rights of entire race of people who have not committed any type of violation over the others rights. It is also important to recall that there is no right to security. Security is a duty of government, but is not a right of an individual nor is it included in the Bill of Rights. Therefore, again, there is no precedence of violating the rights of an entire race of peoples for the rights of others. There have been precedence’s where it was deemed acceptable to have minor inconveniences to privacy and search for greater public security, but in all instances it has been enacted fairly and impacted those who have not committed a crime equaly. My main point is simply that while there may be a precedent of suppressing a freedom to an extent for greater security, each instance must be weighed on its individual merits. In that analysis it must be proven to be effective and worth the social and individual costs. In effect any precedence is irrelevant to this debate. “Efficiency and Common Sense:” On face value, and after a slight change to the saying, “if a duck committed the crime, then look for a duck”, makes perfect sense. I don’t dispute that when law enforcement is actively looking for an individual who committed a crime that they should compile a complete profile of the perpetrator including race, gender and any other identifying quality of the person. Visible tattoos and birthmarks are extremely useful to law enforcement to identify an individual when searching as well as skin color, gender, and other visibly identifiably features. It is important to make three distinctions though. First, an individual has committed a crime and this is forcing police to pursuit the individual. In other terms it is not a security operation to protect from a future crime. Secondly, police do not collect only race as an identifier. They collect as much info as possible to ID the perpetrator so they can maximize odds of capture. Lastly, it does not violate the rights of any individual to compile an identifying profile of a suspect, nor does it violate the suspects rights if they color of skin or other ethnic features were used in his capture. Racial profiling fails as a tactic when used as the only or main method to identify who to stop/search . It is absurd to imply that law enforcement should use tactics to stop and search all whites in an X mile radius of a murder site when it appears to be a serial killer. It is not effective. It wastes resources identifying too many false positives, and it violates the individual liberty of many with little benefit. In the case of airport security, which is different as it is a preventative measure, everyone is fairly screened in the same minimal screening manor. In random instances and instances where certain behaviors have been exhibited some individuals receive a more in-depth screening. Random screening is crucial to preventative security in two ways. First the pressure of possibly being caught can cause behavioral changes in a would be criminal. Secondly, it can help stop exploits to inconsistent screening should groups who wish to do us harm learn of the exceptions. In other terms if we stop including ten year olds in advanced screening it can be clearly exploited. The use of racial profiling has serious breakdowns of efficiency as the stereotypes which seeming allow us to target those most likely to commit a crime cause opportunity to exploit. Take the fact that a majority of Muslims are not of Arab ethnicity. In fact the Bali bombers were of South East Asian descent. http://en.wikipedia.org...; Imagine the resources needed to perform a more secure screening of all individuals who appear of Arab descent in airport security while ignoring those of African or South East Asian descent. Not only is it ineffective, it creates a complete hole which can be further exploited and ironically it makes everyone less safe. Racial profiling is not effective. It creates too many areas of exploitation and makes us less safe as a result. When presented with the fact that there are now better methods to screen 100% (x-ray scanners) of air travelers effectively, it makes no sense to violate individual’s liberty simply because they belong to a certain race. The Unintended Consequences of Racial Profiling I believe my opponents intent that he does not condone the abuse of racial profiling. Unfortunately racial profiling can only lead to unintended group psychology which leads to discrimination regardless of intent. It is important to recall that on August 24, 2005 the White House replaced the Director of the Bureau of Justice Department because the employee would not suppress a study which demonstrated that there were significant differences of treatment between the races during a simple traffic stop. While I am not concerned for this purpose about the ethical implications of the White House, the survey shows an inability of the human condition to treat people fairly when segmented in groups. In the survey, all races were stopped by police at a rate of 9%. 3.5% of white drivers had their vehicles searched versus 10.2 % of African Americans and 11.4 % of Hispanics were searched. The report also demonstrated differences on how the individuals were handled while searched noting considerable differences in the use of force or threat of force. The police were more likely to give Hispanics a ticket rather than a warning than white drivers. Interestingly, African Americans and Hispanics who were searched were less likely to have contraband than white drivers who were searched. http://www.nytimes.com... It is extremely alarming that this extreme disparity happens during an age when racial profiling is not allowed. It highlights an important concept in group psychology call in and out group bias. http://en.wikipedia.org... Quite simply it is a concept when people treat others in a biased fashion based on whether they are perceived to be in an in or out group. It is thought to play a major role in the development of xenophobia, discrimination, and other societal ills which impact the quality of life for all. How does this apply to a sanctioned racial profiling program? In short, it would end up as a government sanctioned “out group”. The long term impacts of persistent and government sanctioned “out group” would have subtle but profound implications on the psyche of the country and result in discrimination on all fronts of those in the racial groups being profiled. Racial profiling is not an effective tactic. It comes at an extreme cost of liberty to innocent people to try to catch a few. America should take pride that when individual privacy has been disregarded for the greater good that everyone has been equally involved. As example when law enforcement has mandatory checkpoints for sobriety they check everyone not just who they imagine are most likely to be drunk. No one race should be asked to forgo their rights in the name of national security, especially considering the long term psychological effects of being labeled as, “one of them”.

I will attempt to convince the readers of this. Voting is a democratic process. When voting, a person is letting their voice be heard - their decisions and views are having some impact on the country as a whole. Consider, then, that some people are still racist or sexist. Some people think that a woman cannot run the government, or that only a white man should be in power. Others think that we need something revolutionary to happen, such as a woman or a black man to hold the highest office in this country. While these are perhaps not the most agreeable stances to you or I, they are people's beliefs nonetheless. A person should vote based on their beliefs, whether you agree with those beliefs or not. This isn't a country where you have less of a say if you hold certain beliefs, or at least it shouldn't be. Everyone should vote based on what they think is right, and if race or gender end up changing someone's vote, that's their decision and they should make it. So, in summation: People should vote based on what they believe is best. Some people believe that women and/or blacks need to either be kept from or be given office at all costs. Those people should still vote based on what they believe, regardless of the reasons behind their belief.	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	S16b10a85-A25acb76d	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative action should be ended in college admissions	"Thanks to my opponent for accepting this debate. Affirmative action mainly discriminates against Asians Affirmative action has no effect on getting into the higher education system. The US has a tiered system of higher education so that virtually anyone who wants education after high school will not be denied it based upon academic admissions. There are 1166 two-year community colleges, and “In the United States, community colleges operate under a policy of 'open admission.' That is, anyone with a high school diploma or GED may attend, regardless of prior academic status or college entrance exam scores.” A student successful in a two-year community college can then transfer to a four-year institution. In addition, there are more than 20 four-year schools that take 100% of applicants directly and more than a hundred that take over 90% of applicants; the few rejections are likely for non-academic reasons. [2. http://tinyurl.com... ] Affirmative action is about direct admission to the most competitive (i.e., elite) public schools like the University of California (UC) at Berkeley. [3. http://tinyurl.com... ] Under affirmative action, students of selected groups are admitted despite failure to meet the established academic criteria for admissions. The tiered system in California is typical of the US, with 10 top end University campuses designed to serve the top 12.5% of high school graduates, a larger State college system (23 campuses) designed to admit the top 30% of high school graduates, and 109 community colleges (having open admissions. [4. http://tinyurl.com... In the US as a whole, about half the students in higher education are in open-admission community colleges. Nationwide, elite schools have disproportionately more Asian-Americans than than the general population. California has an Asian population of 14% of the total. When affirmative action was ended, the Asian admissions at UC Berkeley rose from 37% to 48%. In the entire country, Asians are 4.8% of the population; ending affirmative action is expected to increase the population at elite schools from 23% to 32%. All other racial and ethnic population percentages would be reduced as the Asian percentages increase. [5. http://tinyurl.com...] Asians are a small minority and have suffered substantial historical disadvantage, including outright ban on immigration.. Asian immigrants faced language barriers, racial prejudices, and poverty. Japanese Americans were put in confinement camps in World War II. One might think Asians would be beneficiaries of affirmative action. Not so. They are deemed not a “disadvantaged” minority, so along with whites they are targeted for displacement by Blacks and Hispanics in elite schools. Texas, California, and Florida all once had affirmative action for public college admissions. Affirmative action was banned in Texas and California in 1996, and in Florida in 1999. In all three states, ending racial and ethnic preferences increased Asian American representation on college campuses while reducing white, black, and Hispanic populations. Nationwide, a study revealed that Asians must score 140 points higher than whites to gain admissions to elite schools. [6. http://tinyurl.com...]. In the first half of the twentieth century there was a similar “problem” of “too many Jews” in the elite schools, and those schools imposed quotas upon admissions of Jews. Affirmative action remains a politically acceptable cloak for racial discrimination. Affirmative action is unfair It's fair to help people who have suffered substantial disadvantage. Abolishing affirmative action allows applicants to receive special treatment for reasons other than race, gender, or ethnicity. Standardized testing allows poor schools to be objectively identified. Statistics related to crime and poverty allow identification of a poor environment where the applicant has been raised. Individuals can apply based upon their individual circumstances, including poverty, discrimination, and family problems. Another way is to just ask the applicant if he or she has suffered disadvantage, and take his word for it. Accepting the opinion of the applicant alone would be preferable to the arbitrary awarding of benefits solely on account or race or ethnicity. Children of the rich and powerful, receive benefits while poor and disadvantaged people who happen to be Asian or white are at a relative disadvantage. The granting of privileges under affirmative action is violates the principle of equal treatment under the law. Granting benefits based upon race and ethnicity allows any group to demand special treatment. The political discussion then moves away from determining merit or remedying actual disadvantage to one of awarding benefits in return for votes. We should not be debating whether benefits should be given for one's heritage; we should be debating how to best assess merit. It's not possible to award privilege based upon race or ethnicity without accepting that such privilege is sometimes justified. The only way to uphold equality is to outlaw unwarranted privilege. Affirmative action diminishes society and the economy Society works best and is most competitive in the world economy when it turns out the best of each profession: scientists, physicians, teachers, engineers, and all else. The elite schools admitting academically unqualified applicants include medical schools. Affirmative action puts less qualified applicants into the limited number of educational slots available. Granting admission does not grant completion, and the result is what would be expected from admitting less qualified applicants. They drop out or perform less well than the qualified applicants. Society then gets fewer and less qualified professionals. When affirmative action is ended, graduation rates increase. The way the tiered system works, if a student is denied admission at top school like Berkeley he will always be admitted to a less competitive level of the system. Both admissions and graduation rates for Blacks and Hispanics increased after California ended affirmative action. They applied and were accepted into the state college and community college systems, where they appropriately succeed. [7. http://tinyurl.com...] Without affirmative action in California, Blacks and Latinos admissions and graduation rates have been steadily improving. Currently the UC system has 115,000 non-Latino whites and 100,000 whites. … California's community colleges enrolled 513,000 Latinos (up from 255,000 in 1996) and 506,000 whites (down from 519,000 in 1997). … 17% of African Americans who entered UC in 1992 (under affirmative action) graduated in four years; of those who began in 2007, 45% graduated in four years; 71% graduated in six years. Of those who entered in 1994, 57% had graduated in six years. [8. http://tinyurl.com...] The idea that Blacks and Hispanics are perpetually disadvantage is a myth. Under competitive pressure, they do quite well. When affirmative action is banned, schools turn to seeking genuine disadvantage, and that is positive. Affirmative action diminishes the people it is supposed to benefit. Thomas Sowell, an African-American scholar at the Hoover Institute at Stanford, reveals that ""today many Americans will refuse to visit a black physician or dentist because of their assumption that he or she was admitted both to medical school and to the position held through 'special preferences', set-aside quotas, and relaxed standards.

Even with dogs/people of the same general lineage, offspring can inherit good, bad or mixed traits. Also, it is commonly acknowledged with dogs that obsession with breed purity can often make for bad temperament and/or low intelligence as well as genetic mutations due to the genes being too similar to combine successfully. And just look at dogs-- they mix all the time, which only INCREASES variety. It provides for more possibilities rather than making them all the same. If by 'actively against' you did not mean fighting or war, please-- what DID you mean? Also, again, how is that productive? Finally-- Q2) Yes, there are surely some skills that cannot be efficiently repurposed. However, I don't see this as a racial issue. Q3) Of course not all qualities are good. But problems emerge in ALL groups of people. Ideally, as many as possible of these bad traits are bred OUT of the population, but realistically that will never happen. As for binary genetics... not quite. http://en.wikipedia.org...(genetics) As I'm sure you know, there can be full or partial dominance (co-dominance). This depends on the trait, but for example, a white and a red flower may be able to make white, red AND pink flowers. So some traits may be watered down rather than eliminated. And reasons FOR desegregation-- dissipates feelings of superiority or inferiority between groups, allows for pooling of different skills, sharing of ideas, etc., in the context of the US-- you cannot provide the same opportunities, rights, benefits, etc. under segregation. So unless you're proposing we go back and write racial inequality into the nation's founding documents, I cannot possibly see how it could work under the fundamental tenets of the country. One last thing-- about equality, I reject your idea that just because ""perfect"" equality cannot be reached (whether this is between genders, races, etc.) it should not be valued and strove for. Perfect justice is near impossible, but I likewise reject the idea that we should give up on that. You could say perfect health is impossible too (perfect _____ many things are impossible actually), but again, no reason to stop trying. So I guess its up to you how you'd like the rest of this debate to proceed. I'll follow your lead."	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	S2c813efa-A97c94a4	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	The user known as Danielle used dishonest tactics in her same-sex parenting debate.	"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

Racism is normal	I can't dispute that culture shapes empathy as I have argued the importance of studying these cultural (not racial) differences. The study is based on social science and seems to draw very respectable conclusions, though it admits that the reasons for the ethnic-cultural differences are to do with how cultures interact. There is no genetic or racial aspect here. As I have previously stated, it is natural and desirable to scientifically study racial differences. You have provided a study which compares testosterone levels between black and white men and considers the relationship with prostate cancer risk. This is good work. It would be interesting to see a study which looks into testosterone levels among various ethnicities in relation to aggression, but to what end would those findings be useful? Eugenics is a gross path to follow. Cultural critique is fair game. Behavior of others rather than their genetic makeup should be the focus. No good has come of racism, nor will it ever.

57	Sbe4c5eb9-Acb8f74c0	0	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	We should sacrifice the freedom of the individual to pursue equality.	"Hi LoveRichardDawkins, I'm looking forward to the debate. :) First of all, I'd like to dispute the idea that inequality brings immense suffering. Poverty is what brings suffering, not inequality. For example, if I owned my house and had a job that could support my family, but you were ultra-wealthy and had all the same things as me plus a mansion and a private plane, it wouldn't cause me immense suffering. (The worst it could do is make me jealous.) So now the question becomes this: How do we decrease poverty, and ""allow mankind to enjoy the highest standard of living possible and achieve as much as possible""? A good place to start answering this question would be to take a look at the list countries with the highest standard of living on earth. Now, most of these countries are welfare states, meaning they have high taxes and pretty equal institutions, (everyone gets free healthcare and universities are free or cheap, for example), but they maintain a market economy. This means that, necessarily, there are Danish tycoons and rich Swedes that are much more rich than other people in their respective countries. There is still inequality. To get to a point of complete equality we would need to abolish the market. Historically, countries that did this (like the USSR, China, and Cuba) had a much lower quality of life than capitalist countries with a market economy. This is because when you abolish the market, someone has to decide what work everyone will do. This someone is generally the government, which tends to be a LOT less efficient than companies who have to compete with other companies in a free market. The lower material wealth that results from this inefficiency lead to poverty, and therefore to suffering. Plus, when your freedom to choose in what profession you want to work in is taken away, and you're forced to work in something you don't like, that kind of gets in the way of leading a happy and fulfilling life. Pursuing complete equality at the expense of personal liberty only leads to suffering. It's better to give up on the quest for complete equality and look for a healthy balance between equality and liberty."	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

57	Sa18fac12-A83be7f59	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	European Constitutional Monarchies Ought to be Dissolved	"Round 3RebuttalsI would like to start off by mentioning the journalist my opponent quoted. Hamilton Nolan can also be quoted as saying this about the monarchy, (it should be noted that he is talking about all members of the monarchy here, including the elderly Queen and the baby Prince George): ""Confiscate their wealth, sell off their possessions, lock them up for theft, and strike all appropriations for the Royal Family from the public budget. Auction off the crown jewels, use the money to buy gasoline, and burn the queen's home to ground during a grand national celebration."" [1]Apparently, Hamilton Nolan is an advocate of extreme measures, such as arson, against people he disagrees with, no matter how elderly they may be. I would question how far we should follow the advice of somebody who holds such extreme views. Despite this, Hamilton Nolan is also an American. This does not, in itself, mean that he is not entitled to his own opinion about the monarchy, but it does mean that his views will be subject to American ideals, one of those ideals being anti-monarchic. There is a good chance that he would not, on principal, understand the pride that some British people (some not all) have in their monarchy. Thus, the accuracy of his views on the matter are, at the best, questionable. Anyhow, onto my opponents argument, but first I would like to start with a counter quote:[2]""Tourists spend A LOT of cash on Great Britain each and every year! Sure not everything they come to see is royal, but the most expensive stuff is. Americans fly across an ocean to see a land filled with Castles that aren't plastic. Of course they could visit France & Germany who have also had monarchs, but that's exactly why the don't. They HAD monarchs where as the UK HAS monarchs living today in their real castles. The Royal Crests you see across London, on Royal Palaces, Government Departments and even the Guardsmen uniforms are all REAL and embody [the] living and breathing Queen of today.""This quote explains why getting rid of the Royal Family would affect the British tourist industry. If we did not have a REAL monarchy, then what would set us apart from France and Germany, who also HAD a monarchy, but do not any more. I would like to point out a very large flaw in one of my opponents arguments:'For one, how can my opponent possibly know that less tourists will be drawn to the tourist destination if there is no longer a royal family?'I do not claim to know for certain if less tourists will be drawn to monarchical tourist destinations if the royal family is dissolved. However, my opponent also can not know whether or not the dissolution of the monarchy would result in a fall in tourism. However, realistically, it is likely as, despite what my opponent claims when he asserts that there is no connection between a monarchical tourist destination and the royal family itself (a questionable claim that baffles me), the presence of an actual royal family in Britain is likely to incite more people, whom may not have a monarchy in their country, to wish to travel to Britain. This may be due to the fact that the monarchical tourist destinations are, in fact, still used by the Royal Family in some cases (such as the palaces), or it may be due to the fact that there is a slight chance of actually seeing a member of the royal family, which is an opportunity to see the culmination of the British monarchical history which is represented in our Royal Family. After all, the Queen is related to all those Kings and Queens that you read about in the History books.Let's look at my opponents graph (C for him B for us) again: Now, my opponent claims that only two of these countries have a monarchy. This is incorrect. Spain, also has a monarchy, not just UK and Australia, and you can see that Spain has the second highest tourist income in billions of dollars, it is only beaten by the USA, which is a considerably larger country and therefore has a lot more tourist destinations in general, so is likelier to receive a larger income in terms of tourism. This graph does not actually prove anything, however, as there are many factors which may determine the income of a country via tourism, including average cost of attractions and number of attractions, we can not use this graph to assume the popularity of individual attractions, such as monarchical ones, so this does not help our debate a great deal.Role in SocietyMy opponent claims that the monarchy costs the British taxpayer $50 Million, I think as we're talking about the UK we should deal with the British monetary system. Therefore, my opponents new figure on how much the monarchy costs the British yearly is: £30,942,988. He claims that this is largely for travel, which we can see from this graph: is an incorrect claim. When dealing with a larger sum of money than is suggested (£33.3 million) total cost for travel is only £4.5 million. A large amount of the money is actually for property maintenance, payroll and other staff costs. In reality, this sum of money would be necessary with, or without, a monarchy as the payroll would mostly be used to pay the staff who actually maintain the palaces etc. Some staff could be gotten rid of, such as cooks etc. However this would not reduce the payroll costs by a great amount. Thus, around £28.6 million would still have to be paid if the UK dissolved the monarchy, making the actual cost of the monarchy £4.7 million, or $7.5 Million. Thus, if the dissolution of the monarchy saw a £4.7 million loss in the tourist industry, then the UK would have lost, not only a great part of their cultural heritage, but also, they would have lost out economically as well.My opponent also asserts thus:'I will acknowledge that the royal family can do some good, through the work of charity and what not. However, I would like to ask my opponent if they could not do so without getting the lofty titles of Queen, or Prince, or Duke, etc.'If I were to offer my support to a charity, and to clarify I do not have any titles or peerages and I am most certainly not a celebrity, then I may be able to raise a few pounds. However, when the Queen offers her support to a charity, just by the virtue of her being Queen, thousands more follow her lead and wish to support the charity that she represents, that is how she is able to help raise £1.2 Billion for a charity. I'm afraid, no, if she was not a Queen, she could not do anywhere near as much good in terms of charity work. In a perfect world this would not be the case, but the world is not perfect, thus it is the case.Conclusion:In this debate I have shown that the monarchy are a great source of tourism for Britain, as well as being a source of pride for many monarchical countries. Their position as role models to the rest of their country allows them to make great achievements in the name of charity and they can cost as little as £4.7 million a year. They are also great representatives of national culture and heritage, and are generally very popular within the country themselves. [3]'According to polling data from Ipsos Mori, support for a republic was 18% in 1969, 18% in 1993, 19% in 2002 and 18% last year. Three-quarters of the population want Britain to remain a monarchy.' So what would be the point in destroying an institution which is incredibly popular in its country, to satisfy the whims of those who often don't even live in monarchical countries themselves(for example, Hamilton Nolan).Support the peoples choice.

57	S6e8f75cd-A17110209	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Did Martin Luther King Jr impact this nation in a positive way.	I am not saying that I would discriminate based on race if I were to hire an employee. That is not what this debate is about. I believe that the policies that Mr. King shoved down the throats of many Americans did nothing to promote racial harmony. Federal bureaucrats and judges cannot read minds to see if actions are motivated by racism. Therefore, the only way the federal government could ensure an employer was not violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to ensure that the racial composition of a business’s workforce matched the racial composition of a bureaucrat or judge’s defined body of potential employees. Thus, bureaucrats began forcing employers to hire by racial quota. Racial quotas have not contributed to racial harmony or advanced the goal of a color-blind society. Instead, these quotas encouraged racial balkanization, and fostered racial strife. You claim to be a Libertarian but you debate like a Marxist. Do you seriously believe that the Civil Rights Act did anything for economic prosperity? If anything the Civil Rights Act hurt business with scores of burdensome regulations and frivolous lawsuits. Racial equality can not be achieved through government regulation. Equality is earned and there is nothing congress or even the supreme court can do to grant equality with the wave of a pen. I personally believe discrimination based on race or gender is wrong and I bet most people would agree with me on that, but I will fight to the death to preserve property rights and the right to refuse service.

57	Safbe98b8-A824989f5	1	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action is Justifiable and Constitutional	"""My opponent has just freely admitted that it is unjust and discriminatory to favor one race over another"" This is false. The pro made the claim that is wrong to unjustly and indiscriminately favor one race over another. An attempt to equate the act of aiding specific groups in isolated instances in order to right inequities rooted in history with a generalized definition of discrimination is a fallacy and demonstration of faulty logic. The terms unjustly and indiscriminately serve as key terms for understanding what the pro would propose to be the underlying necessities for policies such as affirmative action or at the very least policies that seek the same fundamental goal, which is equality of opportunity. The implication is that by giving more consideration to individuals that find themselves more predisposed to unfavorable conditions either in that moment or prospectively based on a historically observed patterns, then it is justifiable given those conditions. As to the specificity of potential benefitting groups, the pro side will temporarily focus its lens on the African American community. ""To be noted, there is not one law in the United States which actively discriminates against citizens of a certain race or gender"" The absence of discriminatory law does not denote the absence of discriminatory conduct. Even in light of the Civil Rights Act which on paper banned discrimination, there was an adjustment period that is debatably still occurring. While policies historically toted the rhetoric ""separate but equal"" the outcome was everything but equal, perpetuating racial and prejudicial biases that had dire sociological consequences. Affirmative Action was implemented as a countermeasure against subversive discriminatory practices and these practices were not backed by law but rather the result of a socioculturally accepted norms. ""It only takes three things to rise into the middle class. The three things are, ""don""t have children outside of marriage, finish high school, and get a job."" A complete range of social mobility should not be confined to simple movement from the lower class into the middle class, but rather in the definition of a full range of mobility afforded by equality of opportunity that includes access to the upper middle class and even the upper echelons of society. It is the pro""s belief that such degree of mobility is dependent upon education from higher institutions and employment at proportionally equal business entities. This is what Affirmative action seeks to address and remedy. Furthermore, social capital and status are not solely defined by income but a variety of other factors. The percentage of African-American children born out of wedlock is 73% with the percentage of Non-Hispanic Whites at 29%. [1] The graduation rates of black students for the 2011-12 school year was 69% with non-Hispanic whites at 86% nationwide. [2] The unemployment rate of blacks is roughly 1.5 times that of non-Hispanic whites across all age groups according to the United States Department of Labor for the 2nd Quarter of 2018 [3] Now these statistics and the factors that influence them cannot be fully divorced from the exercise of individual responsibility nor should they be. Conversely, they cannot be analyzed holistically without acknowledgement of historical and sociocultural factors. While Affirmative Action certainly cannot exclusively remedy the difference, it can be a mechanism to aid in that process, when correctly executed. ""If the individuals are assumed to be qualified, I see no reason for Affirmative Action"" Again, Affirmative Action was originally created on the premises that despite qualification, many minority groups were denied acceptance into specific institutions based on race. It was not meant to retaliate against majority groups but to equalize the established system that originally supported majority groups at the expense of minorities. ""If the individuals are assumed to be qualified, I see no reason for Affirmative Action"" ""The problem is that Affirmative Action usually lowers the standards for certain races and sexes."" Hence the pro""s inclusion of the qualifiers unjustly and indiscriminately in it""s original statement. The pro agrees that the standards should not be lowered below a set of parameters nor should quotas be imposed for the mere sake of diversity. However, in most evaluative practices it is not a single immutable bar that determines applicant competence, but rather several sets of parameters (many being arbitrary and unquantifiable) of which an applicant can meet, exceed or even fall short in light of other factors (for example a student may gain entry into a University with a GPA lower than the average if a standardized test score significantly higher than the average, intellectual capacity demonstrated through essay based questions that may outweigh other measurable factors, or other character based traits that are implied through extracurricular activities and the like.) To reemphasize, It is not the Pro""s argument that Affirmative Action should lower the standard or use either race or whatever other identity based trait as a singular trump-all factor, but rather that in order to equalize opportunity and control for potential bias (both conscious and unconscious) AA be implemented, and by extension take into account the various extenuating factors surrounding an applicant and their application and to neglect to do so would wholly dismissed certain historical and sociocultural factors. The notion that ""Affirmative Action believes that these races and sexes cannot reach the standards the free market sets for every other race and sex"" is an assumption made on the premise that society is collectively blind to race and/or gender and thus starts everyone on equal footing which is observed to be historically and currently inaccurate in light of the aforementioned statistics. While a certain degree of inequity is to be expected across and within different race groups for factors seemingly independent of race, if those same inequities can be traced back to several specific statistics that specifically vary across race groups in a disproportionate fashion as a foundation for what would hinder social mobility (and under the assumption that there are no biological factors that would support such a large disparity) then it stands to reason that there are sociocultural mechanisms that would lead to the existence of said disparities which would result in the necessity of the implementation of policies such as affirmative action making them justifiable and constitutional."

57	Sc69eced2-Aba24d70e	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action	I would again like to thank Kescarte for the opportunity to debate this topic. Con’s Case: No Evidence and Half Truth Argumentation It seems that con’s arguments are based on what-if scenarios and are not backed up by any evidence or sources. In, an americanbar.org publication, it is suggested that affirmative action is seen in a negative light because of the way that surveyors pose questions regarding affirmative action, that cause the respondents in these surveys to view affirmative action programs unfavorably. [1] I prefer to focus on the facts about affirmative action, which I will state whileI refute my cons claims. In con’s opening statement where he describes the forms of affirmative action, he states that “they (I’m assuming he is referring to the government) mandate compliance or provide economic incentive.” Both of these claims are inaccurate (nonspecific) or unfounded. After researching this topic, that makes some people uneasy at its implications, I have found evidence that affirmative action programs based on race or gender are nowhere near as prevalent as many people perceive them to be. Affirmative Action: Racial and Gender Mandates in the Workplace Con implies that mandatory Affirmative action programs are formally in place in all employment situations. Formal Affirmative Action Programs, as far as how they relate to the workplace, are only required for companies that meet specific criteria or under certain conditions. This leaves the majority of employers,(including small businesses) with hiring and promotion practices at liberty to hire and promote individuals (as long as they adhere to the EEOC [2]) without specific quotas or formal regulation. Under Executive Order 11246, OFCCP administers and enforces regulations which prohibit federal contractors and federally-assisted construction contractors and subcontractors, who do over $10,000 in Government business in one year from discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Executive Order also requires Government contractors to take affirmative action to insure that equal opportunity is provided in all aspects of their employment. Each Government contractor with 50 or more employees and $50,000 or more in government contracts is required to develop a written affirmative action program (AAP) for each of its establishments. [3] Courts may require employers to adopt affirmative action programs as a remedy for past discrimination under Title VII. [4] Taking these factors into consideration, affirmative action, by law, isn’t affecting most employers in the US. The employers that formal affirmative action programs are effecting through government mandates, are companies that get much of their business from the government themselves, therefore affirmative action programs are warranted to ensure that these companies are hiring and promoting those who could be at a disadvantage without these mandates. The history and continuance of discrimination within labor unions of the construction trade, is one of the reasons that affirmative action programs are needed for companies that receive government contracts. [5] Affirmative Action: Economic Incentives I could not find any evidence that economic incentives are given to companies to employ or promote individuals based on race or gender; what I did find was evidence that companies can receive economic incentives for employing those with disabilities [6][7](including those deemed economically disadvantaged who had previously received economic government assistance) or Military Veterans who were unemployed. [8] Cons argument is based on what if scenarios that don’t exist in reality. There are no economic incentives given by the US Government to hire minorities or women, only economic incentives to hire the disabled, economically disadvantaged, or unemployed veterans. Affirmative Action: Supply and Demand Con makes the claim that supply and demand should dictate the hiring and promotional practices of employers. Many employers chose to implement affirmative action programs within their hiring and promotion practices. It is still “affirmative action” whether it is mandated by the government, or practiced voluntarily. “The majority of corporate affirmative action programs are voluntary attempts to improve workforce diversity.” Many corporations voluntarily engage in affirmative action practices because diversity of the workforce is desirable. Problem solving that requires more than one approach or perspective improves with the creative solutions offered by a diverse workforce. [1] “Strong corporate support for affirmative action programs makes it likely that such programs will persist, even in the absence of government support.” [1] In a free market capitalistic society, private companies themselves are finding that hiring a more diverse workforce, including minorities, women, and those with disabilities offers an advantage in the manufacture and market of their products or services. If companies are choosing to implement their own affirmative actions policies, without being required by law to do so, then affirmative action must hold benefits to companies themselves, and not just to the individuals who benefit from these policies. Affirmative Action is beneficial to more than just minorities, women, or individuals with disabilities, as the perspectives they bring to the workforce offer innovative ideas to solving problems that may have never been thought of in a work setting where everyone came from similar perspectives in life.

This is probably only applicable in real life to sexual preferences; in sexuality there are people who prefer whites and some who prefer blacks or Asians. It has been suggested that even in societies where outright racism is taboo (even in those which have egalitarian attitudes) an aversive racism still exists subconsciously due to herd mentality. However, there are some things that shouldn't be influenced by ethnicity, such as judgment of character or attributes.Nations are the same way. I might prefer my American custom of walking inside homes with shoes, while the Japanese find it disrespectful. I am happy with my native language of English, but that doesn't make it superior to other languages. The idea of saying that American customs or culture are objectively superior to others is actually taboo in American society.""Are there not paranoid Republicans who want to build a border fence with Mexico? Are there not stories of ""boat people"" being sent away from Australia with no supplies and starving in the process?""Cultural assimiliation or demographic threat are very real possibilities. I'm not sure about Australia, but it is entirely possible that an influx of Mexicans into New Mexico or Arizona (which are already influenced by them, with Spanish being taught almost as a second language) may culturally and ethnically shift those regions and make them to view themselves as ""Mexican"" and see the USA as a foreign occupier. A movement for liberation might change the political boundaries of the region.This is also seen in the disputed region of Northern Ireland. It makes sense that it should be a part of Ireland proper, but the dominant culture there is Scottish rather than Irish. It is inconcievable to view this as illogical because each person belongs to his or her ethnic or cultural group. It's an essential part of human nature.""Rome was certainly not defined by ethnicity - anyone could become a part of the Roman Empire (and later a full Roman citizen) and many did.""""An empire is a state with politico-military dominion of populations who are culturally and ethnically distinct from the imperial ethnic group and its culture"" [1. http://en.wikipedia.org...]. In other words, the ruling ethnicity controlled all of the other cultures comprising the empire. In the case of Rome, the imperial ethnicity was Italian. While non-Romans may have been granted citizenship, they were simply part of the state and not actually considered true-blooded ""Romans.""For instance, a Numidian who had full citizenship might be treated equally under the law, but he would still be seen as a Numidian. We can understand this even today. A person of Japanese descent, who speaks only Japanese and understands only Japanese customs is not considered a Frenchman, even if he lives in France and has full citizenship.---> P A T R I O T I S M - D O E S - N O T - N E C E S S I T A T E - A B S O L U T I S M. <---""By this definition we should repeal all laws.

If we could, say, genetically engineer a more peaceful breed of humans (or simply educate this one out of ignorance) than perhaps such laws wouldn't even be necessary. If there was a some method that could maintaining the honesty and stability of a hereditary monarchy- then why not have one? I argue that if humans become peaceful or enlightened enough to avoid racism or war, then patriotism is most certainly justifiable. We are already on the path to this ""enlightenment,"" seeing as racism is disappearing and war isn't a way of life anymore in most developed countries.""My opponent concedes here that ""patriotism was used as a weapon"" which goes back to what I mentioned earlier - that the idea in itself is capable of inciting to violence. If not, then why was it used?""Yes, the idea could incite violence, but the examples you cited were caused by ideological differences rather than patriotism itself.""It is ludicrous to suggest that something must happen all the time or none of the time and that there is no in - between. Why do we have constitutions if democracy does not inevitably lead to chaos?""That is not what I am suggesting at all. My point was that since ideological differences caused the problems, they do not require patriotism to exist. Patriotism can exist by itself without violence or ignorance, which mainly occurs under authoritarian regimes or with extreme nationalism.""If my opponent agrees with my statement that it is not always right to stand with one's country, then was it patriotic, for example, to be on the Soviet side in the cold war if one believes that it would benefit America to be Soviet controlled?""I'm not sure I understand the question. I could support my country without believing that it was justified in all of its wars or actions. Even more Conservatives, who are sterotyped as mindless patriots, are starting to oppose the war in Iraq [2. http://articles.cnn.com...].""Is patriotism not an ideology?""I was specifically referring to ethical or political ideologies. These can be influenced by culture, but again, many people ignore traditional conceptions of them and support others.""Should you be patriotic to France because it is where you were born, or Belgium because it is where you grew up?""You would have to weigh your ethnicity against your culture.

57	S3ed53d2-A5fbe897d	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	On balance, affirmative action in the United States is desirable	"Thank you, FourTrouble. I will present rebuttals in the following round. For now, I will construct my own case. Negation Case: Premise: The cost of affirmative-action Costs, according to the Center for the Study of American Business [8]: $6.5 billion to the private sector in Affirmative-action grievances alone $1.7 billion to Federal agencies to enforce affirmative-action $21.4 billion to the private sector in total compliance costs Further cost resides in the form of ‘opportunity cost’, of which Brimelow and Spencer, cited in the Helen Suzman Foundation, found to be a staggering $236 billion, all in one year alone [6]. This opportunity cost refers to the revenue lost, due to the increased drop-out and lower-capability facets of affirmative-action students, when compared to non-affirmative-action students. It is Pro’s requirement that justification be provided for these exorbitant expenses. In my Negation Arguments, I will make use of these realities. Negation Arguments: Arguments in relation to minority affirmative-action recipients (i.e. African-Americans, Hispanics etc.) Link 1: Affirmative-action hurts minorities According to the Stanford Alumni (quoting Herrnstein and Murray’s, The Bell Curve), there is a substantial, average gap between African-American and White accepted applicants of 171 SAT points [1]. In terms of university admission, this can translate into statistics such as the ones found at Princeton University, wherein if affirmative-action were to be abolished, the 33.7 acceptance rate for African-Americans would fall to 12.2 percent. Incidently, the Hispanic acceptance rate would fall from 26.8 percent to 12.9 [2]. Furthermore, within the same source, with affirmative-action abolished, minority student admittance to the University of Berkeley Boalt Hall Law School plummeted 66 per cent from the previous year’s figures. Evidently, affirmative-action promotes unfit minority candidates *well above* their recorded ability level. These conclusions are supported by Sander’s research, of which comes from the UCLA law school where Sander works at: minority students were exceedingly representative of the bottom ten percent of the class – only one in four passed [3]. Therefore, due to this mismatch in ability-level, is should be of no surprise that in Sander and Taylor’s Mismatch, referenced in The Daily Beast, it is argued that minority students are disadvantaged by [3]: Being less prepared for classwork, and therefore much more likely to drop-out anyway Being more likely to flunk the professional certifications required to make-use of their degree Evidently, working at *well above* ability-level causes great stress, anxiety and failure in minority groups (indicated by racial-minority students having the lowest confidence-rates in themselves [14]), of which, due to the inflated perception of their ability, are seemingly unable to remedy. Vicious circle: Furthermore, minorities experience self-doubt and self-esteem issues, according to a report by David Dodenhoff. Thus, affirmative-action students tend to prefer “easier” majors and drop-out of school at much higher rates, as corroborated with Stanford’s and Sander’s statistics. However, the issue never ceases as due to the selection of easier majors and higher drop-out rates, stereotypes are reinforced, which leads to, you guessed it: selection of easier majors and higher drop-out rates [4]. In fact, a paper by Antonovics and Sander [7] found that *without* affirmative-action, minority students are *more likely* to accept offers from universities, due to a release from this vicious circle. Thanks to affirmative-action, this vicious spiral continues to lower self-esteem and increase self-doubt amongst minority students as a collective. Affirmative action incites entitlement (which creates unhappiness): However, despite receiving preference, affirmative-action does not satisfy even those who it is meant to help but instead sparks racial tension *in those whom benefit*. From an official Gallup Poll, it was recorded that, “three in four blacks believe that they do not have equal job opportunities in [America]” [5]. Link 2: Affirmative-action hurts high-performing students, and leads to racial violence Asian people, since affirmative-action largely benefits Hispanic and Black people, are negatively affected by this discrimination (which, ironically, is designed to curb discrimination). In a Princeton University report, citing figures for the University of Berkeley Boalt Hall Law School, Asian admittance rates drop from 23 percent to 18 percent, if affirmative-action were used. These percentages are based on a sample-size of 45,000 Ivory League applicants, which is an enormous sample-size [2]. Discrimination breeds racial tension: From this, the impact is that Asians feel discriminated against and have less faith in the system. As David Dodenhoff suggests in his report: “[blacks, whites, Asians and all other racial groups] begin to resent the individuals and groups they perceive to benefit from such policies” [4]. Fostering deleterious division, as affirmative-action does, leads to tension amongst racial groups, of which can cause racial crime. Indeed, as a Gallup Poll suggested, whilst 72% of African Americans support affirmative-action, 49% of White Americans *opposed* affirmative-action [5]. A poll by the Pew Research Center corroborated this view: “62% of Americans disagreed with the statement that we should give ""preferential treatment"" to minorities, while only 33% agreed” [15]. Racial tension divides communities: In Frank Salter’s novel, On genetic interests: family, ethny, and humanity in an age of mass migration, he argues, “Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism” [16]. As racial tension strikes a community, as it becomes less homogeneous, it becomes less caring, less friendly and less stable, making it a worse place to live in. Racial tension leads to violence: Especially since affirmative action leads entitlement, (“three in four blacks believe that they do not have equal job opportunities in [America]” [5]), it is no surprise that when entitlements are not met, minorities lose faith in the system, and racial violence erupts. An example includes, but are not limited to, the 2015 Baltimore Riots, wherein 20 police officers were injured, 285-350 businesses damaged, 150 vehicle fires and 60 structure fires, to name a few of the scary results [17]. Racial violence means serious community divides, terror and wasted governmental money (to mend the destruction). Arguments in relation to non-minority affirmative-action recipients (i.e. women) Link 3: Affirmative-action encourages women into jobs they have little interest in Women are naturally interested in people-orientated professions: From an enormous sample-size of 200,000 from over 52 countries, Richard Lippa found that, “Men are much more orientated to the ‘thing-orientated’ occupations [(i.e. science, engineering etc.)]. Women, relatively, are much more orientated towards the people professions” [9]. Further, damning corroboration is found in the documentary, Brainwash, in the words of Trond Diseth of Oslo Univerisity. Trond, who works with, “children with deformed genitals”, can determine (with near 100% accuracy) biological sex in recently-birthed children, merely by observing which toy the child gravitates to [10, time: 17:26]. Evidently, women have a *biological* preference towards people and people-orientated professions. Attempting to stymie women’s biological interests is expensive: Programs and organisations that push women towards certain professions, such as the ‘Steminist’ organisation, arouse sexist policies, such as ‘gender quotas’ so that there is a push towards ‘gender equality’ in the workforce. As cited earlier in my premise, the costs could hardly be seen to be worth pushing women into jobs they are not really interested in. Men are heavily discriminated against: The other impact is this. Gender quotas, backed by U.S. President Barrack Obama [12], dictate that a certain number of women are *required* to be in STEM fields, or else the colleges whom do not meet these ‘gender quotas’ are reprimanded ($6.5 Billion in affirmative-action grievances alone [8]) [11]. However, a true indication of how heavily men are discriminated against, thanks to affirmative-action, comes in the form of discussions (involving Barrack Obama) about how ‘limiting male enrolment into science fields’ may be necessary, in order to curb, ironically, sexual discrimination [13]. Such blatant misandry results in the unfair treatment of men all over America, of which will be aggravating and depressing for those who realise, and contradicts the intentions of affirmative-action (i.e. this sexism against men does not fight sexism. Rather, it blatantly advocates for it). Summary of Impacts Affirmative-action: - Costs a lot of money (especially in terms of opportunity cost) - Causes high-rates of anxiety, self-esteem issues, unhappiness (due to entitlement) and higher rates of failure, in regards to racial-minorities - Causes racial tension (in both affirmative-action *and* non-affirmative action students), which whilst a bad thing in itself, also leads to racial violence - Wastes money attempting to persuade women to defy their natural inclinations - Is blatantly sexist against men For these reason, I offer you a negation of the resolution.

57	Sc69ec370-A9fe86f25	0	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action	"I would like to thank UltimateSkeptic for presenting his arguments. A. Statistics Demand the Acknowledgement of Discrimination My opponent begins by presenting six statistics that highlight discrimination. However, the first four do not immediately lead to the assumption of discrimination. For all we know, black males could just be a higher crime rate group at no fault of discrimination. However, his final two do indeed demand recognition. First, I will counter the women argument: Women are paid, on average, 77% of what men are paid. However, that statistic does not account for differences in the male and female workforces. One factor is that woman tend to work fewer hours, and part time employees are paid less. ""Just comparing men and women who work 40 hours weekly, without accounting for differences in jobs, training, or time in the labor force, yields a ratio of 87.2 percent, with a smaller pay gap."" Other factors include the choice of college major and years of uninterrupted employment. Even though more women graduate from college than men, they tend to major in lower-paying liberal arts. ""Generally, the more information about women that is included in the analysis, the more of the wage gap that can be explained, and the less is the residual portion attributable to ""discrimination."" An analysis that omits relevant information finds a greater unexplained residual, and concludes that there is more discrimination.""[1] ""Factor in occupation, industry and whether they belong to a union, and they jump to 91%.""[2] That final number does not even include hours worked between the two sexes. Next, onto the racial arguments. I read my opponent's source for clarification, and here is what I found: ""At the same time, it is important to remember that the problems of discrimination cannot be eliminated through enforcement alone. Racial stereotypes, though often exaggerated distortions of reality, are fueled in part by real associations between race, crime, and incarceration. Tackling these social problems at their root""including inadequate schools, neighborhood instability, and a lack of employment opportunities""are likely to represent among the most far-reaching interventions.""[3] It isn't really the fact that employers want to discriminate, it is the unfortunate circumstance of racial stereotypes. Only education to both sides will right this wrong; quotas will only harden distrust and dislike of racial groups by others. Finally, my opponent concludes with a statement on how affirmative action rights these wrongs. However, the best counterargument is Asians. ""An average White employee makes 92.1 percent of what the average Asian makes.""""Average Asians earn $899.5 per week in 2005, which is about 11.2 percent more than other races."" This is even though, ""Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are unique in many aspects. They earn 7.6 percent more than other races even though they work fewer hours, have fewer years of job experience, and lower rate of union membership."" How is this possible? ""Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders lead the rest of the population in educational qualification. On average, Asian and Pacific Islanders have nearly one more year of education. 48.5% of Asians in the U.S. have a Bachelors Degree or more, compared to 31.8% for the national average, 32.3% for White non-Hispanics and just 23.6% for others.""[4] And, in history, Asians have been discriminated against as much or more than any other group.[5] It is education that has clearly been the dominant factor in Asian's rise. B. Affirmative Action and Racism/Prejudice Discrimination Are Not Equals Minorities do not always benefit from affirmative action: ""A high school student with a below average academic record is likely to be a below average college student. Thus, students admitted through minority recruiting programs often end up in remedial classes with mediocre academic performance. Through simple cause and effect, affirmative action programs prolong the stereotype of minority students finishing near the bottom of their class by encouraging enrollment in universities beyond an appropriate level of difficulty. According to a federal study, just 39% of enrolled black students finish their degrees compared to 54% of white students. Attending a university where the pace of learning is too difficult is just as counterproductive as attempting to lift too much weight at the gym. The insistence on relaxed admission standards for minority students insinuates that such students are incapable of succeeding without such programs. This insult casts a permanent doubt on the real achievements of high-achieving minorities.""[6] In addition, ""Supporters of affirmative action made dire predictions about the consequences of it's repeal. A careful study of the data shows that incompetent firms given preferences under affirmative action did go out of business, but that minorities then continued to advance steadily under fair competition. ""Proposition 209 in no way hindered the progress of minorities and women in public employment. Predictions about a future deterioration of labor market positions for women and minorities proved utterly unfounded.""...""In 1999, black students earned a total of 1,139 bachelor""s degrees from the UC. In 2006, that number had increased 3% to 1,170. In 1999, Hispanic students earned a total of 3,984 bachelor""s degrees from the UC. In 2006, that number had increased 33%, for a total of 5,287 degrees.""[7] In fact, The data show that students admitted to the top level schools under affirmative action did not do well. When affirmative action ended in California, minority applicants applied to school suited to their qualifications, and both admissions and graduation rated increased.[7] Affirmative action does not necessarily combat racism or encourage development. C. Affirmative Action Provides Incentive As stated earlier, affirmative action tends to stifle incentives for minorities because it enblazens the idea of the fact that they require a government forced program to get jobs. It carves the idea of stereotypes into their minds. ""Tragically""for blacks, women and other ""oppressed"" minorities""affirmative action indirectly communicates a demoralizing message of inferiority that reinforces the same separatism it set out to solve. It is pure illogic to think that you can fight fire with fire and get anything but scorched earth.""[8] In fact, in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., ""Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority.""[9] Affirmative action completely subordinates the human personality to a person's group. In a sense, affirmative action does not cure disparities among races and genders and discourages incentive and the removal of stereotypes by everyone. It is unnecessary and harmful.

57	S7ef11eef-A792c2dae	2	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative action should not continue	I accept this interesting issue that you have put forward and I ill be arguing in favor of affirmative action 1. What is affirmative action Affirmative action I always see misconstrued in American society. For affirmative action is a multifaceted program that has gone through many revisions due to a changing cultural atmosphere in America. The ultimate goal of affirmative action is to level the playing field that has for so long been skewed in favor of white men. By setting racial quotas for all programs that receive government funding. For instance I am in a government funded program in my school called the STEM program. This special education program received government funding from a program called race to the top and thus must have a student population that accurately reflects the population of my city with in a certain percent error. If this program was only composed of white people it could be inferred that their is a hidden bias in the program and that it must investigated or its funding removed. This is the basic principle behind affirmative action and it has been used and it has proven to be a extremely successful program that has helped desegregate government institutions or anything funded by the government. This helps country the systemic racism that has plagued America since its inception. I would also like to clarify many incorrect statements you made 1.Affirmative action is reverse discrimination No affirmative action is the use of racial quotas to insure that a population of any government funded program accurately reflects the population of the city or state the program is located in 2.Many of is also have grandparents who supported civil rights in the 1960s Firstly try and articulate yourself a little bit better. Secondly just because you don't participate in racism doesn't mean it does not exist and it also means that we should do nothing about it because you or your ancestors did not knowingly perpetuate racism 3.Many of us also have ancestors who worked in the underground rail roads disproportionately few Americans were involved in the underground railroad or any anti-slavery movements 4.Polish people and other white people were sent to nazi camps The discrimination and slavery is very different from systematic genocide and comparing them is incorrect and insulting to the 6 million men, women, and children that died in the Holocaust 5.Your diatribe on the Bosnian civil war Once again slavery and discrimination is not comparable to genocide 6. affirmative action is done to make up for passed injustices like slavery isn't discriminating against the person who actually was a Slave unfair Affirmative action is not limited to black people so this renders your entire argument invalid 7. If you are a bosnian muslim who came here after being raped in a rape camp and loosing your family and you are up against a black person who immigrated from Africa, did not suffer from racism like you and is richer and has had more chances wouldn't taking the black person just because of their race be... Cruel?. once again affirmative action is not limited to African Americans it is racial quotas that ensure that a government funded program is not being racist 8.Most white people don't have slave owning ancestors. Not all black people have slave ancestors or ancestors who were discriminated against here. Yes you are correct but that does not mean that their is not systemic racism that has become a intrinsic yet often unseen part of American life. For the biggest disconnect with your argument is to complain that affirmative action only exists because of past injustices such as slavery. However to hold that view point would imply that racism has disappeared from America which it has most certainly not. 9.70% of white people who came to America between 1607 and 1776 were indentured servants No 70% of the people who came to the Virginia colony were indentured servants which formed less than half of all colonists in America. Thus the reality was that a little more than 25% of American colonists were at any point indentured servants. Also most indentured servants were free after seven years the same could not be said of the black slaves that were later imported. So the two are not comparable in the slightest. 10.Diatribe on Cops and Doctors The medical profession is not affected by affirmative action so that argument is invalid and the lack of trust between police and citizens in Ferguson Missouri should reflect why we need a police force that has a racial ratio similar to the population it is protecting 11.White people are victims of racism Yes but they are disproportionately less likely to be discriminated against Conclusions Affirmative action has been the United States most effective ways of fighting hidden prejudice in America and to remove these safe guards would be detrimental to American society. https://www.aclu.org...

57	Sfe4e664d-Af92d3fdd	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Resolved: Affirmative action should be practiced in college admissions.	"=========================================================================== CONTENTION #1: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROMOTES INEQUALITY: =========================================================================== 1) My opponent's only objection to my contention here is that the example I've given focuses on a single person whereas his concern is the community. In other words, he values utilitarianism. However, in pleading in favor for this value, my opponent has doomed his entire argument: If it is reasonable to ignore the minority and focus on the majority, then I could just as easily turn my opponents argument around and claim that we should ignore minorities and focus on benefiting what is essentially 90% of the US (the Caucasians). Racist and unfair? Sure thing, but it is my opponent who cares little for fairness to even ignore a single person of a different race only to benefit whom he perceives as being the majority. In other words, his argument violates the law of non contradiction. 2) My single example was all that was necessary to demonstrate my point; I only needed to make mention of a single example to prove that affirmative action promotes inequality. Seeing as how my opponent has provided no arguments against the notion that the Barbara Grutter case proves that affirmative action promotes inequality, my job has been done. This is not to suggest that the legal case I cited has been a single isolated incident or else there wouldn't be nearly as much controversy as there is now. Of course, for clarification purposes . . . if opponent IS claiming that there has only been a single case like the one which I've pointed out, I would like for him to say so in the next round so that I my properly address this objection. 3) We need affirmative action because racism is alive and well in America's colleges? As I've pointed out, judges, not only do we have affirmative action at the moment (hence showing it to be pretty ineffective against racism), but as I've further shown, it actually encourages racism. ============================================================================ CONTENTION #2. QUOTAS ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE RACISM ============================================================================ Again, my opponent counters my example merely by pointing out my decision to cite a single case, but as I've pointed out previously, I need only a single example to demonstrate how affirmative action promotes racism. If my opponent acknowledges this, then I've done my job. Of course, if my opponent is insisting that there has merely been a single case, I would like for him to state so directly so that he will not attempt to get around me hitting him with more examples just to pacify his argument. Finally, see what I've said on the matter of utilitarianism and how it actually harms my opponent's case (which favors the minority). As far as the amount of blacks in the universities goes, this is completely irrelevant as the fact of the matter is that even with more minorities, there'd simply be more people who would be inclined to devalue the efforts of minorities based on the fact that they are being given a handout (as even my opponent acknowledges with my citing of the Barbara Grutter case) whereas non minorities need to work their way into universities and often times pay an exceedingly large amount of money (which, incidentally, would show affirmative action to be especially unfair to lower class caucasians). Furthermore, PRO's argument fails on the grounds that more minorities means nothing if they are STILL the minority. ============================================================================ CONTENTION #3. THERE IS A SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ============================================================================ PRO attempts to counter my alternative to affirmative action by pointing out that african Americans would fail on the basis that stereotypes wouldn't hold them down, but as I've pointed out, my system detracts racism severely, thus most of these stereotypes concerning African American individuals would disappear. Of course, PRO brings up an interesting point. In his system, blacks are disadvantaged from the start. If this is the case, then my opponent is actually insisting that affirmative action merely sets most blacks up for failure (after all, if you don't actually have the skills in the first place and are merely being given a handout, you can't really expect an individual to progress further based on nothing). Essentially, this negates his own argument. RE:""Affirmative action needs to be practiced for a longer period of time than it has been so far. If we can get this to work and there is a proportional amount of all ethnicities in universities (for example, if 30% of the nation were blacks, 30% of students in colleges were black) then we can do away with affirmative action."" Even if we were to assume that affirmative action needs to be practiced for a long amount of time in order to insure results, that still doesn't change the fact that not only would my system be effective instantly, but that it would also not bear the problems which affirmative action as (inequality and racism). In short, affirmative action is a waste of valuable time. ""There is a huge net gain. As I said, if we can pull blacks up and have them be on level footing as whites then we will have fewer high school dropouts, more people who successfully graduate from college, and more colleges will spring up, creating a ton of net gain."" In exchange though, for ever black that is given a handout, there are more people (many who have actually earned their positions) who lose positions in colleges as well as jobs. Hence, no net gainl"	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sbe4c5eb9-A78547e40	0	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	We should sacrifice the freedom of the individual to pursue equality.	"You agree with me over that main point and responded saying that we should solve the problem with ""gradual enlightenment of the public"". There you concede the problem: it's ""gradual"". This is not good enough. The injustices that are around today must not be solved gradually. We need real action now. Your solution could work but it relies on a long uncertain period of time. I don't believe is fair to those that are suffering under the current system. I propose a state of action - things like affirmative action and diversity quotas. These quotas do bring about more racial, gender etc. equality.We have to sacrifice the freedom of companies to choose the applicants they want in order to bring about this equality. However, since the undeniable increase in equality we get in the end this is a morally right decision. So we do need to sacrifice freedom to have more racial, gender etc. equality. Next you are guilty of false representation with the example of the kid in a slum. You claim that in order to bring about equality, my model proposes making everyone equally poor as the kid. No - it's a classic conservative fallacy. Rather I propose we redistribute the wealth of a privileged few amongst people like that kid. Therefore yes some people will be worse off but most people will be better off. Of course I don't think we should all be equally poor. We should redistribute. Also even using taxes to set up education and free healthcare would help that kid, giving him equal opportunity. This model infringes upon the liberty of the rich to keep their wealth. Therefore, their liberty must be limited to bring about more equality. My model still works. As for the economy. I reject your suggestion of this ""economic consensus"". What consensus? The only consensus is amongst conservative economists. Keynes, Gray, Michael Albert, Jaroslav Vanek-all respected economists who support more socialisation. Also, a consensus does not mean truth. China is very interesting. You said there is increased inequality-true. But it's still no where near as much as in Anglo-sphere economies like the US and Uk. Also in China there is equal access to education and healthcare unlike in capitalist countries. Even in capitalist economies like the US (the most capitalist in the world) there are levels of socialisation and redistribution. In fact, China only has more inequality because of the free market so by your own admission we need to curtail freedom to get equality. China also grew at such a rate because tariffs on it dropped and the there was an upturn in the world economy. So it's unfair to frame the free market as the sole cause of growth when there are so many other influences. The USSR damaged much more by war than any capitalist economy. So, socialist economies can work. But, capitalism guarantees inequality without government action. My proposal is moral as the lack of suffering and poverty in the end for the many outweighs the limitation of small freedom for the few."

57	Sdd8b63c8-Ac651b2e6	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	The US should abolish affirmative action	IntroductionBecause I believe that it’s time to dispel with the illusion that racism doesn’t exist, and with the illusion that “colorblindness” is the way to fight racism, I negate. Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes, “We ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society. It is this view that works harm, by perpetuating the facile notion that what makes race matter is acknowledging the simple truth that race does matter.” Race matters; vote Con if you want to make it matter less.Advocacy1. Individuals belonging to groups designated as marginalized groups, such as African-Americans, Hispanic individuals, women, low-income individuals, and multiple groups of Asian-Americans, among others, will benefit from affirmative action policies, carried out and sanctioned by the state. The policy will be multi-layered, in that more benefits will be given to individuals who’re a part of more than one of these groups (e.g. a low-income woman gets more benefits than an upper middle-class woman) – this is a change from the current system that I advocate. 2. Examples of affirmative action policies include (a) favoring people from these communities among competing applicants of equal qualification, (b) a reduction in qualification expectations in terms of academic success for members of these communities, and (c) specific educational programs and skill training programs targeted at these individuals. I don’t support quotas. BurdensI’m going to prove that (1) governments have a moral obligation to implement affirmative action policies, and (2) affirmative action policies are beneficial to society. Both of those are independent ways for me to win the debate. For the sake of clarity, I don’t need to argue in favor of all the examples listed above – insofar as I prove that abolishing all affirmative action is a bad idea, vote Con.My Case1. Affirmative action uplifts marginalized individualsSubpoint A: Affirmative action offsets discrimination in hiring/admissions processesThere’s little doubt that racism/sexism are reasonably substantial in hiring and admissions processes. According to a 2004 study by Marianne Bertrand and Senthil Mullainathan, “White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Callbacks are also more responsive to resume quality for White names than for African-American ones.” [1] A 2012 study by Devah Pager and Bruce Western, which used enforcement-based field experiments, concludes, “Blacks are less than half as likely to receive consideration by employers relative to equally qualified Whites across a wide range of low-wage jobs . . . [and] the ultimate distribution of employment opportunities across equally qualified applicants reveals a process of decision-making very much shaped by race.” [2] Moreover, research has consistently shown bias in hiring against women who are mothers when compared to fathers. [3] This direct inequality is offset by affirmative action, which gives qualified individuals a chance to prove their qualifications against injustice and discrimination.Subpoint B: Affirmative action mitigates injustice within workplaces and educational institutions. Discrimination in the status quo is rampant. For one, there is a gap in wages between women and men in the United States, with women being paid about 78 to 80 cents to what every man earns. Adjusted for occupational choices, etc., the OECD estimates that 30% of this occupational wage gap is due to sexism. [4] Pro themselves pointed me to the example of the racial wage gap in the U.S., wherein black men earn 31% less than white men, on average. [5] Furthermore, workplace sexual harassment is rampant and under-addressed, with insufficient rules and reporting mechanisms in multiple workplaces. [6] Affirmative action mitigates these problems because it fights the glass ceiling effect – more individuals have the opportunity to go up the corporate ladder and take on leadership rules, allowing them to control policy. People who benefit from affirmative action are likely to sympathize with issues facing the marginalized and pass useful policy, as a result of their own experiences. According to Alana Semuels of The Atlantic, studies find that “[t]he higher the share of women on corporate boards one year, the more likely the company was to hire women executives in the following year.” [7] Political scientist Michele Swers says, “Women in Congress are just more likely to prioritize issues that have a direct connection to women [such as] violence against women [and] family leave policy.” [8] The same logic should apply in the workplace as well: based on personal experiences, women and minorities are more likely to repeal and fight discriminatory policy. Subpoint C: Affirmative action increases the quality of life of marginalized individuals.Affirmative action combats poverty by providing employment/educational opportunities. Individuals who benefit from affirmative action are more likely to be of low-income backgrounds. For one, affirmative action exists for low-income individuals, according to my advocacy, which means more low-income individuals will have an access to education, for example. Moreover, individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds are likely to be low-income. Affirmative action offers these individuals unique economic opportunities. According to a report by the U.S. Labor Department, affirmative action has helped 5 million minority members and 6 million women move up in the workforce. [9] In South Africa, affirmative action caused a “deep decrease in unemployment and poverty for each population group.” [10] There are at least six million women who wouldn’t have jobs today if not for affirmative action. [14] Affirmative action improves the quality of life of individuals by relieving situations of economic disadvantage. Conclusion. Martin Luther King noted, “If a man is entering the starting line in a race three hundred years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner.” [12] Affirmative action offsets existing discrimination, advancing the lives of the marginalized.2. Affirmative action creates diversityGiven the current homogeneity of workplaces, affirmative action creates diversity. According to Elizabeth Redden of Inside Higher Ed, “The percentage of African American, Hispanic and Native American students admitted to the University of Michigan Law School for next fall fell from 39.6 percent for those students whose applications were considered before enactment of a state law banning race-based preferences in December to 5.5 percent thereafter.” [13] Through affirmative action, the percentage of women increased by 16% of the total number of workers in architecture, 12% in medicine, 19% in law, and 20% in chemistry, among others. [15] Thus, it’s reasonably obvious that workplaces and educational environments gain more ethnic, cultural, and gender diversity.This is beneficial for two reasons. First, diversity has massive economic benefits. When people come from diverse backgrounds, they tend to think of problems in different ways and bring fresh perspective. Professor Rodney Smolla argues that affirmative action “does the institution a favor, enriches the institution, [and] brings to it the positive asset of new perspectives.” [16] Second, diversity facilitates integration of marginalized groups in the long-term, preventing the suppression of their opinions and discrimination within these environments, enriching the institution as a whole.Rebuttal1. Pro argues that affirmative action punishes people who aren’t culpable for oppression. However, affirmative action doesn’t “punish” anyone. It removes disadvantage. African-Americans don’t have the same access to resources that white people have; affirmative action offsets that.2. Affirmative action upholds merit, because, as demonstrated in my first contention, there’s a large number of meritorious candidates who are denied opportunities because of racism and sexism. Affirmative action ensures that people aren’t denied opportunities arbitrarily. Thus, Pro’s own value of merit means you should negate. 3. Freedom is fundamentally suppressed in an environment of injustice. Without access to basic economic opportunities, vulnerable individuals lose basic aspects of their quality of life; thus, their freedom is hurt to a far greater extent than the freedom of individuals who already have certain institutional advantages. If Pro’s value is freedom, you should negate. 4. Pro concedes: “[C]itizens would be forced to pay taxes to fund a police force to protect the right to life.” This means people have their money forcibly taken away from them in order to protect the rights of other individuals. It’s the same reason welfare programs exists. This is in direct contradiction with Pro’s contention, because affirmative action asks people to give up a small amount of resources to protect the rights of other people and to level the playing field. 5. Affirmative action is also reparation for historic injustice. Ta-Nehisi Coates explains that “the payment of reparations would represent America’s maturation out of the childhood myth of its innocence into a wisdom worthy of its founders.” [11] Historic injustice against marginalized individuals means the U.S. ought pay reparations, and affirmative action fulfills this duty.Race matters.

I will respond to some statements made and make my final statement and conclusion. Rebuttals. ‘Those actions are not stereotypes, they are discrimination. You can ban, eradicate and control actions and you can punish people for them, but stereotypes ARE NOT actions.’ ~Stereotypes are actions, whether subtle or indirect, it has influenced your behaviour thus causing an action. ‘We shouldn't be eradicated thoughts or punishing people for them as we should all have the freedom to think what we want. When you act upon those thoughts, that is DISCRIMINATION, NOT STEREOTYPES. Discrimination is wrong and should be eradicated. But the thoughts we have are, in essence, harmless.’ ~I am arguing that a stereotype is an action and is only withheld due to social stigma. ‘Stereotypes possibly should be eradicated to an extent, as far as the negative ones go, but you just cannot eradicate a thought or belief.’ ~Well this is the essence of my argument, I probably wouldn’t have even debated if you had of been this specific, I don’t really understand if you are correcting yourself now, or you are changing your argument, either way, this should have been snuffed out in the rules and round one. Your rules for rounds are stated in round one, it clearly says at round 4 to have rebuttals and no further arguments. ‘Cultures ARE NOT the same as stereotypes. America has come from having slavery and segregation to not having that. That culture changed. But for some, the mindset of blacks being worthless or less than whites, has still carried on.’ ~Cultures create stereotypes. Stereotypes are created from education, this means that a culture is an expression of a stereotype. Conclusion. So far, this debate was mainly opinionated, unfortunately the real debate only went on for 3 rounds, it was a little sloppy on both sides to get started and a little confusing on what we both actually stood for. Pro appeared to be completely for stereotypes, I argued against due to a strong conviction that stereotypes are not useful. The first statement made by Pro was quite vague, It was more of an opinion than an argument and as a result, I returned with a similar outlook, the main argument was ‘Many people want to seem void of stereotypes and judgements so they will go against a gut feeling of danger to trust a person they do not know. Those people will seem like saints to themselves and possibly others until they are betrayed and/or hurt. Stereotypes breed certain fear and caution in people that can help protect them from danger. Without these assumptions, we would fail to place our trust in the right places. The only way stereotyping is harmful is if the stereotyped group is taunted or discriminated against, which is by all means wrong but not the point of this debate. Just to clarify.’ However, what pro forgets to realise is that you can’t have a strong opinion and conviction about someone and not act on it, Pro then used an example of the youtube video which I accurately displayed to be incorrectly used on her* side in round 3. I mentioned that in the video, the police acted on a stereotype and in the heat of the moment, used force according to the stereotype, ending in an un-needed death. Later in that video, the author also described stereotypes to be sustained due to responses of the stereotype. For example, the stereotype of oppressive authority figures in high crime rates of America will only enforce the stereotypes of the criminal figures continuing to apply to crime. Essentially, it’s a belief system. Refer to the youtube video for the source. Later on in this debate, there was also miscommunication of the title; as the title says ‘Stereotypes Cannot and Should Not be Eradicated’, This could be taken in two ways, the first way is ‘Stereotypes can’t be eradicated and should not be eradicated’, the second way is implying the word ‘can’t’ to be an adjective and impress the expression of the word ‘should’ to be louder. I assumed it was meaning #1 I gave and showed a clear example of how stereotypes can be removed. I also mentioned why they should be, showing a bad stereotype. By this time, we have witnessed a clear forfeit in the original argument topic made by Pro; and this should be enough to suggest Con winning. By round 3, Con misinterprets my argument by simply not seeing the complete extent of her original statement. She* also goes on to say ‘Never did I state that ""cultures can't be changed,"" therefore I am not accepting the statements following a proper rebuttal as they are refuting a statement never shared.’ However, clearly this is stated in the title… Shortly after saying this, she then said in her final statement ‘Again, underlying stereotypes cannot and should not be eradicated from our society.’ Unfortunately, so far, nothing I have said needed to be sourced as everything falls under common knowledge or simply a correction of the information already given by Pro, in fact, the only source I actually needed was the youtube video clip that Pro used; At this point I have shown beyond reasonable doubt that I have won this debate by pro essentially agreeing with my points. I do want to thank you for this opportunity to converse with you and would like to possibly debate this issue again with clearer states in which confusion can be kept to a minimum, as in the end, was the reason you lost this debate. ~Kryptic."

57	S621875fb-A33b15c39	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Colleges and universities are justified in considering race in admissions decisions.	A bit disappointed that Pro decided to forfeit, seeing as how the debate was going rather well. In any case, I don't have any new rebuttals to bring up. I've rebutted Pro's entire case in Round 3. Personally, I believe that pursuing equality has two different end goals. One is equality in opportunity, the other is equality in outcome. We often strive towards equality in opportunity, because it is more fair. After all, if people make better use of their opportunities, and reap better rewards, they do deserve to enjoy these rewards compared to those who didn't and chose to slack off instead. This relates to this topic because implementing racial quotas for colleges is effectively guaranteeing equality in outcome, which isn't fair to those who have worked hard and tried to get into colleges. What we can do, that is much fairer, is to guarantee equality in opportunity. By enabling even the poorest of families to have their child study in a decent school with enough resources, we ensure that nobody who is willing to work hard is disadvantaged. Helping the poor should be racially blind, and that, I think, is the best solution to naturally achieving equality in outcome.	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sa3cff50e-Ac27f5e9c	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	There are other policy options that are less distortive and more advantageous for the economy.	Quotas are discriminatory and could be anti-constitutional in countries like France while there are other policy instruments that could be easier to implement. Rather than implementing quotas as a top-down approach, for example, there could be more access to capital and less regulatory obstacles for starting businesses for women. However, women in OECD enterprise account for an average 30% of all entrepreneurs and there are more self-employed or firm-owners. These gender gaps are particularly large in Ireland, Iceland, and Sweden.[1] Entrepreneurs or individuals starting up new firms are crucial to productivity in all countries. In the OECD area, the levels of entrepreneurship are highest in countries showing the fastest growth. The number of women entrepreneurs, as seen in female to male start-up ratios, is also growing fastest in these countries, which include the United States and Canada. Enhanced access to credit and less red tape for women-owned ventures is a promising source of business and job creation without the distortive effects of quotas on business competitiveness. Other non-legislative instruments encouraging gender equality in companies are labels, awards, charter signing, and rankings.[2] They do not require externally imposed structural changes but stimulate companies to commit to gender equality in a manner acceptable to them. Moreover, even if quotas are implemented, they should be flexible and voluntary. A one-size fits all binding quota scheme could easily harm more national economies than it would help. Even by implementing voluntary rather than obligatory quotas in addition to existing national efforts for gender equality, the EU could avoid economic distortions and constitutional complications.

57	S6aa28b86-A6e49284a	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Women in Combat Arms	"Thank you Con. == Rebuttal == Notice that almost all of Con's points contain qualifiers such as ""generally,"" ""most,"" ""traditionally,"" and ""average."" Such language renders Con's argument irrelevant, because I am not talking about the average, general population of women. I am talking about above average - the women with exceptional strength and toughness, as I made very clear in Round 2. So, let's go through Con's argument line by line: 1) ""Men are generally physically superior to women..."" - I agree. But I'm not talking about general trends. I'm talking about exceptional individuals who prove they can exceed the standard. When soldiers are measured on individual merit, it's undeniable that some females will prove physically superior to some males. To believe otherwise would be extremely naive. 2) ""Most males are overwhelming[ly] stronger than their female counterparts"" - Again, I agree. This does not hurt my argument. See above. 3) ""Elite female athletes are barely stronger than your average males"" - EXACTLY! So why shouldn't that elite female be allowed to join the ranks of fighting men? If there is at least one single ""average"" male currently serving in the infantry, why shouldn't an elite female also be allowed to serve? Being barely stronger is still stronger, so wouldn't this be an improvement? 4) ""Male bodies are generally less prone to injury..."" Ok, perhaps that is ""generally"" true. But there are always exceptions. There are female athletes out there who are less injury prone than males. What about them? Once again, for Con's argument to work, he would have to show that not a single female in the human species has more endurance, muscle mass, and bone density than a male soldier. That would be an absurd claim. 5) ""Men can't become pregnant. Mixed units can cause distractions."" The concern of pregnancy is at base a concern about physical conditions that can take a soldier out of the fight. It's true, if a female soldier becomes pregnant overseas, she is immediately sent home and can no longer do her job. BUT - this concern applies to every demographic of soldier - male, female, white, black, gay, straight. Only male soldiers can get prostate cancer- should this exclude them? A black soldier might distract a white soldier - should this exclude blacks? A gay infantryman may be sexually attracted to another infantryman - should this exclude him? It's special pleading so say a female should be excluded because of the potential for pregnancy, but all other demographics are acceptable. A better policy is to simply hold individuals accountable for individual choices. If you choose to drink and drive and get a DUI, the army kicks you out. Yes, this hurts unit readiness, especially if that soldier was in a leadership role, but the organization moves on and continues to function just fine. It's ridiculous to think that removing a pregnant female from a unit would destroy unit cohesion and effectiveness. Soldiers are removed from units all the time, and the military continues to do its job. The ""mixed units cause distractions"" argument is extremely weak. Every demographic has the potential to cause ""distraction."" I'm sure black soldiers were a huge distraction to all-white units in the 1950s. Females caused huge distractions at West Point when it became co-ed in the late 1970s. Gay soldiers undoubtedly cause distraction and discomfort to very culturally conservative soldiers. And yet, none of these cases of ""distraction"" were enough to justify continued segregation and exclusion. In fact, the military is undoubtedly stronger because of the diversification of its ranks. The potential for distraction has never been enough to justify discrimination, and it should not be in this case either. 6) ""Men and women are perceived & treated differently"" - I fail to see the relevance here. Every type of person is perceived differently. Officers are treated differently than enlisted soldiers. Marines are perceived differently than sailors. Fighter pilots are perceived differently than supply clerks. This is not a justification for exclusion. If anything, the difference in perception of men and women probably stems from the fact that women aren't allowed to serve in these roles. Once they integrate, that will help change the perception significantly. 7) ""The mililtary has traditinally been an all male endeavor..."" - again, no relevance here. Before 1950, the military was traditionally a racially segregated endeavor. Before 1980, West Point was traditionally an all male endeavor, and before 1877, an all white male endeavor. Before 2011, the US Military was an all heterosexual endeavor, etc.... All these ""traditions"" changed over time and the military was better for it. None of these integrations caused the military to self destruct. This one is no different. Contention #1 - Con claims integrating females will lead to lower standards, citing the infamous ""Dempsey Rule."" My question would simply be - why would standards need to lower if women are already meeting the current ones? To date, 3 women have passed all MALE standards for US Army Ranger School, and more are sure to follow. It seems then, that these tests are not too difficult for women, and so the Dempsey Rule is defunct. Con suggests quotas of women soldiers will develop, but that has so far not been the case. There are no quotas for how many gay, or black, or hispanic soldiers need to be in infantry units. There's no reason to believe there will be quotas for female soldiers either. Con's cited source talks about raw recruitment quotas for females (this is nothing new btw...), but that is not the same as imposing quotas on females specifically in combat arms. To date, zero female marines have passed the Marine Infantry Officer Course, and so there are currently zero female infantry officers. Doesn't appear to be any quota there... Con's argument here is speculative at best. Contention #2 - Don't run social experiments in the military. First, I would counter that it is not a social experiment if you merely say ""here's the standard. It's the same for everyone. If you meet it, you're in. If you don't, you're out."" That's all I'm advoacting. That's not a sinister feminist experiment, it's equality. Second, I once again point to history - black soldiers were first (officially) integrated into white units during the Korean War. Females first graduated West Point in 1980. Gay soldiers first served openly in 2011. All of these could have been considered ""social experiments."" But that didn't stop them from happening, in fact, it only made the military a stronger and more diverse force. Con says society isn't ready for women to fill male roles, wear male style clothing, or share restrooms. Has Con's head been in the sand over the past 10 years? Society is OVERWHELMINGLY advocating for gender equality, unisex restrooms, ending gender norms, etc... Contention #3 - unit cohesion. I have already discussed this. Just because 2/3 of male marines say they disapprove doesn't mean a thing. That's how our system has always worked - the military obeys civilian authority according to the Constitution. Even if the military disagrees, they are legally bound to obey policies and orders issued by civilian leaders (Congress, Secretary of Defense, President, etc...). That's the oath they take. #4 - standards should be raised. Con seems to believe the military is (or should be) filled with super-athlete Arnold Schwartzenegger types. That's not the case. Google search images of combat soldiers from any historical war. What do you see? They mostly look scrawny, thin, unimpressive. You don't have to be an Olympian to be an effective soldier, you have to be smart, and tough. There are certainly smart and tough females out there who can do the job. If the standard is too high, your military will be very small. The bottom line: Some men can't meet current standards. Some women can. Why then is gender the discriminator, rather than the standard itself?"	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective

"Given Prop hasn't set forth a framework for this debate, I have no choice but to set forth my own.I will thus spread out three points over these two rounds, with more substantative in the final round, given Prop will not have the right of reply.- Quotas are ineffective in terms of actually getting women into parliament- Even if they did work, they'd be ineffective in dealing the actual issue at hand- And furthermore they are mostly a band-aid for a problem and as such they allow the issue to be skirtedFirst, rebuttal.>Women through the ages have been denied, criticised and hurt on the sentimentality of being a woman( A weak Person).truism> But the 21st Century has been a different outbreak for them completely as they have started getting their recognition as being an equal gender.truism>A woman when given power of the whole country tries to reform the country""s orders with her non-aggressive and non-repulsive ability.Right, now here's the issue, around which the rest of the arguments are platudinous - no one will deny that women have been and are oppressed. The central point made by Pro here is that quotas promote reform. I have two key issues with this proposition1.) In parliamentary systems (the only logical application of this ideal) even 50% is not enough to achieve reform given that women are just as diverse as men with regard to their political leaning, and as such consensus on which legislation to enact is impossible - unless you were also to mandate that women followed the same, or close to the same ideology then this move would be largely ineffective.Note: the reason non-parliamentary systems don't work is because it's difficult to impossible to determine what parity in power between men and women would even mean - is a Senator equal to two Representatives? What about a Governor?2.)We haven't seen any evidence of Pro's claim that women will immidiately begin reforming - furthermore, given that Pro hasn't advanced a model beyond ""50% of representatives should be women"" it's logical to assume two things.First, within Pro's understanding of the world it is clear that there are those who would wish to preserve the status quo.Furthermore, those who wish to preserve the status quo are usually those who are representatives of the status quo.This leads us inexorably to a damaging conclusion, which is that women will either be selected to run in races which they have no chance or will be women who will preserve the status quo, which runs counter to Pro's goals.(I'll be kind here and assume that Pro meant candidates, not representatives, given that unseating elected men for unelected women would be both profoundly undemocratic and carry the same issues that I discussed in my earlier point)Quotas are mostly ineffectiveI've discussed above how the method cannot be representatives, given that this simply perpetuates the status quo and as such this means that Pro's model fails to demonstrate real societal change occuring as a direct result and as such the motion must fail.Thank you, and over to Pro. No rebuttal next round as agreed, but I'm not sure I'll need it."	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	S3fb4cb8d-A8c32e5c7	1	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Equality of opportunity by law shall be held to a higher degree than Equality of outcome	"As William F. Buckley, The Father of modern day Conservatism once said in a 1968 televised debate against Gore Vidal, ""Freedom Begets Inequality"" and this is true in every politically driven institution that has ever existed. Freedom and Equality share an antithetical relationship, in which as personal individual freedoms increase, our choices lead us to different spectrums of various fields (In this case, a different income bracket). If a leviathan-like big brother government were to guarantee equality of outcomes at the expense of our individual freedoms, it would inevitably result in a loss of incentive amongst a population typically bent on earning money and bettering their societal status. One must understand that individuals hold varying morals, perspectives and contain different attributes that dictate whether or not they are inept or completely capable of taking up different positions, nobody is subject to their own race. Morally and in terms of practicality, it is more attractive for a society to functionally present its citizens with the promise of equality of opportunity by law rather than equality of outcome by law, and this can be seen in the extremity between a state run economy and one that is almost entirely dependent on the free market. You claim that it is impossible for us to measure equality of opportunity by law without equality of outcome, to which I say is incorrect. Under the constitution of the United States for example, or any constitution of any developed nation for that matter, are clauses and amendments that guarantee the rights and opportunities of each and every one of its citizens regardless of the differing factors that you have mentioned. You provide examples of different situations that include the need to evaluate the ethnicity of a certain group, which begets an argument between the values of individualism vs collectivism. In the case of the exchange student example provided, neither of us would agree that subjectivity within applications to universities on the bias of race, sex, age would constitute for a valid argument against my position of equality of opportunity by law, as if one is to be discriminated against due to his or her uncontrollable attribute, it goes against the conservative agenda of equality regardless of race, religion, condition, etc. The problem with your position is that it relies completely on the idea of collectivization, and the need to reach a proportional amount of numbers based off of a certain criteria that is primarily genetic, while completely neglecting qualifications that anyone has the opportunity of achieving (In your case of hiring). I shall give you a more accurate depiction of the two equalities for which we are discussing. Equality of opportunity completely disregards the need to take into account ones group identity, as it prioritizes ones qualifications and individual abilities, while equality of outcome primarily values groups on the basis of their group identities, seeing how groups are currently ""systematically oppressed"" (in the case of quotas). If 10 students were to be prepared for an exam that took place a week after they were told, in which each student were given equal study material, then regardless of how each student spends their time preparing or the examination results (Most likely nobody would obtain the exact same results) that would be an example of equality of opportunity. Equality of Outcome entails that regardless of your test result, you will achieve a grade mark set entirely by what the school demands, and in accordance to the wealth given to its citizens under purely Communist society's, it would not be a high mark. It is not only morally acceptable to achieve a society that provides equality of opportunity by law, but is also one that proves successful. Do not claim that the left wing supports an ideology that is dominant in terms of ""fairness"" than Conservatives. It is not fair to prioritize ones ethnicity over ones qualifications, nor is it fair to subjugate a race to abuse for atrocities that have taken place hundreds of years ago that are out of the control of the very race you are insulting. I would argue that it is more ""fair"" to determine people on the basis of their individual ability, something they have control over than to determine people on the basis of their group or ethnic identity, something they have no control over. And if you may be confused to why I am bringing race (or any uncontrollable identity) to this debate, it is merely because equality of outcome today determines the outcomes that will ensue depending on the proportion of these very identities."

Those actions are not stereoypes, they are discrimination. You can ban, eradicate and control actions and you can punish people for them, but stereotypes ARE NOT actions. You cannot and should eradicate a belief or thought unless you make someone brain-dead or kill them, which of course the government shouldn't be killing people just for believing something. We shouldn't be eradicated thoughts or punishing people for them as we should all have the freedom to think what we want. When you act upon those thoughts, that is DISCRIMINATION, NOT STEREOTYPES.

Stereotypes possibly should be eradicated to an extent, as far as the negative ones go, but you just cannot eradicate a thought or belief. We can't help what we think of or what we believe in, we haven't learned to control that internally.

57	Se615750-A6f61705d	2	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Resolution: Affirmative action has had a positive effect on society	"Greeting to my opponent and to the audience and many thanks for starting this grand debate. With pleasantries out of the way, let us proceed: PRO begins the the debate by providing three vague reasons as to why affirmative action has not had a positive effect on society. However, even if I were to agree to these reasons, this wouldn't lead us to the conclusion that affirmative action has in fact not had A positive effect on society. ======================================================== AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HAS HAD A POSTIVE EFFECT (My CASE: Part 1) ======================================================== As statistics can indicate( http://www.aclu.org...) , affirmative action has helped in expanding upon diversity and enforcing the opportunity for minorities to be educated without having to worry racial biases forever preventing them from ""moving ahead"" in society and perhaps even grasping the chance to experience the American dream first hand. This would in fact be a (and perhaps the most recognizable) positive effect of affirmative action in our society, hence upholding my side of the resolution (unless my opponent seeks to contest that the above is not in fact positive). Of course, to pacify my opponent . . . I shall go ahead and respond to his 3 reasons for supporting his side of the resolution. ======================================================== PRO's CASE ======================================================== RE: ""1.) Oppresses white males"" What about white females? But in seriousness, my response to this would be ""not really."" After all, this is problem which has more to do with how affirmative action is being implemented rather than affirmative action itself. But just for the heck of it, allow me to cite a positive effect from this method: There has merely been a quota put in place to compensate the minorities. If anything, this actually helps Caucasian males (and females at that ;D ) as they are now given the incentive to work even harder so that they will be guaranteed a position in whatever institution they are seeking to be a part of. This means individuals who are even MORE qualified. RE:""2.) Puts less qualified individuals in positions both in the work place and in schools which degrade prestigious roles and schools"" 2) Again, this is a problem merely attributed to individuals poorly handling affirmative action. Here's a means of getting around it: Give the individuals in the majority more benefits than those in the minority and allow the individuals in the minority to earn these same benefits based on performance. This provides the incentive for these individuals to qualify themselves. RE: ""3.) Allows for a lack of drive in minorities and females"" 3) See above. ======================================================== Problems are not being divined from affirmative; problems are being divined based on how affirmative action is implemented. (MY CASE: Part 2) ======================================================== First, let us define affirmative action: http://www.askoxford.com... DEFINITION: Affirmative action: Favoring those who tend to suffer from discrimination If affirmative action is merely the act of acting in the best interest of those who suffer from discrimination, then I can just as easily provide a form of acting in the best interest of those who are discriminated without relying on the current methods which are used to implement affirmative action. Since this is indeed the case, allow me to present a bullet proof form of affirmative action that doesn't even arguable succumb to the objections of the form of affirmative action which my opponent has. If the government wishes to get involved via affirmative action, it could just as easily simply insure that minorities are not denied on non-academic or work related bases. Let us take college admissions as an example: Students could send their college admissions in, only for their admissions to be transferred to the government. The government would check all facts concerning the students academics and would send these to colleges . . . to which colleges would determine who gets in and who stays out solely based on academics (sports are related top. I'm just insisting that no irrelevant matter be provided). Once the colleges approved of all the satisfactory academic admissions, the government would inform them of the identities of the students they received (in other words, they wouldn't know anything extra about the students until they had already accepted them). Of course, there may be some possible factors which colleges would NEED to know about before measuring all of the potential students' academic records (such as whether or not the students have a criminal record), but nothing concerning race, gender or anything of the sort. Basically though, this isn't a method which would promote inequality or racism. All students would actually be earning their acceptances into college based on their abilities alone. Given that the above method is indeed acting in the best interest of those who are discriminated (in that it is preventing further discrimination against them), this would be considered affirmative action by definition. There is no doubt a similar program could be crafted for careers, granted the program receives a sufficient amount of years and funding for development. In any case, I've proven that the methods which organizations and individuals are using for affirmative action is bad, rather than affirmative action itself. Ergo, arguing that affirmative action has not had a positive effect on society while using contentions based on methodology is using the red herring fallacy, hence is to be an argument which is by no means taken into consideration. And that'll do it for now."	PRO	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sbba2ba62-A14616c89	1	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action is harmful.	"How Does AA Work? As one of the largest employers in the United States, the federal government is in a wonderful position to implement hiring practices that can ignore race, gender, veteran status, religion and national origin – and provide employment and education opportunities to persons that would otherwise be shut out. The Question as to the definition of AA: AA was first created in the US in 1961, under the Kennedy Administration. The idea behind the policy was to use the hiring power of the federal government to promote recruitment and outreach practices that “hire without regard to race, religion and national origin.” [1] The policy was administered under the US Dept. of Labor. All of this appears on the Wiki in the agreed upon definition, and was provided by PRO. It therefore, cannot possibly deviate from this definition. It only deviates from his straw man. “In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson enacted Executive Order 11246 which required government employers to take ""affirmative action"" to hire without regard to race, religion and national origin. In 1967, gender was added to the anti-discrimination list.” [1] AA in the US does not, and cannot by law, impose racial preferences. AA in the United States can only take these things into consideration as means to ensure that they are not the basis for hiring decisions. The policy also cannot protect practices that exclude more qualified candidates. AA Is Misunderstood PRO is not alone in this error, as many Americans believe that AA is a quota system (which is illegal), or that it replaces discrimination with discrimination (which, by actually reading the policy itself, we see is forbidden.) Many also feel certain that AA allows less qualified minorities to hold positions for which they are less qualified. These people are wrong; they have made a mistake, and have trusted sources of information that have proven untrustworthy. I note to readers evaluating this debate that I have used the actual language from the actual policy. I have also included language from the actual executive order that instituted AA. Rebuttals Racism and unfair hiring practices are good, because they build character This is an unsupported assertion, and requires supporting data. I point to the almost total lack of “racism training” in higher education and vocational schools, “Discrimination Offices” in corporations and businesses. “Building character” is a silver lining to an unfortunate situation; it is not a goal. I place a call to value people based on their skills and to leave race, color, religion and national origin out of the question entirely. As we read the actual language of the Executive Order that instituted AA, we see that PRO agrees with its goals. This should be seen as a concession, as it grants my case: that the impact of AA is beneficial. I never claimed that affirmative action leads to unqualified employees being hired, I said that it doesn't lead to the most qualified employee being hired. Noted. However, there is no reason to assume that women and minorities are “less qualified” than their white counterparts. Because companies and academic institutions want to diversify their employees and students they will overlook more qualified applicants in favor of those who meet a racial or gender-based quota. Quotas are illegal in the United States. [2] There is no reason to assume that non-whites or women are less qualified for these positions. This is more obvious in the field of education, race-based scholarships are given out at just about every university in the US, while white students graduating high school with honors get nothing. This is an unsupported assertion, there is no evidence for it. In fact, most college students in the US are white. [3] [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://labor-employment-law.lawyers.com...

57	Sa18fac12-A9fd51acd	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	European Constitutional Monarchies Ought to be Dissolved	"ROUND 2 I would like to thank my opponent, JayConar, for accepting my challenge for this debate. I am sure that it will be certainly highly informative as well as fun. Now on to my opening argument. 1. Economic Strains Presented With Monarchies A major issue presented with the continuation of monarchies, and with it all of their traditions, is that it is extremely expensive to keep up. This is due to the fact that the monarchs and the royal families have an appalling tradition of living in luxury at the expense of their subjects. As Europeans are generally highly motivated to keep tradition alive, seeing that many of the countries have monarchs in office (albeit in a limited role), they are most likely not going to cut any expenses towards keeping the royal families lives in luxury. For example, within the UK this past year the royal family cost taxpayers £35.7 million, which was a £1.9 million increase from 2013 [1]. Graph A shows how this money is being spent within the royal family. Graph A: This shows that there was a large increase in cost towards the maintenance of the royal families property (i.e. castles, palaces, estates, etc.) While I understand that it is important to maintain ones culture, is the restoration of a few castles worth £13.3 million of taxpayers money which could be going towards things that would actually effect them? I obviously think not. If we look at the other numbers, one glaring issue is that travel expenses are at £4.2 million. This is an absurd amount of money for the government to be asking the people for given that all it goes to is making sure that the royal family gets luxurious travel arrangements. This number could easily be reduced to a quarter of the size that it is now. However, I would like to ask my opponent if a reform towards the monarchy is worth it, or if it would be better for the UK to simply remove the royal family [2]. However, this debate is not solely regarding the removal of the British monarchy, as it is also about the remainder of the other European countries that still are afflicted with a Constitutional Monarch. Graph B displays the amount of tax money required to maintain the government in all of the European countries with a monarch, while also displaying Germany's expenses, to compare these countries to one without a monarch. Graph B: Without closer examination, it appears that their is little difference between Germany and the other countries, and that in fact Germany pays more for their government. This is true, however the category that we should be considering is not the overall cost, but the Per Capita cost and Comparison of Tax burden sections. The reason for this is that due to Germany having a very large country it is inevitable that their government will cost more than smaller countries such as Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, etc. This makes it even more surprising that smaller countries like the UK and the Netherlands still pay more for their government than Germany does, therefore implying that the monarchies their are a huge part of their costs. Anyways, returning to the main focus, in the Per Capita cost section, Germany's is lower than all of the other countries with the exception of Spain and Liechtenstein. The reason for the exceptions of Spain and Liechtenstein is that the royal families do not require as much from the people as they generally rely on their own personal fortunes. However, it proves the point that countries with monarchies generally have a higher taxation on their people to maintain the government. To further support this claim, the Comparison of tax burden section shows that once again Germany's is lower than all of the other countries except Spain and Liechtenstein (for the same reason). 2. Lack of Political ImportanceIt is no secret that the kings and queens of Europe are no more than figureheads established so that their respective countries can increase tourism. While some may argue that the monarchs do technically have official duties that they can do, however I would like to ask you if it is at all possible for these apparently insignificant chores to be done by some one else, preferably not of ""noble"" blood? My point here, in its essence, is that the monarchs of Europe have a very limited role in government and that they are in the end a highly unnecessary part of the government in their country. Taking into account the fact that the monarchies cost so much, how does it make any sense to keep them as a part of the government given that they do next to nothing? To clarify this point of view, I would like to create a similar situation. For example, someone has been told that their pet was inevitably going to die within a year. Now they could chose to put the animal down, in the process saving their pet an enormous amount of pain. Or they could chose to keep the animal alive for another year, having to pay an obscene amount of money on medicines to maintain their pets physical state. Logic tells us that the first option makes the most sense here. This is surprisingly a very similar situation to the monarchy issue in Europe. The countries are presented with a dilemma, remove the monarchy and save themselves a boatload of money that could be used on other things or keep the monarchy which will do absolutely nothing for their own well being while taking up huge sums of their money so that they can live in luxury. Similarly to the first scenario, logic tells us that the first option is the better option. To finish off this argument, I would like to quote CNN opinion writer Graham Smith who stated about the British monarchy that ""After 60 years who can quote a famous speech or point to a moment of crisis or celebration when the queen offered leadership and inspiration?"" [3]. While this is in the context of the British Monarchy alone, it can be interpreted similarly for other European countries. In essence, Smith is saying that the age of the Monarch as the inspiring figure to rally behind has ended and therefore their is little purpose of keeping them a part of the government any longer.

Meritocracy	It is a value of sport in general that it should be outside the sphere of social ills like racial, religious and political tensions. Sport should be based on merit only; those who play best get onto the team. Racial quotas will lead to any non-white player in a team in a competition where quotas are being employed to being under a suspicion that they are not good enough and were only selected due to their race. As Peter de Villiers, the first black coach of the Springboks, says “Everybody will believe that these players will be picked because people are looking out for them.”[1] The result could be more racial abuse of players, not less.

57	Safbe98b8-A3cd1452e	1	2	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	Affirmative Action is Justifiable and Constitutional	I would first like to again thank my opponent for this courteous and civil debate. The con would like to begin the next round by stating that one’s color of skin, race, or biological sex should never be the basis for any argument except in regard of certain medical procedures. The con frankly believes that one’s skin color or sex does not matter. This is not to be confused with someone’s culture not mattering because the con believes that one’s culture does indeed matter. Continuing, this is not to say, that if someone is being discriminated against based on these three factors, the general public should ignore the injustice. On the contrary, the con believes that any case of discrimination based on these three factors should be outlawed from this remarkable country. Then, the only way Affirmative Action is justifiable, as my opponent put it, is if there is still “unfavorable conditions” for certain colors or sexes in the United States. Because of this justification, the pro has the burden to prove that such “unfavorable conditions” still exist. What the con argues is that there is no wide spread racism based on those three factors in the current United State and because of this, there is no need for Affirmative Action. The con will unfortunately acknowledge that there are still individuals in the United States who believe that because one is of a certain color, race, or sex, this one individual is less than another color, race, or sex. Beginning, the con will now address the main points made by the pro. “The absence of discriminatory law does not denote the absence of discriminatory conduct.” This statement is true. However, two things contradict the need for Affirmative Action. The first is that there is legislation banning discrimination based on the three factors discussed above. Legislation in the United States is passed by the majority which logically equates that the majority agrees with it. If legislation is passed barring discrimination based on color, race, or sex, which it does in the United States, then the majority has proposed and approved it. This directly contradicts the belief that racism and sexism are rampant in the United States. If racism and sexism were rampant, then the citizens of the United States would have passed new legislation repealing the legislation which bans discrimination. Second, the argument that Affirmative Action is needed because racism is still prevalent does not apply to the current conditions of the United States. The con will contradict the pro’s focus on African-American racism while simultaneously contradicting the focus of any racism in the United States. First, a gallop poll shows that in 1958, 37% of Americans would never vote for a black president (1). Barack Obama, a man of black skin, was elected twice in 2008 and 2012. Second, according to William H. Frye, an expert at the Brookings Institute, “Sociologists have viewed multiracial marriage as a benchmark for the ultimate stage of assimilation of a particular group into society.” (2) In 1958, 16 states banned interracial marriages. Today, interracial marriages have risen to 15% of all new marriages. Continuing, “63% of Americans say it “would be fine” with them if a member of their own family were to marry someone outside their own racial or ethnic group. In 1986…65% said people of different races marrying each other was not acceptable for anyone or themselves (3).” These three statistics alone show that there is no trend of rampant disdain to a specific color, race, or sex in the United States. “It is the pro’s belief that such degree of mobility is dependent upon education from higher institutions and employment at proportionally equal business entities” Affirmative Action is a policy that can be wielded to diminish any race and that is why it is so dangerous. The secondary effects of policy aimed to aid a certain race over another have targeted other ones dramatically. This can happen and has happened in the higher institutions of United States. One such example is in higher education. A National Study of College Experience showed that, “a student who self-identifies as Asian will need 140 SAT points higher than whites, 320 SAT points higher than Hispanics, and 450 SAT points higher than African Americans.” (4). This large of a gap directly shows how Affirmative Action is negatively consequential. The con will concede that some outside factors, such as essays, can influence decisions but, such a large gap of standards, like SAT scores, is blatant racism caused by Affirmative Action policies. “Now these statistics and the factors that influence them cannot be fully divorced from the exercise of individual responsibility nor should they be.” The statistics that the pro utilized never connect to mass racism occurring in the United States. Nor can the pro connect mass racism because, as the con presented earlier, the United States is no longer a racist country. This is because these disparities the pro cited are a causation of a problem in specific culture, not from a majority of people targeting a specific minority. It seems that the pro is shifting its argument to one defending Affirmative Action to an argument alleging that the United States and its citizens are, as a whole, racist. “The pro agrees that the standards should not be lowered below a set of parameters nor should quotas be imposed for the mere sake of diversity.” This is what Affirmative Action does. Affirmative Action “aids” by imposing quotas based on race and when the standards of that quota are not met, unnecessarily lowering the standards for some, not all, races or sexes. If the pro agrees, as the pro did, that no standards be lowered, or quotas be in place, the debate is over. The con has won because the pro is now arguing for something different than Affirmative Action. “if those same inequities can be traced back to several specific statistics that specifically vary across race groups in a disproportionate fashion as a foundation for what would hinder social mobility…then it stands to reason that there are sociocultural mechanisms that would lead to the existence of said disparities which would result in the necessity of the implementation of policies such as affirmative action making them justifiable and constitutional.” The pro makes no constitutional argument throughout the whole pro case. The pro only addresses the constitutional argument in the last sentence of the case. This lack of evidence alone dismisses the pro’s constitutional justification. However, the con believes that even if there was an argument for Affirmative Action based on the Constitution of the United States, it would be faulty. The con believes that the fifteenth and nineteenth amendments actually contradict Affirmative Action. Concluding, the con argues that if there is no mass social antipathy directed to a specific color, race or sex, there is no need for Affirmative Action. The only mass discrimination that is occurring in the United States is caused by the evil system of Affirmative Action.	CON	gender racial quotas effective	gender racial quota effective
57	Sbe4c5eb9-Abc01a144	0	1	Are gender or racial quotas effective?	We should sacrifice the freedom of the individual to pursue equality.	"I'll start where I agree with you - that no one should be treated differently than anyone else because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, sex, or any trait that is irrelevant to the matter they would be discriminated against. Racial and sex discrimination is definitely a problem, but one that will be solved by the gradual enlightenment of the public. It is not a quest towards equality where we must sacrifice freedom. But still you frame problems of poverty as problems of inequality, where inequality is a side effect poverty, but not its cause. Take, for example, the hypothetical kid in a slum you mentioned in your argument. His suffering and poverty could be relieved if he had sufficient prospects in education and healthcare, regardless of the level of wealth in surrounding communities. When you say that inequality is the problem, you are saying (by definition) that if the communities surrounding the slum were poor as well, making him and other communities completely equal, somehow he either wouldn't be poor and therefore wouldn't suffer, or that the suffering from his poverty would magically go away. This is ridiculous. A place where you are completely incorrect is economics - there is a general consensus among economists that free markets are more efficient than planned economies. You say that China has more equality than others, and so seems to be heading in a much better direction. The fact of the matter is, however, that the level of equality in China has gone down considerably after it adopted free market reforms in the 70s. It went from a Gini coefficient of 0.16 in 1978 to 0.474 in 2012!* This is on a scale where 0 is complete equality (what you advocate) and 1 is complete inequality. While this was happening China's economy suddenly started growing at around 10% a year without any other changes happening that could explain it's sudden growth. As for the Soviet Union, it only had a gdp per capita that approached developed capitalist countries (many of whom were also devastated by wars) only in the 80s and 90s, by when it had developed an expansive black market called the ""second economy"" that was essentially just an unregulated market economy. This is strong evidence for the superiority of the free market over planned economy in economic success. As for the moral argument - of course inequality is morally wrong, but so is restricting peoples freedoms, which you would have to do a lot of in order to get complete equality. And the restriction of peoples freedom definitely causes suffering. A perfect example is something that actually happened in some Israeli socialist communities. They wanted the kids to be raised completely equally so they had all of the kids live with and be raised by a small group of educators. This caused immense suffering to the kids and parents who were separated, and the practice was quickly discontinued after they found out kids had PTSD. Sources *https://en.wikipedia.org..."

"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic.

Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially.

I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers.""

Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"

While I do not share his views on this matter, I do appreciate his willingness to put his own opinions up for criticism. I will wrap up this debate by, once again, pointing out the flaws in my opponent's position. Additionally, I will give one last recap of my own argument. =====> A Critique of Witty11's Arguments <===== Contention 1: STDs A. ""Having sex with only your spouse is healthier than having sex with multiple partners."" As stated at numerous other instances, this assertion relies on unfounded assumptions and a false dichotomy. Being unmarried does not guarantee that one will practice unsafe sex with multiple people. Moreover, being married does not prevent one from having sex with other partners. Just ask the Reverend Ted Haggard. Contention 2: Sex and Emotional Health The only thing that is likely to lead to mental and emotional trauma, as far as sex is concerned, is the cognitive dissonance religious people create for themselves by repressing their sexuality. Contention's 3-5: Sex, Pregnancies, and Single Family Households. All of my opponent's last three arguments are based on false assumptions that stem from his personal conceptions about the world and sexuality. Pre marital sex does not guarantee the proliferation of single parent households, and I'm baffled as to why anyone would think this. Consequently, the arguments he has presented in this section can rightfully be disregarded. They are all wholly irrelevant. =====> In Defense of Premarital Sex <====== Contention 1: Sex, in and of itself, is a non-moral activity. Unfortunately, my opponent doesn't seem to realize that the terms ""morally neutral"" and ""non-moral"" can more or less be used interchangeably. However, this point is of little relevance in the larger scheme of things. More importantly, repressing sexual impulses in the absence of reason does not equate to virtuous behavior. No discernable goodness can be produced by arbitrarily limiting sexual relationships to marriage. Therefore, it is simply pointless to say that sex is morally wrong if it is not tied to marriage. ::Conclusion:: Throughout this debate my opponent has presented no reasonable arguments that would properly uphold the resolution. As I have pointed out earlier, even if I were to grant my opponent's primary concerns, then his proposal would still be without merit. Couples that aren't legally married, or are planning to get married, would not encounter any of the fantastic problems my opponent has dreamed up. Consequently, there is no reason to think that the arbitrary boundary of marriage is a sufficient basis from which one can justifiably repress sexual impulses. Indeed, the power of the human mind is an insufficient tool to adequately prop up such an antiquated view of the world."	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	Sa560be9f-Ab3351eb0	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Alan Turing Should Have Chosen Celibacy	Alan Turing was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. His contributions to computer science helped crack the enigma machine the Germans used in their submarines, and helped to push forward the progress of information technology. Unfortunately for the world and for himself Alan Turing was persecuted for being a homosexual, forced to chemically castrate himself, and driven to suicide. That was a horrible. Nobody should ever be persecuted for their sexual orientation, especially not someone who is contributing a great deal to the progress of society. However, such was the reality. Alan Turing knew what would happen if he was found to be involved in same-sex sexual relationships. And he knew that it could stop him from contributing as much as he could to social progress. Alan had a gifted mind, and with gifts come responsibilities. The collective good of British and global society would have been better served had he lived and continued to use his genius to push forward computer science. Who knows what sort of progress we may have made by now? It would have been best for the common good of humanity if he had chosen to live a celibate life. By living a celibate life Alan would've avoided having his career taken from him, and could've advanced progress far more. Even having just decided not to commit suicide would not have been enough for the common good as the chemical castration they forced him under would have still effected his capabilities, and even though he still could've been somewhat of an asset to advancing computer science under those drugs, since people knew he was not only gay but that he had engaged in gay sex they wouldn't have hired him. Is it fair that Alan should've had to make that decision? No. But that doesn't change the fact that society is bigger than any individual person and that had Alan chosen to be celibate he would've lived a longer life and with more opportunities to contribute to scientific and technological progress. Therefore it would have been the right thing for him to do. Alan then could have decided to be public about being celibate, saying that he was committed to celibacy for the sake of focusing more keenly on computer science. Or he could've even publicly admitted to being gay and pushed for gay rights but said he was celibate and said let the public know that the reason he was choosing celibacy was to avoid destroying his career and depriving society of innovation and progress. The second option would've been more risky and may have cost him some career opportunities, but since he wouldn't have been breaking the law he could have gone on collaborating with more enlightened fellow computer scientists and so could've kept promoting technological advancement while also sending out a positive social message for gay rights as well as a strong message of commitment to the common good, which is sorely lacking in modern day society.

68	S8eb1310b-Ae57049fa	2	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Celibacy is outdated	Priestly celibacy is out-dated. It sets the priest apart from the modern world and the experiences of his parishioners. Originally, around 1100 the Gregorian Reform movement in the church was keen to enforce celibacy for fear that too many married priests would leave church property and benefices to their children, or create local priestly dynasties.[1] At the time these fears were reasonable and necessary to maintain the property and discipline of the church, but today they are utterly unnecessary.

68	Sacd1c1f6-Af13667be	0	0	Should celibacy be abolished?	Capitol punishment should be abolished	"Slogan: En eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. Capitol punishment should be abolished because of a high possibility for error, the fact that it is an unethical practice, and its high cost. 1) Capitol punishment should be abolished because of its high possibility for error. By ruthlessly killing people who are convicted, prosecutors are completely obliterating any hope of correcting their mistakes if it turns out the prosecutors were wrong. According to a study done by Columbia Law School Professor James Liebman, 68 percent of all death verdicts reviewed from 1973-1995 were revised by courts due to serious error. Of those revisions, 82 percent ended in less harsh sentences, and 9 percent of those people were found innocent and eventually freed. Since capitol punishment was reintroduced in America in 1973, 99 death row inmates have been exonerated, raising questions about its validity and leading to mounting pressure among opponents for it to be scrapped or at least suspended. If these convicted people are sentenced to death, and then are later found to be innocent, the legal system has just murdered NINETY NINE people who didn't deserve to die. http://www.cbsnews.com... Wrongful conviction is also present in modern times. According to the nonprofit Death Penalty Focus, there have been at least four men wrongfully killed in the past two years. Also, 139 men and women have been released from Death Row nationally… some only minutes away from execution. How many more might have been released, had then not been executed? We will never know… and that's just the problem. Examples of this include Troy Davis, executed despite the fact that, according to Amnesty International, all but two of the state's non-police witnesses from the trial have recanted or contradicted their testimony and many of these witnesses have stated in sworn affidavits that they were pressured or coerced by police into testifying or signing statements against Troy Davis. Another example is Cameron Todd Willingham, wrongfully executed under the charge of setting his house on fire and killing his three daughters. Just imagine the horror his parents must have felt, having lost all three beloved granddaughters and then having to watch their equally beloved son be executed! http://www.deathpenalty.org... If an innocent person's life is taken, that is murder. Murdering innocent people is something that belongs within the confinement of the past. Slaughter belongs to war, and countries that oppress their people. We cannot continue a ruthless practice without looking deeper into our society and our values. Is this what is at the heart of America? 2) Capitol punishment should be abolished because it is way too expensive. Capitol punishment is much more expensive than life in prison without parole because the Constitution requires a long and complex judicial process for capital cases. According to deathpenaltyinfo.org, in the Report of the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, it states that, ""The additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to maximum security prisons where those sentenced to life without possibility of parole ordinarily serve their sentences, is $90,000 dollars per year per inmate. With California's current death row population of 670, that accounts for $63.3 million annually."" Also, using conservative rough projections, the Commission states that the annual costs of the present death row system to be $137 million per year. And that is JUST in California! This is yours and my taxpayer money that goes toward murderers. Even worse, what if a person is innocent? That's millions of our money down the drain. If the death penalty was replaced with a sentence of ""Life Without the Possibility of Parole"", which costs millions less, the money saved could be spent on programs that actually improve the communities in which we live. The millions of dollars in savings could be spent on things like our $14 trillion debt, education, public safety programs, health services, the possibilities are endless. 3) Capitol punishment should be abolished because it is immoral. Article 3 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights states ""Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person"". Most developed countries around the world recognized these rights have abolished capitol punishment or they are considering it. According to Amnesty International, in 1977, only 16 countries had abolished capitol punishment for all crimes. As of December 2010 that figure stands at 96 and more than two thirds of the countries in the world have abolished capitol punishment in law or practice. In 2010, only 23 countries used capitol punishment. http://www.amnesty.org... Deathpenalty.org lists the number of executions by country. In 2010, China led the world with over 1,000 executions, Iran had 252, North Korea had 60, Yemen had 53, followed by the US with 46. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... With capitol punishment in place, the US is consistent with countries that have horrible human rights histories with their people. Meanwhile, The European Union and the United Nations General Assembly have drafted rules to abolish capitol punishment. In order to keep up with democratic, modern, and civilized nations, it is neither wise nor moral for the U.S. to have capitol punishment in place."	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

One reason is the unnatural staright jacket of priestal celibacy, which is manifested in the sickening crimes committed by the Chritsian brothers. There is no basis for enforced celibacy and by making sex such a taboo the church has, and continues to, force priests down the path of rape and crime as they release their sexual tension. In no way is this excusing the repulsive, sinister and vile individuals at the heart of these traumatic cases but the church must re-assess and reform its policies to ensure it doesn't happen again.

68	Sea2e9a61-Aed455ca	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Gay marriage should be legal	"I appreciate the opportunity to be debating such a important topic. In this debate, I will be arguing that the United States government should not legalize same-sex marriage. I think we should start by actually establishing what the term 'marriage' means. Since we are debating on the legalization of same-sex marriage then we should look into the governments description of it. We should note that a personnel view on marriage does not change the governmental description and usage of marriage. What is Marriage? The governmental usage of the term marriage means, ""In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word ""marriage"" means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ""spouse"" refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.""[2] Currently there are 37 states that have passed laws which define marriage as 'limited to a union between one man and one woman.' Thirteen states, therefore, do not currently have laws on their books which limit marriage to a union between one man and one woman.[1] As we see in our current governmental usage of marriage we have the determining factor as one male and one female. The purpose of marriage is to continue with the survival of humanity. The marriage between a man and a woman has been the primary factor for the growth of society. We have our justification for the current use of marriage by the government. We in fact see that there is a separation of church and state in the United States.[3] No legal right It can be no doubt true that marriage should be a legal right for everyone that lives up to the definition of marriage by our government. Same-sex marriage does not fulfill the purpose of marriage so set by our government and therefore should not be legal. Same-sex marriage is not protected or justified by equal or protection rights or laws because there is basically no such right to begin with.[5] ""So before we can conclude that some marriage policy violates the Equal Protection Clause, or any other moral or constitutional principle, we have to determine what marriage actually is and why it should be recognized legally in the first place."" [4] My opponent must first qualify same-sex marriage has having the equal right to be married. He can not invent his own version of marriage to fit his needs but must use the term in the way our government uses it if we are to determine if same-sex marriage should be legal. No law should be passed that goes in direct conflict with the majority of the peoples voting opinion. People should not have their tax dollars used to support something they find wrong. Gay marriage would entitle gay couples to typical marriage benefits including claiming a tax exemption, receiving social security payments, and coverage by a health insurance policies.[9] Social Norms ""Social norms are the shared expectations of group members in a social situation or Social norms are the standard of right and wrong in society. The society expects from its members to abide by the normative behavior. Culture provides sources of conformity to the norms and an intimidation to their violation. These norms guide our interaction pattern on the one hand and are reproduced during the same process. Without the existence of group’s norms, human behavior cannot be differentiated from animal behavior. Social norms protect our values. Social norms are the boundary walls for values protection.""[8] The reason for change in norms is growth but same-sex marriage provides no growth. It has been the norm throughout society that marriage is between a man and woman exhibited in my first contention. It causes grief and puts a 'on the spot' situation for parents explaining these abnormal activities. This will cause discomfort in parents and also children. Even a young child knows that mommy and daddy makes babies. Loss of meaning ""When words lose their meaning, people lose their freedom."" Confucius By allowing same-sex couples to wed, marriage will no longer have the same meaning it once had. After we allow same-sex marriage, what then will be next? What reasons would one have for stopping polygamy or polyandry? ""It's not a good idea for society to move away from the time-honoured position of marriage as a union between a man and a woman."" Dr Sharon James, Coalition For Marriage campaign group[7] Changing the definition and understanding of marriage will affect the whole of society. The main aspects and productive understandings of society about the union of marriage centers around rearing children. Inadequate parenting Though rarely thought about is the view children take upon marriage. What does a child think about having a same-sex parental environment? This could thus give alot of confusion on a child by not being able to determine if men should be with men or men should be with women and vice versa. Are we to say that a child is not much more productive when their home rears both a man and woman as parents? ""Marriage is already threatened with high divorce rates (between 40% and 50%) and with 40.6% of babies being born to unmarried mothers in 2008. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would further weaken the institution.""[9] There is also a overwhelming need for adoption for society and 'yes' same-sex couples do in fact help in this regard but this hardly provides just means for same-sex couples to become married. There is in fact reason to believe that even if they were to become parents, they would not do as an adequate job as heterosexuals.[7] ""The deficiencies of studies on homosexual parenting include reliance upon an inadequate sample size, lack of random sampling, lack of anonymity of research participants, and self-presentation bias. On the other hand, there is an abundance of evidence to demonstrate the dangerous consequences of homosexual behavior and the unstable nature of homosexual relationships. And despite the weaknesses of the research focused specifically on homosexual parents, there is significant evidence that their children suffer, particularly in the area of sexual adjustment. Meanwhile, a well-established and growing body of evidence (amply documented in FRC’s companion volume, The Family Portrait) shows that both mothers and fathers provide unique and irreplaceable contributions to the raising of children. Children reared in traditional families by a mother and father are happier, healthier, and more successful than children raised in non-traditional environments.""[6] Conclusion As we have seen our government has no benefit for legalizing same-sex marriage. The majority of society has declined to accept same-sex marriage. Household that have a same-sex marriage can effect a child's understanding of social norms. By allowing same-sex marriage we will strip the meaning of marriage as it has been known. To end, same-sex couples simply do not have the right to marry. Therefore same-sex marriage should not be legalized. Back to Pro! Sources [1] http://www.clgs.org... [2] http://www.law.cornell.edu... [3] ""Same Sex marriage: Should it be legalized?""

68	Saac0c3af-A772efb5d	1	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Biblical Reason Against Homosexuality	"I repeat point number 8 and 9 of my first post: 8. Marriage is about commitment. Marriage often involves procreation, But according to the New Testament, It""s based on something deeper: a lifelong commitment to a partner. Marriage is even compared to the relationship between Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:21-33), And while the language used is opposite-sex, The core principles apply just as well to same-sex couples. 9. Human beings are relational. From the beginning of Genesis, Human beings are described as having a need for relationship, Just as God himself is relational (Genesis 1:26-27, 2:18). Sexuality is a core part of what it means to be a relational person and to condemn LGBT people""s sexuality outright damages their ability to be in a relationship with all people and with God. Also what about families who are infertile are they sinning if they don't reproduce should the person who is fertile divorce the unfertile individual and find someone else? Of course not! This shows that such command is only for fertile heterosexual people. On Celibacy and Homosexuality. I took an oath of celibacy because I have a general disinterest in marital and sexual relationships but not all LGBTQ people have that and the Bible says that celibacy is a gift, Not a mandate again I repeat from my first post point 3: 3. Celibacy is a gift, Not a mandate. The Bible honours celibacy as a good way of living""Jesus was celibate, After all, But it also makes clear that celibacy must be a voluntary choice made by those who have the gift of celibacy (1 Corinthians 7:7-9, Matthew 19:11). Requiring that all gay people remain celibate because their sexuality is ""broken"" is at odds with the Bible""s teachings on celibacy. The gift affects the choice and without the gift, The choice should not be made. On long hair. What is sinful about long hair? Tell me and I won't refer to it as a cultural convention. On pig eating and wearing two different fabrics. The point here is that this was a ceremonial sin that does not and never has applied to Christians due to the obsolete law fulfilled by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. On abomination terms yet's take a closer look. I borrow from Matthew Vines and his views on the subject. The term Abomination can be applied to a broad range of subjects that Christians don't consider to be applicable to themselves for an example just read Deuteronomy 14:3-21 which addressed things like eating pork. Abomination is a term used to describe practices which are foreign and not distinctively part of Israeli ceremonial law. We see this in Genesis 43:32 and Exodus 8:26 where the Israelities could not eat with the Egyptians as well as offer sacrifices Yahweh near Pharaoh's palace because the Egyptians considered it an abomination. The nature of the term abomination is cultural specific because it deals with the cultural and religious difference held between the Jews and their neighbours. It is not a statement about intrinsic goodness and intrinsic evil. I will deal now with something you didn't bring up which is the objection from the death penalty mentioned in Leviticus. Should we regard homosexuality as sinful because God gives it the death penalty? The answer is no and here's why. The death penalty was instituted because of all the issues facing was soon to be a sovereign state and thus maintaining order and cohesiveness was of paramount importance and so punishments were to be harsh. This includes non-moral issues such as working on the Sabbath and charging interest on loans as seen in Exodus 35:2 and Ezekiel 18. In other words just because something gets the death penalty in OT doesn't mean it should be viewed as sinful as there is too much variance for that to be a consistent and effective approach. The default Christian approach has been to see the ""old law"" as being fulfilled by Christ and there is no good reason why that can't be said about homosexuality prohibitions in Leviticus. God's law in the OT was made for Israel temporarily. Christ fulfilled the law and thus it is obsolete. The sexual revolution and its tension with Christianity are based on a mockery of the traditionalist interpretation and lack of contextualization. Also, I am not a false teacher but a rational agent who has taken great interest on this subject and has come out with my mind changed from its original position after doing my ""homework"" if you will.

68	S3efd7af1-Aaa1f2038	1	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Organised religion is a force for evil and the world would be much better off without it.	"I would like to thank con for taking the time to define the debate and I wish to state that I completely agree with his definition. I don't wish to make this debate about the legitimacy of religion and the ideas it preaches as it does not much bother me wether someone believes in a god, a goblin or a flying spaghetti monster. In other words this debate isn't about wether the claims of religion are true, but about wether these claims have a negative impact on the world. However, it occurs to me that it's next to impossible to have a decent conversation about religion without first taking some time to talk about why it's claims are false. As I wish to make this part of my writing quick I will limit it to one small, but very persuading, argument. Religion offers no evidence to support the extraordinary claims it makes. This is enough to dismiss the claims made by religion because, as Christopher Hitchens so rightly put it, ""'That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence."" Well, now that I've got that out of the way I shall put forward my first argument as to why I think religion does a great disservice to humanity. Organised religion stunts progress. By this I do not mean to say it stunts scientific progress, though it most certainly does, but I mean to say it stunts our moral progress. Religion declares a certain moral code to be infallible, unalterable and divinely written. This code is normally one jotted into parchment by brutal sexually-repressed desert dwellers living in the most archaic and medieval periods of human history. By declaring these holy books to be infallible, organised religion makes philosophy and questioning impossible and, by extension, religious people and the societies they hold hostage are forced to live under the static tyranny of a morality they cannot question. As I am limited to how many words I can use I am only able to give you a three examples of this, but believe me there are many many more. My first example is homophobia. How is it that in the 21st century homosexuals are still treated like second class citizens? Religion has made it impossible for people to question their own bigotry and is creating a very intolerant world. There is still a struggle going on in politics to give gay people complete equality before the law and allow them to get married. People, merely because their love is deemed to be the wrong kind of love by ancient holy books, are not aloud to marry the love of their life. In America suicide rates are four times higher amongst homosexual children than they are amongst 'straight' children. These rates rise even higher again, to a disturbing eight times the usual rate, if the gay child has homophobic parents. I'm sure you'll agree with me these are grotesque figures and it is the first of many examples of how religion literally murders people. From the obscene bullying in high schools to the denial for gay couples to adopt children and raise a loving family, religion has trapped the imagination of believers into the mindset of the Middle-eastern desert five and a half thousand years ago. My second example of the static-morality is sexism. Churches everywhere are still screaming for ""traditional family values"" (a grotesque euphemism for the thuggish system of hierarchy where women are reduced to sex slaves and baby-machines, while men are told to be macho and ""manly"" and never show any sign of emotion.) The devout are still, in the modern day of science and enlightenment, attempting to deny women the right to chose what happens to their own bodies. How many women have had to die from unsanitary and dangerous abortions because of the preaching of these archaic and fanatical religions? I'm glad, as I'm sure I'd find the number far to distressing, that I don't have the means of counting how many young Muslim women have had their lives stolen from them in honour killings, because of the filthily patriarchal culture of slut-shaming and victim-blaming that is promoted by the Qur'an. I'm equally glad I don't know how many women have had their genitals carved off by sharp shards of dirty glass because of the perceived purity of virginity promoted by Islam, or the amount of women who are being beaten and raped everyday by their Muslim husbands. How can we ever hope to crawl out of the primeval-swamps of patriarchy when billions of people are dedicated to the supposed infallibility of a book which says, sexism is divine law? My third example is sexuality in general. As Voltaire said ""It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge."" Religion, specifically the Abrahamic religions, have freeze-framed the ridiculous idea, held by the Jews in 3500 BCE that sex is in some way a shameful act. This belief has cause literally billions of people to feel guilty and ashamed merely for having an innate, and completely natural, urge to reproduce. How many teenagers have had to feel demonised and immoral because of the sinister Catholic prohibition of masturbation? The stigma of sex is bad in itself as it demonises a victimless crime. To prohibit something which is victimless is to be tyrannical and for that reason the religious view of sex is one we should not tolerate. People should be allowed to have as much or as little sex as they want without feeling judged and guilty. The stigma of sex is making it impossible, in the modern world, to get comprehensive sex education into our public schools. Studies show time and time again, kids who get a good sex education are less likely to end up with an unwanted pregnancy of an STI. Sexual repression also leads, as Sigmund Freud pointed out, to cases of catastrophic violence and perversion. Why is it that so many priests have ended up raping young alter-boys? Is it possible the tiring restraints of celibacy made them crack? Could a big reason for the mounting conflicts in the middle east be the sexual repression which is mandated by Islam? If we wish to create a better society we must remove the stigmatisation of the sexual act. This cannot happen unless we first remove the mental-shackles of religion. Well, they are three examples of how claims of infallibility are tearing our society apart. Compared to my next example these are only small and minor things. In many countries in the middle east the infallibility of religious dogma is taken so seriously it leads to civilisations that are forbidden from any kind of questioning what so ever. This has created one of the most tyrannical totalitarian legal systems plaguing the world today; Sharia Law. Under sharia law homosexuals are buried alive as a means of execution. Adulterers are stoned to death in the street and fornicators are whipped (women are given more whips than men for the same crime.) The testimony of a woman is worth half that of a man, and the Burqa, or at least Hijab, are mandated by law. Alcohol is prohibited and witch craft (yes, you read that right) is punishable by death. Non-Muslims are subject to an extra tax and apostates have to face the death penalty. Sharia law is the legal system in many countries all through the Middle-East and this kind of theocracy will continue to go on unless people begin to question their views on morality rather than taking their opinions straight from some bronze aged book."

68	Sc297f89a-A6e7c33f6	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	The historical Jesus Christ was a doomsday cult leader	"Crossan's series of 180s to model Christian originsCon disagrees with me that the celibacy is an indication of asceticism, claiming that ""most historians attribute the idea of celibacy to the later Christian Church.""Con also disagrees with my claim that the theory of his championed author (JD Crossan) would require that the religious tradition of Jesus requires two 180 degree turns, with both the predecessor and successors of Jesus being apocalyptic asceticist but not Jesus himself, because, Con claims, the follower of Jesus were not ascetics.Con's preferred historian, JD Crossan, would disagree with Con on both points. Crossan believes that the primary follower and successor of Jesus, Paul, was both ascetic and apocalypticist.On page 48 of the book by MJ Borg and JD Crossan, The First Paul: Reclaiming the Radical Visionary Behind the Church's Conservative Icon, the authors arrirm that Paul was ascetic, stating:""Paul himself was an ascetic celibate and may indeed have already been one in his pre-Christian practice of Judaism--at least he never mentions Jesus as a model for abnegation of that portion of the world's normal social relations.""On page 176 of the book by JD Crossan and JL Reed, In Search of Paul: How Jesus's Apostle Opposed Rome's Empire with God's Kingdom, the authors affirm that Paul was apocalypticist, stating:""Paul was wrong, just as every other hope, expectation, proclamation, or prophecy of imminent apocalyptic consummation has been consistently wrong throughout all of human history--at least so far.""And Crossan is right on both points. The asceticism of Paul is seen in 1 Corinthians 7:7, which is the only passage within Paul's authentic letters that would indicate the continuation of Paul's tradition of celibacy and asceticism, but Crossan takes this passage as evidence enough that Paul was ascetic. The apocalypticism of Paul is seen in 1 Corinthians 7:26-31.Unfortunately for Crossan, these affirmations underlie the implausibility of his own theory. Crossan believes that John the Baptist and Paul were both apocalyptic ascetics, but he also believes that Jesus, the only link between John and Paul, was entirely different.King Arthur the red herring?If the point about King Arthur is a red herring, then Con is the one who put the red herring in the pond. But, such self-deprecation is not deserved. King Arthur is relevant to this debate.In Round 1, Con suggested that Jesus was an amalgamation of different stories. In Round 2, I rebutted that this would be implausible given that seemingly no other mythical characters in antiquity were an amalgamation of many other different characters. Con rebutted with the claim that King Arthur was such an amalgamation, and he cited sources. In Rounds 3 and 4, I questioned these sources. In Round 4, Con now calls the point about King Arthur a red herring, and he now shifts his argument and claims that King Arthur, like Jesus, has diversified.On this last point, I agree. But, remember, Con was the one who suggested that Jesus was an amalgamation of mythical characters, and he claimed King Arthur as evidence. If he were right, then it would provide plausibility to the proposition that Jesus was an amalgamation. Since Con has failed to substantiate his claims, the proposition is shown to be implausible. More copycat-Jesus claimsCon is a talented debater, which explains his explempary record, but I have a special advantage--I have debated this topic many times in the past. I happen to have a copy of her book, The Christ Conspiracy, and the author simply does not specify the ancient sources for her controversial claims. Instead, she cites other fringe authors. Fringe authors constitute the entirety of her bibliography and the majority of her chapter endnotes. That is why I carefully worded my demand for sources: ""...find quotes and specific citations to the ancient documents..."" I already know that the author Acharya S CLAIMS that her information is rooted in the ancient sources, such as Pyramid Texts, Coffin Texts, Book of the Dead, etc. Each of these sets of texts are translated and published online, with the links listed as follows:http://www.sacred-texts.com... (Pyramid Texts)http://en.wikipedia.org... (Coffin Texts, Parts I, II and III)http://www.sacred-texts.com... (Book of the Dead)So, my challenge remains essentially the same as before, but I will provide more specifics: hunt down the evidence for her essential claims about these texts, and prove it with a quote and a link containing the translations of the ancient texts. Since Con stands behind his position that the character of Horus was crucified, then I suggest Con focus on the crucified Horus to fulfill the challenge. If Con succeeds in this, it means that I can copy the words of Con's quote, I can go to a page of ancient translated text from a link that Con provides, I can type CTRL-F and CTRL-V to find the words of the quote, and those words are sufficient to suspect that Horus was crucified according to ancient myth.I won't even limit the challenge to those three ancient sources listed above. Go to any ancient source, such as Herodotus or Plutarch. Win this challenge, and win the debate.Historical silence about JesusSince Con has thankfully not Gish Galloped again, I will go back to a point he made in Round 3, directly relevant to the debate. He claimed: ""The third Youtube video shows 23 major historians who were alive during Jesus' time who fail to record anything about Jesus, or any other MAJOR events of the New Testament, such as King Herod ordering all babies in Bethlehem killed.""So, this point often comes up in debates about the existence of Jesus, and it is most relevant when the opponent is a Christian who believes that Jesus entered and exited the world with nuclear explosians of implausible events per the New Testament canon. The point is NOT so relevant against opponents who believe Jesus was, in his own time, only one of many regular human lowerclass religious leaders. The point that there are existing copies of only about 23 writers in that wide time period and heavily populated region underscores the counterpoint that almost all writings were lost to the sands of time. But, when Christianity grew, so did the reputation of Jesus, and that is when Jesus starts showing up in extant writings. At 3:33 in the third video, the narrator seems to disagree with the claim that ""Christ"" refers to Jesus in three passing historical mentions by ancient writers. One of them is the writing of Tacitus, as follows:Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired.Source: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu...I leave it to Con and the readers to decide whether this passage really refers to Jesus Christ or if it refers to some other Christ as the narrator claims.I feel lucky to have been a part of this debate.

68	Scee72b1d-A4ba3f04a	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	Sb2548cca-Af90edf03	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Psychiatry is a hoax and should be abolished	"I thank my opponent for his response and for demonstrating passion towards this debate topic. My Case ++++++++++++|) ==================D While psychiatry might be looked upon with awe and revere for whatever work it may do, the fact remains that there are aspects hidden from us. Aspects created for the sole purpose of clouding the hidden truth behind psychiatry. Aspects created to cover the savage truth that psychiatry is a hoax. Contention one: Effectiveness Psychiatry should not be abolished as it has a place in our society, however certain reforms need to take place to further the effectiveness of this practice. When looking into the resolution at hand, we find that the question is not to abolish psychiatry itself, but to abolish psychiatry as a medical specialty. Psychiatry itself is not a hoax, it only become a hoax when medical solutions are used to solve non biological problems. With this said, lets now look into the link between the topic of effectiveness and the given resolution. Although psychiatry might have a place in our society, medical education itself does absolutely nothing to aid this practice. Why is this? The answer is simple, the perception of mental illness as a biological entity is highly mistaken, thus psychiatric treatment's such as drugs and electroshock are proven infective as they are unable to properly diagnoses the real problem or the real cause of the so called mental illness. Now when looking into non medical form of treatment used by modern day psychiatrist such as counseling and psychotherapy, we find that these methods are more efficient as they are not focused on solving a physical or chemical disorder. Breaking this barrier, they are now able to properly diagnose the cause of the ""mental illness."" ""You also know, I am sure, that there is no physical or chemical abnormality to be found in life, or at autopsy, in 'depression, bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses'. Why then are you telling the American people that 'mental illnesses' are 'physical' and that they are due to 'chemical disorders'?"" {1} ""The fact that a depression can be caused by a disease like cancer doesn't mean depression as such is a disease. And the fact that certain depressions are ""maintained"" (not ""caused"") by disturbances in the body's energy system, which is shown by the fact that they can be resolved with EFT (which I'll discuss in a moment) also doesn't mean that depression is a mental or physical disease. In that case it just means it's a condition that can be resolved by a manipulation on the body together with the mind.""{1} In conclusion, psychiatry should be abolished as a medical specialty. In doing this, we are now able to reform it in a manner that it is able to properly diagnose mental illness as a mental problem and not a physical problem. Contention two: Necessity Like explained in my first contention, the use of medical procedures in terms of psychiatry is highly flawed. Now lets expand on how the practice harms the patient. After going t5o medical school for several years and graduating with a doctorate degree, one cannot help but add the knowledge acquired to everything they do. When this individual becomes a psychiatrist, he/she is now unable to solve any mental problems without having the urge to use a more medical approach. This now leads to many prescriptions which we all know is an ineffective way to solve psychological problems. This could in turn harm the patient as they were misdiagnosed and given the wrong solution. Thus the following conclusion is made:a) Abolish psychiatry as a medical specialty to save multiple life and B)Abolish psychiatry as a medical specialty to create a reform in modern psychiatry thus transforming the precise of psychotherapy and counseling from a hoax and into a well respected practice. Abolishing psychiatry as a medical specialty will allow psychiatrists to focus more on helping someone deal with there psychological problem rather than an imaginary physical or chemical disorder. ""But it does more: it given them a false and detrimental attitude.ï¿½ ...analytic instruction would include branches of knowledge which are remote from medicine and which the doctor does not come across in his practice: ""{2} ""In fact, Ethan Watters & Richard Ofshe in their book ""Therapy's Delusions"" report that ""In a review of forty-two studies comparing professional therapists with paraprofessional therapists (such as teachers given the job of counseling students), only one study showed that the trained therapists got better results. Twenty-nine studies showed no difference between the two groups, and the remaining twelve studies showed that the paraprofessionals actually outperformed the professional therapists.""ï¿½{1} This proves that psychiatry is more about helping people deal with there original problems rather than using medical solutions. Thus, psychiatry should be abolished to allow for both maximum and accurate treatment of psychological problems. My opponents Case ==========================D My opponent does make a valuable point that psychiatry saves lives; however, like I mentioned in my early citations as well as contentions, psychiatry saves lives through the use of open conversations such as counseling rather than medical solutions. The resolution states that psychiatry is a hoax and should be abolished as a medical specialty and thus eliminating the medical part of psychiatry will fulfill both my burden of proof by proving that modern practice of using medicine in psychiatry is a hoax and should be abolished as it threatens the safety of many and hinders the understanding of human psychology. ""Modern medicine involves diagnosing and treating diseases. [4] Psychiatry does just that. Hence, it is a medical science and should be considered a medical specialty. ""{3} My opponent misunderstands psychology in every way. There is absolutely no prove that psychological issues can be or rather is a disease, thus according to my opponents definition of medicine, can not be consider medical in any way. In conclusion, psychiatry practiced in the modern day is a hoax and in an effort to reform this hoax, we must abolish the psychiatry as a medical specialty.

Well okay then I can easily argue that if you forgive them once, it is equally stupid as the millionth time since the immorality of cheating is constant for each time it occurs and if anything the pain the second time would be far less since you'd already have had experience of how to deal with it and would overcome it quicker (emotional resistance works like immunity to disease)."

68	Saac0c3af-A43f90879	0	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Biblical Reason Against Homosexuality	"Sorry, It has taken me so long to respond I have been very busy. Mr. Vines ""sympathy"" story does not disprove or weaken his arguments and so I see no reason why you need to bring it up. Mr. Vines point here is that our understanding of sexuality is different from that of Antiquity which affected the writing of intellectuals of that age. This is confirmed by the fact that the main views on homosexuality stemmed from Pederasty, Prostitution, And sexual slavery. Paul would have been well aware of this because it was the norm of Roman Antiquity. The point Mr. Vines is getting at is that contextualization is important. Take for example how many Church today take Paul's writings on Female Ministry leadership, A good bit of Christians say that Paul was writing based on a culture where women did not take the leadership role and was not writing based on the decree from his ""maker"". The same applies to homosexuality and to authoritative texts in scripture. Mr. Vines give scripture as his evidence. His evidence is written in (1 Corinthians 7:7-9, Matthew 19:11). There is context and as I have shown with Paul it is very important to understand. Remember it is the context that we use when answering objections based on the apparent Immoral God of the OT. So Mr. Vince is not begging the question. Okay so as I have argued before abomination can be applied to a broad range of things that Christians don't consider sinful just read Deuteronomy 14 so abomination does not necessarily work anymore as the term had more to do with what was foreign to Israel than what was moral. Also just because Genesis call the angels ""men"" does not mean that Mr. Vines' strange flesh argument is invalid but if anything further confirmed. Further speaking Jude does not specifically define the sexual immorality and perversion and so here you are begging the question. As I have argued the OT law was temporary and was fulfilled by Christ effectively abolishing it. Also, Vines argued that there is no reason to accept homosexual prohibitions when you don't accept other prohibitions because you realize they applied to cultural law and not the moral law such as the planting of crops and the mixing of fabrics regulations. The old law is dead. Combined with the arguments concerning Paul you still fail to show me where Mr. Vines is wrong. When addressing Paul one must understand Context which I talked about before so now you are just going in circles repeating the same arguments despite my refutations. You are using a lot of words to say very little. Okay, So I will concede here that the argument that term homosexual didn't exist until 1892 isn't really a strong argument in of itself here is what Vines is saying. Paul used the terms he did in the context of a condemnation of same-sex exploitative relationships what I say is that Paul has no authority to decide who will enter the Kingdom as nothing suggest that God was telling him who will enter and so Paul is basically begging the question. I assume what Vines is saying here is that the basis for Marriage is relationship backed up by his celibacy argument as well as context and marriage is not necessarily sexual, Procreative, Heterosexual, Vines does not say that marriage isn't Monogamous, Non-incestuous and symbolic of the gospel and the fact that you bring this up shows me that you misrepresent his argument. We have arguments and evidence that stand up under scrutiny and thus we shall adopt them. The fact you suggest otherwise is also a begging of the question fallacy. Finally. On humans are relational beings this is backed up by the celibacy argument which says that unless God has decreed that we be so then relationship are to be had and one is at odds with scripture to deny marriage relationships to homosexuals. In conclusion. The arguments have been given and in response, I have seen misrepresentations, Lack of contextualization, Circulatory arguments and logical fallacies. May my opponent try again."

68	S54ba7e53-Acd1809f	1	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Catholicism is morally sound and biblically correct	"Hi,Con has clearly misunderstood, or willfully ignored all of the definitions and criteria set in my opening statements:1."" I will not be weighing the good that the RCC does against the bad""I am not asking you to do that, merely state a valid independant moral standard and show how catholic *dogma* falls short of it.I provided those arguments assuming you were Athiest.Con does not bother define the moral standard he is going to use.2.Catholic Priest Child AbuseThe child abuse is *not* part of either the dogmatic constitution or the catechism, but is the action of errant priests.Catholics around the world see this as wrong and this is in direct violation of the catholic church's stand on homosexuality and sexual relationships.This weak argument inspite of my clear definition of catholicism and clear warnings that such statements would be considered as an attempt to sidetrack the debate is unfortunate.(While this may not be relevant, i would like to add that the number of Catholic priests that were caught was about 40, while the total number of priests in the church is about 400,000. So the claim that this is a widely prevalent 'epidemic' is false.This is not an argument, merely an observation.)3.Celibacy of ClergyThis is more in accordance with the criteria set.Con himself agrees that celibacy is not an absolute necessity for priesthood in Catholicism, but is only a 'disciplinary' decision that is binding on members following the *Western* Catholic rites.In general, the Eastern Catholic Churches allow ordination of married men as priests.[1] Thus the church has not contradicted the bible but has merely exercised its right given by the Holy Spirit to interpret the Bible.There are many places where celibacy is recommended for those serving the LORD.""All men take not this word:there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs, for the kingdom of heaven""-Matthew 19:12 is mentioned by con.this Statement is made by Jesus Chist himself(a higher authority than St.Paul by virtue of being the Son of GOD and one with the LORD) and shows explicitly that celibacy is preferred over married life.In 1Corinthians chapter 7, St.Paul *clearly* mentions that celibacy is prefered over marriage."" Now concerning the thing whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.""-1Cor 7:1-2That is, keep to his wife, which he hath. His meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry: on the contrary, he would have them rather continue as they are. (Ver. 7: 8.) But he speaks here to them that are already married; who must not depart from one another, but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state.the meaning becomes clearer as we continue reading along the same chapter""But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment. [7] For I would that all men were even as myself:...... But I say to the unmarried, and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I(unmarried)...But to them that are married, not I but the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her husband.""-1Cor 7:8-10""But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. [33] But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided. [34] And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world, how she may please her husband.[35] And this I speak for your profit: not to cast a snare upon you; but for that which is decent, and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.""-1Cor 7:32-35St.Paul clearly states that marriage is prefered over celibacy and allows marriage only in exeptional cases where the priest was already married or as an indulgence.So the catholic church is not altogether contradicting the bible when it chooses to impose a disciplinary decision regarding this indulgence, as it follows this teaching in spirit.Why would St.Paul who is clearly opposed to the concept of marriage in these verses, then seem to recommend marriage in the verses mentioned by Con?The first verse that Con proposed(1Tim 4:3) can be clearly seen to be taken out of context,when one sees the historical background in which this epistle was written""Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats:"" Here St.Paul speaks of the Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Eneratites, the Manicheans, and other ancient heretics, who absolutely condemned marriage, and the use of all kind of meat for all members of the church including lay members; because they pretended that all flesh was from an evil principle. Whereas the church of God, so far from condemning marriage, holds it a holy sacrament; and forbids it to none but such as by vow have chosen to become priests.the other verse is from Titus Ver:6""If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly"".These orders were given to allow already married men the chance to become priests, and mainly to prohibit polygamous and immoral members from entering the church, or holding positions of authority, as is evident from the next verse""For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre""-titus 7In all the cases when one sees the historical context, marriage was seen invariably as detrimental to service of the LORD and was only allowed as an indulgence when members were already married.The lives of Jesus as well as the Apostles clearly shows that celibacy was prefered.The Bishops of the Catholic Church are the true successors of the early Apostles.It is not wrong for them to agree to follow in the footsteps of the Aposltes and codify a disciplinary code that can clearly be seen as the intention of both St.Paul and Jesus Christ.The RCC was also the only church promised the guidance of the Holy spirit, Thus whenever there seems to be an apparent contradiction in biblical exegesis, it is only the catholic church that can decide the correct interpretation by virtue of the arguments I provided in my opening statement.Con must tell whose authority he relies on when there are seeming contradictions and must refute the claims of the RCC as the true heirs of the apostleseagerly anticipating you rebuttals..:) wish you all the best!"

68	Sd690e276-Ac4eef0d2	1	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Clerical Celibacy	"Hi Cynical Diogenes,Thank you for starting this debate, and am looking forward to a very fruitful discussion.My Opening Statements will be on the following points:1. An exclusive Clerical Order is unbiblical2. The disciplinary action of enforcing Celibacy on the elders and overseers of the Church is unbiblicalI will bring up the harm of this institution later.1. An Exclusive Clerical Order is UnbiblicalTo begin this argument, I will first highlight what a priest is according to the Bible.In the Old Testament, the Mosiac Law setup a Priesthood whose purpose were to be mediators, the one's who would perform sacrifices and intercede on behalf of the people of Israel to Yahweh. The leader of this organization in Israel would be the High Priest, whose function has now been replaced by Christ.""The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.""[1]In the book of Hebrews, the author writes about the superiority of the new Covenant, particularly in regards to the cessation of the Levitical Priesthood and restorcation of the Melchizedek with Jesus as the great and eternal High Priest.""For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.""[2]This is not all the New Testament has to say in regards to the priesthood, as here is the truly relevant information.Priesthood of All Believers""you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.""[3]In this passage, Peter uses the analogy of a house being built, by drawing from ancient Jewish symbolism. God is not building a new temple where only the exclusive Levitical Priesthood may enter. Rather, he is building a spritual house, not made of inanimate stones, but living stones, the Church, the people of God. And they collectively are to be the holy priesthood, and offer spritual sacrifices rather than the sheep and goats of old.[4][5] Peter also goes on to state:""But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.""[6]This passage cognates with Deuteronomy 7:6, where it says:“For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.""[7] This people in Christ (as Paul would put it) are now the people of God, those who are in union with Christ and believe on his name. They are the one's who have been redeemed, called out of darkness that they may proclaim God's excellencies to the world. This group, this Church, made up of all believers is the holy priesthood of the NT Church. They are the light of the world, given the ministry of reconciliation to be mediators between God and man as all men can now draw close to the throne of grace without the use of an exclusive mediatorial priesthood as was the case in the OT.2. The Disciplinary Action of Enforcing Celibacy on the Elders and Overseers of the Church is UnbiblicalIn the NT, the designated leadership is made up of Elders or also called Overseers.Here below is a list of qualfications for these leaders:1. ""Above Reproach""2. ""Husband of one wife""3. ""sober-minded""4. ""self-controlled"" 5. ""respectable"" 6. ""hospitable"" 7. ""able to teach""8. ""not a drunkard"" 9. ""not violent but gentle"" 10. ""not quarrelsome"" 11. ""not a lover of money"" 12. ""He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive""13. ""He must not be a recent convert""14. ""he must be well thought of by outsiders""Source: 1 Timothy 3:2-7 (ESV)Note, these are ""He must"" statements with an imperative command for those who were to aspire to this office must qualify for. This is not a recommendation, and therefore those who are not the husband of one wife and also those who do not have children do not qualify as they cannot fulfill the qualifications 2 and 12. Even when one looks into the Paul's logic of the qualifications this argument is made even stronger.""for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God’s church?""[8]The ability and experience of a husband and father properly managing his own household is in Paul's argument reason to believe he would be able to care for God's church. How in this argument would it make sense for the Church to then ignore this command, and appoint men who have never managed their own household and who have been single and without children their entire lives? This is in direct contradiction, and appoints men who are unqualified for their position, which not to mention is of an unbiblical nature because it is an exclusive priesthood.Conclusion:It is therefore incorrect based upon these points to have an exclusive Clerical order in which Celibacy is enforced.I look forward to my opponent's rebuttals and hope that this continues to be in line with our previous debate, which was thoughful and considerate.Kind Regards,TrueScotsman[1] Hebrews 7:23-25 (ESV)[2] Hebrews 7:28 (ESV)[3] 1 Peter 2:5 (ESV)[4] Hebrews 13:15-16 (ESV)[5] Romans 12:1 (ESV)[6] 1 Peter 2:9 (ESV)[7] Deuteronomy 7:6 (ESV)[8] 1 Timothy 3:5 (ESV)"	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind. This kind of sacrifice makes us heroic; This kind of sacrifice is nee"	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	S93bfd17d-A28c9a1be	0	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	birthright citizenship should be abolished in the U.S.	"1) Illegal babies are harmful to the economyThis argument was that illegal immigrants harm the economy by having babies in the US and then using birthright citizenship for the illegals to keep their kids in the US thus having them consume US services. I provided abundant proof showing that illegal immigrants do offset their own burden they put on the economy. Since illegal immigrants do not have a negative impact on the economy, birthright citizenship should not be abolished since it does not harm the economy. 2) HypocriticalMy entire arguments have been that all men are born with rights and that rights are not earned from generation to generation. Making people have to earn birthright citizenship and earn other rights is completely contrary to how we as a nation have gotten our rights in the first place. People shouldnt have to earn their rights and I never said that people should have to earn their rights, which is a reason why birthright citizenship shouldnt be abolished sicne rights are not something one has to earn.3) Other countries dont have birth right citizenshipThe point of this argument is that there is no valid reason why just because other nations dont honor certain rights the US shouldnt honor them either. There is also the argument that countries that do abolish birthright citizenship suffer economic backlash immediately afterwards, giving another reason why birthright citizenship should not be abolished. The Pro hasnt even addressed this point. 4) Birthright citizenship and racism""Because these people are coming here to have children, their neighbors for example, may engage in racist activities and stereotypical activities, which promotes racism and does nothing good.""You're arguing that birthright citizenship causes racism, I have pointed out that racists cause racism. Then you completely misinterpret what I said by saying ""when you abolish birthright citizenship, you are harming the welfare of average people, which is a Pro point.""So not only does my argument that birthright citizenship doesnt cause racism stand, but the Pro has single handedly admitted that abolishing birthright citizenship hurts people, which is a reason why it should NOT be abolished...""I would like to ask my opponent, Do you understand the resolution?""To answer your question, yes I do. I am CON abolishing birthright citizenship, you are PRO abolish birthright citizenship.

68	Sa560be9f-Ad13bd177	1	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Alan Turing Should Have Chosen Celibacy	"Even people who do great things still find some time for the ""simple daily pleasures"" I mentioned before. Hence why I brought that up. By not being celibate Alan Turing opened himself up for persecution and eventually was driven to suicide. Dying younger means losing even the simple pleasures. But the loss of the potential to do great things that would have helped humanity as a whole is an even greater loss. Hence, not only did the collective good lose out because of Alan Turing's decision not to be celibate, Alan Turing lost as well. His non-celibacy was a lose-lose decision. Con says that it takes more than an idea to do something. I'm not sure exactly what he is referring to. If he is referring to having an idea not being enough to get funding there are things which can be solved in mathematics simply with a chalkboard. He could've published those works and then possibly when they turned out to be useful he would've gotten credit and hence funding. Even if that didn't happen his works would've still contributed to progress eventually. If con is referring to my suggestion that Alan Turing could've been openly gay but also openly celibate in order to help promote gay rights it's difficult to tell what sort of impact that may or may not have had. Regardless all I have to prove to win this debate is that ""Alan Turing Should Have Chosen Celibacy"". I contend that if being openly gay and openly celibate wouldn't have done anything for the gay rights movement then Alan should've been openly celibate and closeted gay. Either way he should've chosen celibacy, since in choosing celibacy he would've prevented the possibility of being prosecuted for homosexual acts and so could've continued his work. Given his achievements up to that point in cracking the enigma code and producing his paper on ""the Halting Problem"" it is likely that he would've produced at least another few papers on mathematics and these would've helped to advance our understanding and so would've promoted the good of humanity. I have established why it would have been better both for himself and for the collective good for Alan Turing to have chosen celibacy. Vote Pro!"	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	Sd80c4d18-A3c1c1d7d	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	AIS intersex people prove that God does not condemn gay marriage	"Once again, my opponent opens his debate trying to justify his demand that this debate only refers to the Christian God, despite the fact he never explicitly laid this out in the opening. My opponent does not seem to understand the value of defining his resolution - he failed to lay out his definition, and it is his fault that he failed to do so, not mine.Beyond that, most of my opponent's argument for this round is simply unfounded ranting that has little to nothing to do with the debate resolution. Because of this I am ignoring most of it, with the following exceptions:*My opponent's first argument is trying to justify his claim that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality. He mostly claims every single condemnation of homosexuality in the Bible is a translational fault, but provides no sources to back up his claims. Further, this interpretation is simply bizarre given that both Christians and Jews have historically interpreted it as a ban on homosexuality.[1] If the English translation is faulty, wouldn't the original readers - the ancient Jews - have been all hunky-dory about gay relations being great and gay marriage being fine and critical of any interpretation that states otherwise? *Even more bizarrely my opponent states the present translation is only used to 'boost Bible sales' (lolwut?) and that newer translations are increasingly 'more homophobic'. He further claims 10% of people are gay and 90% are straight (what about bisexuals?) and thus the evil cabals that write the Bible are marketing to the 90%. Aside from the fact none of this is sourced, my opponent is being blatantly bigoted and heterophobic by assuming all straight people will buy a Bible that condemns homosexuality and this logic should be disregarded.*My opponent claims we do not live under the law of Moses anymore. However, in round 2 my opponent claims the word of God does not change. Which is it? This is yet another example of my opponent contradicting himself.*My opponent claims that Romans 1 doesn't condemn homosexuality because heterosexuality ""isn't natural to them"". This assumes homosexuality is purely genetic (which there is no actual proof of) and that people back in the days of the Bible knew it was genetic. Quite frankly it is an absurd argument.*He claims the point of this debate was to ""asking YOU how you reconcile your position on homosexuality, the Bible, and AIS people together without contradicting the Bible."" and that he hasn't contradicted himself at all. Both points are flatly wrong - the resolution has nothing to do with my personal feelings, and I have plainly established multiple times where my opponent contradicts himself.*He claims that ""I don't believe the Bible is the Word of God and I intend to prove that you can't hold the view that you do on homosexuality, AIS people, and the Bible, without contradicting yourself."" This flat-out pisses me off. My opponent has gone from creating a definition of God ex post facto to literally changing the debate resolution ex post facto. This debate is predicated on the existence of God (or, as you claim from Round 2 on, the existence of the Christian God), not hypothetical - if there is no Christian God, there is no God to approve of the debate resolution and thus I would win by default as Pro has the burden of proof here. This revisionism from my opponent should be proof enough of his poor conduct and reason for him to lose conduct points.*My opponent is using his own definition of 'just' - not a Biblical definition - to assert that no just God would oppose gay marriage. This is flat-out hypocritical, as he previously accused me of using my own opinions rather than evidence.Finally, my opponent asks me questions. I will not answer them, as:A) I've already answered most of them in some way or the other.andB) They do nothing to establish, positively or negatively, the factually of this debate resolution. The fact of the matter is, nothing my opponent has said has proven that the existence of AIS intersex individuals proves God approves of gay marriage. To the contrary, his debate arguments have hardly even argued the point. For example, the whole discussion on Biblical texts on homosexuality? It has nothing to do with intersex individuals justifying gay marriage in God's eyes. I have argued multiple alternate reasons (religious exemptions, celibacy, God might not exist) that could much more efficiently and adequately provide answers, but my opponent has hardly addressed any except for celibacy - and even then, he attempts to debunk it by arguing that, under his definition of 'just', God must support gay marriage. Add on to that my opponent's horrendous conduct and contradictory arguments and it becomes clear: a vote for Con is the only rational choice. The debate resolution has not been proven, and has in fact been adequately disproven. References:1. https://en.wikipedia.org..."	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	S13056969-A3f4e12a	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Conversion Therapy	"Outline:I. Conversion TherapyII. Is Homosexuality a Choice?III. The ""Success"" of Conversion TherapyIV. Sources I. Conversion TherapyConversion Therapy, also known as ""reparative therapy,"" is a psychological treatment that deals with ""changing"" a homosexual's sexual orientation to heterosexuality through rigorous and hazardous means such electroshock therapy [1].Conversion therapy also includes psychotherapy (performed by therapists, unlicensed laymen, or self-directed), exorcism, prayer, sexual celibacy, exposure to heterosexual pornography, enforced gender role stereotypes, and submitting to a same-gender heterosexual role model or mentor [2]. This practice is highly controversial, and for just cause. The means of ""praying the gay away"" are virtually torture- practitioners try to ""convert"" homosexuals by torturing them so that they mechanically associate their homosexual impulses with the trauma induced by the therapy. As of now, the United States, as a nation, has not outlawed Conversion Therapy. Nearly forty states have allowed Conversion Therapy to continue unchecked, even allowing minors to be subjected to these tortuous methods [3]. However, a bill has been recently proposed by Democrats that seeks to finally abolish conversion therapy, though of course, with Trump as president alongside the Republican-dominated Senate and House of Representatives, this bill is unlikely to be passed [4].II. Is Homosexuality a Choice?Conversion Therapy is founded on the idea that homosexuality is a choice (a sinful one no less). However, while conservative and religious media such as the FRC may say that homosexuality is indeed a choice and an abomination, recent scientific studies suggest that it is genetic. It has been concluded by many credible scientists, such as geneticist Dean Hamer of the National Cancer Institute and his team in 1993, that the ""gay gene"" lies in a region known as the Xq28 marker found on the X chromosome [5]. Dr. Tuck C. Ngun and his team at the University of California have confirmed this with their recent experiment. The team gathered 37 pairs of twins in which one was homosexual while the other was heterosexual. The team took a sample of blood from each volunteer. Through close examination, they isolated the Xq28 marker as likely being the area where the ""gay gene"" is located in [6].Homosexuality is not limited to just humans. It can also be witnessed in nature. Wild animals such as dogs may exhibit homosexual tendencies, not out of the conscious decision to betray God and pursue Satanic temptations, but because it's natural to them, clearly demonstrating how homosexuality is natural [7].III. The ""Success"" of Conversion TherapyThe ""success"" rate of Conversion Therapy ranges from around 11 to 37% [8]. However, this so-called ""success"" can mean anything from a homosexual person pursuing a heterosexual identity and objectively be trying to have relations with the opposite sex, or still retaining homosexual tendencies in the context of celibacy. In a study conducted by Dr. Robert Spitzner of 143 ""ex-gays"" who went through conversion therapy, he reported that 89% of the men still had feelings for people of the same sex [10]. The American Psychological Association has also supported this idea with research conducted in 2007. The APA has publicly said that the results of the scientifically valid research indicate that it is unlikely that individuals will be able to reduce same-sex attractions or increase other-sex sexual attractions through SOCE,"" [11].If the bleak ""success"" rates were not terrible enough, Conversion Therapy oftentimes leads its victims to depression, self-harm, and even suicide. For example, Bobby Griffith, a homosexual male who came out to his family at age 17, was pressured by the stigma from his family and church to seek conversion therapy. Due to the emotional baggage of being alienated by his community, and the emotional and physical trauma of the therapy, he committed suicide at the age of 20. Stories like these are not uncommon as most survivors of Conversion Therapy have also suffered some sort of trauma and conflictions. Because of the unfounded belief that homosexuality is ""a choice,"" and because of the ineffectiveness of conversion therapy alongside its horrific consequences, Conversion Therapy should be condemned.IV.

68	Sef3b04e9-A583e8e18	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Unique Topics Tournament Round 1 User v.s. Fire: Hate speech should be permitted	"I shall rebut Pro's statements: Observations In regards to the burden, it is pro's burden to prove that Hate speech should be permitted in general, while it is my burden that hate speech should not be permitted in general. Pro's argument boiled down P1) Con that not permitting hate speech does not mean not banning hate speech, only means consenting. P2) Not permitting means not allowing P3) Ban is close with not allow C1) (Thus, not allow= ban) C2) Therefore I am right. Pro's argument suffers from the non sequitur fallacy because the conclusions do not follow the premises. just because not allowing is synonymous with banning does not mean not allowing=banning. For example, a person can not allow someone to insult them, despite that this insult is not banned by the law. Pro also skips C1. Despite this being an implied conclusion, it makes the non sequitur even worse. Since P3 is wrong, C1 and C2 are also wrong, thus Pro's entire argument here is negated. Therefore my argument remains true, Not permitting hate speech is not a threat to freedom of speech, thus not permitting hate speech does not threaten liberty as a whole. R1. Hate Speech in Society, and why it shouldn't be banned Pro makes the following rebuttal against my school argument: ""Bullying is never going to end. The school will be lazy to ban it"" It does not matter if bullying is never going to end or not, as a community the people of a school should combat bullying however they can. One of these ways is not permitting hate speech in school by not making hate speech socially acceptable. When a behavior is not socially acceptable/tolerated there is a decrease in this behavior. This is what I am advocating for, to make hate speech not socially acceptable in school on the grounds that hate speech increases emotional harm and decreases academic performance and the quality of education. When a behavior is socially acceptable, however, it increases the likelihood of this behavior. Pro is advocating that hate speech should remain permitted, including in school, which leads to an increase of hate speech, bullying, emotional harm, and a reduction in academic performance and quality of education. Pro also gives no reasoning why hate speech should be permitted in school other than ""Bullying is never going to end. The school is too lazy to ban it"" while I listed legitimate reasons why hate speech should not be permitted in school, citing emotional harm and its negative effects. Pro also commits the over generalization fallacy with ""the school is too lazy to ban it"" when many schools have banned bullying/hate speech. Here's an excerpt from my High School in the Student Handbook: ""Speech: Students use words to encourage and support one another. Students refrain from inappropriate language, bullying, and other verbal and/or words that tear down one another."" (http://www.svcschools.org...) The school also has a policy against harassment. Pro says that teasing=bullying. Teasing is only bullying if it has the intent to abuse, so friendly teasing isn't bullying. Pro makes this rebuttal on my work argument: 1) Emotional harm at work, mistakes, and absences should be permitted (at work) should be permitted 2) If you are absent/doing something wrong, then you should be punished. 3) Con says hate speech should be banned because of emotional harm. 4) Con is unrealistic with saying all work is easy... it can't happen, don't even imagine it. 5) Work is called work because it has some emotional harms and stress. 6) No work is easy 7) Hate speech should and has to be permitted. Basically Pro's argument is: Hate speech should be permitted at work because work has emotional harms. Why should hate speech be allowed if work has emotional harms? Just because something is happening does not mean something should happen. The main cause of emotional harm at work is bullying, which includes hate speech. If hate speech and bullying is not permitted at work, then there will be a reduction of hate speech and bullying at work, thus reducing harm. Pro gives no reason why hate speech should be permitted other than his fallacious circular reasoning argument. Further, Pro states that ""Hate Speech should/ and has to be permitted."" Why does hate speech have to be permitted? Pro also contradicts his own circular argument ""It is the same, only that this means bullying like emotional harm at work, and mistakes, absences, etc. First of all, these things should be permitted. If you are absent, or doing something wrong, then you should be punished."" Pro is advocating that these wrong doings should be both permitted and punished at the same time. If something a behavior is allowed, then one cannot be punished for this behavior. ""Work has some emotional harms, and some stress, that is why it is called work."" No, work is called work because an employee works for an employer. Emotional harms caused by hate speech and other forms of bullying reduces the quality of an employee's work, thus hate speech should not be permitted at work. Article 2 Pro is saying that I am conceding that hate speech should be allowed by stating that ""People can still legally say hate speech as long as it doesn't cause violence."" This is not a concession of my argument, it is a statement of fact. I was not saying that hate speech should be allowed, I was saying that it is allowed. My R3 argument was that hate speech should not be allowed by a victim of hate speech or by society as a whole (including school and work, despite being legal at times Me stating this does not make me argue his side, because we are arguing different things. Article 3 ""My opponent says that ""go kill yourself"" to sudicial person will harm their life. There won't be lot's of people who are suicidal people in the U.S, probably 1 or 2 million out of few hundred million."" It does not matter if there are only a minority of people that are suicidal, each life is precious and should be protected from extreme threats. 1 or 2 million people is still a lot of people, and saying ""go kill yourself"" to a suicidal person threatens that life, thus saying ""go kill yourself,"" especially to a suicidal should not be allowed since it threatens their life. One of the causes of suicide is depression, which is caused constant bullying, harassment, and abuse by other people (http://www.nhs.uk...), which hate speech is a part of. If hate speech is not permitted by society then it decreases the likelihood of someone committing suicide. For the non suicidal person, saying ""go kill yourself"" results in emotional harm. Article 7 ""My opponent says that he was saying that all people are equal under the law. Not all people,"" Yes all people, in Section 1 of the 14th Amendment of the United States all US citizens have equal protection under the law, and in Article 7 of the UN DoHR all people are equal under the law, these are statements of legal fact. Pro states that Hitler lead well, this is false, for under Hitler's leadership Germany lost WWII and was occupied by the Allied powers Conclusion: The BoP of Pro is to prove that hate speech should be permitted and he has failed to do that. His main argument was that not permitting hate speech was a threat to liberty. I disproved this statement, proving that people and society can use freedom of speech to not permit hate speech, violating nobody's liberty. Pro then goes to arguing from the status quo in R4, stating that hate speech should be permitted in school and work because emotional harm happens. I am saying that hate speech should not be permitted on the basis of emotional harm and I have shown the negative effects of emotional harm, such as decreased quality of life, decreased academic and work performance, and increased risk of suicide. Since hate speech results in emotional harm, hate speech should not be permitted."	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	S43aee602-Ae9162e07	1	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Clerical rape of children is, in part, due to the celibacy of priests and must change	Celibacy requires 'not' mating; which obviously does not entail raping boys. Nuns are not busy raping children; now are they? Understood that sexual tension from repression can cause desperate measures; but that certainly does not justify statutory rape. Priests could secretly visit prostitutes but they do choir boys(and again this is NOT something most priests do). The problem is that such behavior is ignored and dismissed by the Pope himself; who strictly opposes homosexuality. The attitudes of the priests is not dissimilar to that of frat boys(members of a college fraternity), members of secret (boys')societies/clubs, and other all-male groups. Fraternity members are encouraged to have frequent sex; yet commit 90% more gang rapes than their non-fraternity college boy counterparts. The problem is not repression/suppression but the spread; one priest gets away with it and he's followed by many who know there no consequences for there actions from the church. The argument also ignores the fact, that child abuse goes on in non-celibate clergy (Protestant, Orthodox, Judaism, Islam). The abuser is also most likely a family member. If celibacy was a critical factor, we would not except these facts. The argument also fails to address the fact, that the priests who do abuse are a very small minority of the celibate clergy.

Priest have not always been celibate	While celibacy had been encouraged since the beginning of the church, until the beginning of the twelfth century, when it was banned by the Lateran Councils of 1123 and 1139, Priests in the Western church were permitted to marry.[1] The Bible does not mandate celibacy and, in fact, St Peter, the first pope, was married. Even today within the Catholic Church celibacy is not universal as Eastern Rite Catholics can marry and it is the norm that they do,[2] and there are some Lutheran and Episcopalian ministers who have converted to Catholicism.[3] The true history and traditions of the Roman Catholic Church include the option for priests to marry or at least for married men to become priests.

68	S942032ea-A9538fd80	0	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	celibacy	"Thank you to my opponent for his initial arguments!My opponent's resolution appears to be that ""Premarital-Sex is not morally wrong""Wrong - An unjust, dishonest, or immoral action. http://www.google.com...;Also, marraige will be refered to as any permenant, long term monogamous relationship that ends in death.What is morality This is a big question in today's society: What is morality? The common libertarian definition of morality follows along these lines: Do whatever you want so as long as nobody gets hurt as a result of it. This definition is obviously flawed.First off, this would mean it is morally wrong for two people to consentually box eachother, or participate in any sort of physical, hands-on sport. It also doesn't deal with the realm of potentially harmful. For instance, surrounding pre-marital sex obviously lies the possibilities of emotional trauma, STD's, and unwanted pregnancies. But using this definition while still maintaining the notion that pre-marital sex is not morally wrong, it would have to be morally right to play Russian Roullette, considering the game is only dealing with potential harm.Another possible definition is: Whatever has benefits that outweighs the losses, possible or not, can be considered morally acceptable. (With the taking of a life as the most extreme loss) I like this definition, and will support it in this debate.So for my opponent to show that premarital sex is not morally wrong, he will need to do one of the following:Show how my definition of morality is flawwed.Show how premarital sex (No arguments that could be used in substitute for marital sex would work) benefits more than it would potentially lose.One of the many risks of premarital-sex is the risk of unwanted pregnancies. This is a big deal in our society, with over 40% of children being born to mothers outside of wed-lock. (1) Surely, on a universal scale, this risk outweighs the possible benefits of pre-marital sex.Conclusion If morality is defined by a benefit to risk ratio, pre-marital sex is morally wrong.

68	Sb5aef646-A6cd2aef7	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Exams should be abolished.	"I accept the challenge to this debate. I will be debating that Exams should be abolished. Best of luck to my opponent. Exams are pointless and need to be removed. I will respond to my opponent's points and present my argument directly after each point.My opponent's first point is: ""[...]exams should not be abolished as it allows students to apply the content they learnt to the questions in exams."" This is simply not true. Exams aren't needed to prove that we learned something. They aren't needed to show that students learned something. In school courses there are work pages. These are the ones that prove that students have learned something. Exams aren't needed to ask the same questions that were asked in the work pages. Why force a student to basically redo their work pages. If they received a good grade on their work pages then exams aren't needed. If they didn't receive a good grade then they need to redo the lesson, but exams are not necessary to find out the level of knowledge retained. My opponent also stated: ""Moreover, the facts they learnt may be useful and can be applied to daily lives, just like in exams but a change in the context."" Students don't need exams to learn the facts that are applied to our daily lives. Students learn the facts from reading the lessen and doing the work pages. Exams aren't need to remember the facts, students learned those when they did the lesson. For these reasons exams should be abolished, not kept. My opponent's second point is: ""[...]exams should not be abolished as it allows teachers to gather all the better students for that certain subject."" This point is clearly untrue. Teachers can gather the same information that they gather from exams from the students work pages. Exams aren't the number one thing that tells a teacher how a student is doing. The teacher can gage how they're doing from the homework they assigned. This is the same result as it is with the exam. Teachers know grades, they know who is better in the class, then they can have those better kids tutor, if they so desire, and all from the students work pages. Exams only show the same results as work pages; Therefore, they are not needed.My opponent's third point is ""[...] exams should not be abolished as it can be used to find out which subjects are the student's strength."" Again, this is all found in the homework. The teacher can completely tell which subject is a student's strongest and which is the weakest. Exams aren't needed for this either. The whole point of homework is to make sure we know it. We don't need exams to do so. My opponent said that ""[...] it can help students to ""polish"" their interest for that subject."" If a student is passionate about a subject, they don't need an exam on what they just learned to teach them something new. Instead, if they are truly passionate about it, they will go and do their own study. A student will know which subject they are passionate about they will be able to know if they should follow that path for their career. Homework indicates the strongest and weakest subjects for as student.In conclusion, since homework already does all the work that an exam does, teachers are able to find out which student is stronger where, and students are able to know their own path, exams should be abolished. Exams are only an extra add on, repeating everything a student did in their homework. For all these reasons exams should be abolished. Thank you."	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

68	S60e5d10e-A4e3e8b1e	0	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Muhammad was a sincere person	"Re: Truthfulness and Honesty:The opponent emphasizes the fact that ""he was known to be an honest and truthful person."" Then he provides a story that evidences just that, that he was KNOWN as an honest and truthful person. This does not make him honest and truthful. Those who cannot see a man's lies with assume he is honest; this assumption, however, does not make the man any more honest. When Muhammad's son Ibrihim dies, he had, indeed, ALREADY DECLARED PROPHETHOOD. He had already won the hearts and minds of those around him, proclaiming that he was a prophet, messenger of Allah. Furthermore, if Muhammad had, in fact, told the people that an eclipse signifies death, then people would have seen it as flawed, since future deaths would have corresponded with eclipses. Stating this would not have ""won the hearts and minds of people"" in the long run; rather, it would have caused controversy over his prophethood, due to likely inconsistencies. Re: Freedom from Hypocrisy and Double StandardsMuhammad certainly did not advocate treating all people the same. This will be evidenced in my later arguments. Moreover, of course Muhammad did not give into bribes from the Quraish; he was indulging in the power and responsibility of prophethood. The opponent goes on to give more references from various people about his sincerity. What could have prompted them to give such praise to him? Oh, right! They believed that he was a prophet. Of course, based on the assertion that he was a prophet, his statements are those of God. Later on, we will look into this further. Argument 1: LiesMuhammad said: ""Lying is wrong, except in three things: the lie of a man to his wife to make her content with him; a lie to an enemy, for war is deception; or a lie to settle trouble between people"" [Ahmad, 6.459. H]ALSO: ""Ibn Shihab said he did not hear that exemption was granted in anything what the people speak as lie but in three cases: in battle, for bringing reconciliation amongst persons and the narration of the words of the husband to his wife, and the narration of the words of a wife to her husband."" [Sahih Muslim 32:6303]Therefore, based on these two excerpts, he believes that lying does not necessarily have to be wrong. If he does not think that the stated exceptions are wrong, then he would have had no reason to not use them himself. And if he used these exceptions himself, then he is not a truly honest person. Based on definition, a completely honest person does not lie under any circumstances. A lying honest man is an oxymoron. ""But when Zaid had accomplished his want of her, We gave her to you as a wife, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their want of them; and Allah's command shall be performed."" [Qur'an (33:37)]Allah conveniently commanded this at the time that Muhammad had lustful feelings toward his step-daughter, Zaynab. This conflicted with local customs, but this command overturned the customs and made it permissible. Muhammad then married Zaynab and divorced her mother. ""You may put off whom you please of them, and you may take to you whom you please, and whom you desire of those whom you had separated provisionally; no blame attaches to you; this is most proper, so that their eyes may be cool and they may not grieve, and that they should be pleased"" [Qur'an (33:51)]This divine ""command"" came about after Muhammad's wives were angry because Muhammad had been sleeping with their Christian slave girl, Mary the Copt. This conveniently made Muhammad's selfish act of disloyalty to his wives allowable. ""And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess."" [Qur'an (4:24)]So, Muhammad was given ""permission from Allah"" to have sex with married slaves. Muhammad named many of Allah's commands that worked in his favor to, basically, enhance his sex life. These commands that enhanced Muhammad's sexual opportunities do not necessarily mean that Muhammad is a false prophet... But it indicates that he probably stated divine commands that were not in fact divine commands and simply favored him. Argument 2: Double standards Muhammad said: ""O womenfolk, you should give charity and ask much forgiveness for I saw you in bulk amongst the dwellers of Hell. A wise lady among them said: Why is it, Messenger of Allah, that our folk is in bulk in Hell? Upon this the Holy Prophet observed: You curse too much and are ungrateful to your spouses. I have seen none lacking in common sense and failing in religion but (at the same time) robbing the wisdom of the wise, besides you. Upon this the woman remarked: What is wrong with our common sense and with religion? He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Your lack of common sense (can be well judged from the fact) that the evidence of two women is equal to one man, that is a proof of the lack of common sense."" [Sahih Muslim, Abdul Hamid Siddiqi, tr., Number 142.]Muhammad said: ""Isn’t the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?"" The women said: ""Yes."" He said: ""This is because of the deficiency of her mind."" [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Dr. Muhammad Matraji, tr., Number 2658.]Conclusion: Muhammad believed women were subordinates intellectually. Muhammad said: ""O women! Give to charity, for I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-Fire were women."" The women asked, ""O Allah’s Apostle! What is the reason for it?"" He said: ""O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious man astray."" [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Dr. Muhammad Matraji, tr. (New Delhi: Islamic Book Service, 2002), Number 1052Conclusion: Muhammad believes that a majority of Hell is reserved for women. ""I entered the mosque and saw Abu Khudri and sat beside him and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu said, 'We went out with Allah's messenger for the Ghazwa (attack upon) Banu Mustaliq and we received captives from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on us and we loved to do coitus interruptus. So when we intended to do coitus interruptus we said 'How can we do coitus interruptus without asking Allah's messenger while he is present among us?"" We asked (him) about it and he said ""It is better for you not to do so, for if any soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist.'"" [Hadith, Vol. 5-#459]Conclusion: Muhammad did not say to not rape of female prisoners of war. Rather, he said to not perform coitus interruptus and to complete the sexual act. This is clearly indicative of double standards... female prisoners of war can be raped, but other females cannot be raped. Let it be noted that slaves under Muhammad had limited rights. They would have to marry the master if the master wills it [Malik ibn Anas, vol. 2, page 155], slaves could not choose their own mates for marriage [Ibn Hazm, vol. 6, part 9], and Slaves are as helpless before their masters as idols are before God [Sura 16:77]. ---In conclusion, Muhammad was not a sincere, honest person. It is clearly evident that he had double standards and that he was not completely honest. The resolution is deemed null."	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	Sd80c4d18-A55fb5e3b	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	AIS intersex people prove that God does not condemn gay marriage	"To open his final round, my opponent claims to have cited his claim on translations - unfortunately, he has not. He has cited words, but he has not sourced what Hebrew version he is using in any of these verses. Voters need to take this into account. To refute his claim, however, in the Halakha - the body of Jewish law[1] - homosexuality is forbidden based on the Leviticus verses.[2] In addition, the Mishneh Torah - a Hebrew translation of the Torah written by Maimonidies, one of the most well-known Torah scholars[3] - specifically forbids both male and female homosexuality and marriage in Halacha 21:8 and 21:18, using those verses in Leviticus as proof.[4] This is the same section that discusses the immorality of incest, adultery, and bestiality.[4]If my opponent's claim is correct, and the Hebrew text does not forbid them, wouldn't those who know Hebrew the most - the Jewish people - be on the forefront of correcting it, not listing it among sexual misconduct and crimes? My opponent's only response to this is that Jews 'hate gays' because they are different. Never mind that, assuming his is correct, ignoring this would be twisting and changing what they perceive as the literal commandment of God. The Jewish people might be able to tolerate that (after all, the Bible notes many times where they turned away from God's law), but rabbis? I doubt it. The logic just doesn't make sense - it's all assumptions on my opponent's part, and you know what they say about assumptions.Next, my opponent attempts to argue that the Word of God does not change but his laws do and the OT laws are abolished. He does this by making several bizarre claims: among them, he quotes part of the Bible that says Jesus did not abolish the OT law, and then argues that since the law was abolished (even though he established that it wasn't), homosexuality is OK. Never mind all those pesky NT verses that establish marriage as one man, one woman, or those that condemn homosexuality.After this, my opponent claims that Romans does not condemn 'loving homosexual relationships' because it 'isn't sinful'. This is utter garbage because I have already established homosexuality is a sin according to the Bible, and Romans 1 does indeed condemn homosexuals (""For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another: men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."") He then claims that I am supposed to prove that homosexuality in every situation is sinful. For the umpteenth time, my opponent attempts to change the debate resolution: nowhere in this debate was I supposed to prove homosexuality is wrong, because this is not a debate on homosexuality. It is a debate on whether or not AIS intersex individuals prove God endorses gay marriage. What does the morality of gay sex have to do with AIS intersex people proving God's stance on gay marriage? The fact of the matter is, it doesn't.Next, my opponent commits a straw man fallacy by falsely defining my argument. He says ""my opponent has not shown how he reconciles the Bible with the AIS condition. He has not explained how we are to determine our sexual orientation if it is not done by our gender. If we have 2 genders, what are we to do?"". Aside from having no standing on gay marriage (my opponent hasn't even bothered to establish why the existence of AIS people proves God supports gay marriage), this is a blatant lie because in round 1 I clearly stated that there are numerous alternatives: for example, there could be a religious exemption for these individuals (something I clearly established has precedent in the Torah and Koran), they could be called to celibacy (something my opponent has assaulted me on, but has never proven why it isn't a viable option), or there could be no God. My opponent is trying to pigeonhole me into a position I have not taken and is ignoring key points of my argument. Add onto that his false claim that he defined 'God' in the first round and this establishes my opponent is being deceptive in his debate tactics. From there he claims that he believes the Bible isn't the word of God (despite him continually quoting in, the debate by his own retroactive definition being dependent on it). Then, he claims there is ""no way"" to reconcile the Bible with AIS. Well, guess what - I already have. Multiple times. You've just ignored all of them because you can't handle the truth.Next, my opponent has defined the word 'just' to give his definition of a 'just God'. Naturally, he doesn't explain how it is unjust for AIS individuals to have a religious exemption or be celibate - he already ignored the first and ranted about the last.After this, my opponent once again gives his three questions. These questions are designed to ignore my debate points: for example, question 1 has already been superseded by me suggesting AIS individuals could have a religious exemption. My opponent has never bothered to debate this argument (and probably can't effectively do so), so he designs the question to ignore it. The second question is just as deceptive: he's claiming intersex people are born with 'both genders' (they aren't), acts like my 'entire argument' is based on gender (it's not). Once again, my opponent creates a big straw man and ignores my actual point. My argument has actually not even addressed the topic of gender at all but my opponent's acts like it is all I talk about. He claims God is 'just', but never explains why it would be unjust under God's law for AIS people to remain celibate. He's explained why he thinks it is wrong, but never establishes why God thinks it is wrong, and that's a big distinction. Question 3 isn't even worth answering because it has nothing to do with the debate premise.After literally re-posting his entire first round argument (easy to do because it is short and shallow), he claims it is 'offensive' for me to accuse him of ranting. Given the definition of rant is to "" speak or shout at length in a wild, impassioned way"" and the example sentence is ""she was still ranting about the unfairness of it all"",[5] I think describing my opponent as ranting is entirely appropriate. After all, where in this debate has he actually been focusing on the resolution? He's mostly been yelling about how wrong it would be (under his definition of wrong) for AIS people to remain celibate, claiming the Bible doesn't oppose homosexuality in contrast to its words, and accusing the evil Bible publishing companies of putting in all the stuff about homosexuality. He also claims I cannot comprehend the form of his attack (I can, and it is pretty weak) and claims I am ignorant about the Bible. That, I will leave to the voters. If you, after reading this debate, have been honestly convinced through my opponent's changing debate resolutions and definitions, poor conduct, rants on Bible manufacturers, and arguments that are contradictory, irrelevant to the debate (or both), that AIS interesex people prove God endorses gay marriage, by all means vote Pro. If you've come from this debate realizing my opponent's stance is not accurate, that there are other legitimate (and very much more sensible) options, and that my opponent never refuted any meaningful points of mine vote Con.References:1. https://en.wikipedia.org...2. https://en.wikipedia.org...3. https://en.wikipedia.org...4. https://www.chabad.org...5. http://www.oxforddictionaries.com..."

68	Sd690e276-A86a046d3	1	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Clerical Celibacy	Hi, Firstly, I sincerely apologise for forfeiting the previous round.Due to certain personal reasons, i don't think i can come online next week.I am also sorry that i won't be able to give detailed arguments due to lack of time. Next, I would like to add that a significant number of Catholic priests are married.Upto 20% of them have wives, so the claim that the catholic church has banned marriage itself for priests is de-bunked.Even in the western Catholic tradition i would like to remind you that it is merely a disciplinary decision, *not* dogma. Rebuttal #1:Exclusive Clerical Order is Not part of the Catholic teaching This is not a part of catholic dogma, so i wonder why this was brought up.The catholic church also upholds the universal priesthood of all its members, and most of its members are laity and can get married. but, the church also maintains that there is a heirarchy to this.Even in the early churches, members used to elect elders to represent and guide them.Bishops and Elders are even mentioned in the bible, and it makes sense that some people will be more religiously inclined than others. Rebuttal #2:The letter to Titus bans polygamy If married life was an absolute necessity to lead the church, then St.Paul would be undermining his own authority to be a leader of the church as he himself was celibate. Thinking about it some more,Jesus would have no authority to lead the church as he had no experience about family life too.St.Augustine, St.Jerome(who translated the bible), and most of the early desert fathers and leaders of the church who played a seminal role in the development of Christianity, had no clue about family life as they were all celibate. Tradition has been one of the driving forces of the catholic church. A mere disciplinary action enforcing this long and rich tradition cannot be wrong. I am sorry that i could post a reasonable argument for this debate due to lack of time.I am just curious to see your response though. CynicalDiogenes	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	S6ee2f7a0-Ad0e269b3	1	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Sex has nothing to do with morality.	Yes, I agree with you that at this point we have essentially resolved the debate. I agree with you on the certain points which are as following.-1. Sex is a normal moral act. 2. If a being is capable of moral/ethical processing, that being is obligated to process ethically.3. Celibacy is not a moral act at all. And yes, it is masochistic and misanthropic.3. Even if separated by it's social and biological implications, it would still,as all else have to be considered a moral act.But let me be clear. I do not say that-- Sex is amoral or immoral.Celibacy is a moral act.Sex and ethics are incompatible and irrelevant from each other.But what I wanted to say is that...... Sex is a normal moral act. However, it has no additional weightage over other moral acts of humans.Celibacy has been given extra moral weightage in Indian society.Now, although I do not wish to expand this debate any further, my view of a moral act is that...............A moral act is necessarily a social act. (Here society is always a civilized society.) Moral values are the common shared values of a society which we have to accept and follow when interacting in a social environment. And as sex (natural sexual intercourse) involves two social beings and that being social act, sex is essetially a moral act. But masturbation is not if you perform it in a room where no other person is affected by what you do even if you commit an imaginary rape with somebody.	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

The Roman Catholic Church also forbids the marriage of the same sex so this means that the Roman Catholic church is not that in favor of the 3rd sex.

It doesn't matter if driving w/o your seatbelt can cause you to get hurt and not die, or harm other people in the car. I'm saying that it should not be enforced. It should definetely be recommended by athorities and everyone should wear them, but if they don't that should be their own fault if they get hurt in an accident. It's not like DUI where you can cause damage to others on the road. When you don't wear your seatbelt you're only hurting yourself. It's like getting fined for having annonymous unprotected sex, it's dangerous because you can very likely get a sometimes deadly STD but that don't mean you can go around fining people for banging at their own consent.

68	Sb5aef646-A4c5b50c6	0	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Exams should be abolished.	"Why do you think schools have exams? Exams are a series of tests given students to check whether students are constantly recalling what they have learnt in school. Exams should not be abolished as it can be used to enable students to practice the knowledge acquired in lessons, it can serve as a guide to enable teachers to filter those who are much more capable in a certain subject and exams can be used to determine which subjects students are stronger in. Hence, with the many advantages of exams, I strongly agree that exams should not be abolished. Firstly, exams should not be abolished as it allows students to apply the content they learnt to the questions in exams. For example in the subject of History, students are supposed to read the certified textbooks in order for them to be able to answer exam questions. This evidence shows that exams allow students to use the facts appropriately to answer the exam questions. Moreover, the facts they learnt may be useful and can be applied to daily lives, just like in exams but a change in the context. Thus, exams let students to phrase out the knowledge they studied to the questions. Secondly, exams should not be abolished as it allows teachers to gather all the better students for that certain subject. For instance in Maths, educators can sort of know who the smarter people are through exams. This shows that exams can actually help teachers to spot the people who are keen in that certain subject. In addition, teachers may assign those smarter people to tutor the weaker students in a bid to improve everyone's results. Therefore, exams can assist the teachers to assemble all the better pupils in the specific subject. Lastly, exams should not be abolished as it can be used to find out which subjects are the student's strength. For example in the subject if science, some students may be passionate and talented in science so this allows them to develop their interest for science. This emphasises that exams can be served as a tool to extract the concealed talent inside a student and it can help students to ""polish"" their interest for that subject. Furthermore, when students show deep love and passion for the subject, it may coincidentally be their future career to invest more time on it. Consequently, exams can be used to indicate the strengths of a student for the subjects. In conclusion, exams should not be abolished as it allows students to apply content knowledge to questions in exams, it supports the teacher in filtering out all the more knowledgeable pupils for a certain subject and exams help students to find out their true interest in the various subjects. With the ample benefits of exams, I strongly agree that exams should not be abolished. After reading this essay, what is your next step for your impression of exams?"

"As a Bisexual and as a Christian Apologist I have had to deal first hand with the Bible and Homosexuality and has forced me to look deeper and more critically into the traditional structure of Christian marriage law. I make the case for Biblical support for homosexuality. 1. Condemning same-sex relationships is harmful to LGBT people. Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount that good trees bear good fruit (Matthew 7:15-20), But the church""s rejection of same-sex relationships has caused tremendous, Needless suffering to lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, And transgender (LGBT) people. 2. Sexual orientation is a new concept, One the Christian tradition hasn""t addressed. Many Christians draw on our faith""s traditions to shape our beliefs, But the concept of sexual orientation is new. Before recent decades, Same-sex behaviour was understood along the lines of gluttony or drunkenness""as a vice of excess anyone might be prone to""not as the expression of a sexual orientation. The Christian tradition hasn""t spoken to the modern issue of LGBT people and their relationships. 3. Celibacy is a gift, Not a mandate. The Bible honours celibacy as a good way of living""Jesus was celibate, After all""but it also makes clear that celibacy must be a voluntary choice made by those who have the gift of celibacy (1 Corinthians 7:7-9, Matthew 19:11). Requiring that all gay people remain celibate because their sexuality is ""broken"" is at odds with the Bible""s teachings on celibacy. 4. Sodom and Gomorrah involved an attempted gang rape, Not a loving relationship. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is commonly assumed to have been the result of God""s wrath against homosexuality, But the only form of same-sex behaviour described in the story is an attempted gang rape (Genesis 19:5)""nothing like the loving, Committed relationships that are widespread today. The Bible explicitly condemns Sodom for its arrogance, Inhospitality, And apathy toward the poor, But never for same-sex behaviour. 5. The prohibitions in Leviticus don""t apply to Christians. Leviticus condemns male same-sex intercourse (Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13), But the entire Old Testament law code has never applied to Christians in light of Christ""s death. Leviticus also condemns eating pork, Rabbit, Or shellfish, Cutting hair at the sides of one""s head, And having sex during a woman""s menstrual period""none of which Christians continue to observe. 6. Paul condemns same-sex lust, Not love. Like other ancient writers, Paul described the same-sex behaviour as the result of an excessive sexual desire on the part of people who could be content with opposite-sex relationships (Romans 1:26-27). He doesn""t have long-term, Loving same-sex relationships in view. And while he describes the same-sex behaviour as ""unnatural, "" he also says men having long hair goes against nature (1 Corinthians 11:14), And most Christians read that as a reference to cultural conventions. 7. The term ""homosexual"" didn""t exist until 1892. Some modern Bible translations say that ""homosexuals"" will not inherit the kingdom of God (depending on the translation of 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10), But neither the concept nor the word for people with exclusive same-sex attraction existed before the late 19th century. While the Bible rejects lustful same-sex behaviour, That isn""t close to a condemnation of all gay people and relationships. 8. Marriage is about commitment. Marriage often involves procreation, But according to the New Testament, It""s based on something deeper: a lifelong commitment to a partner. Marriage is even compared to the relationship between Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:21-33), And while the language used is opposite-sex, The core principles apply just as well to same-sex couples. 9. Human beings are relational. From the beginning of Genesis, Human beings are described as having a need for relationship, Just as God himself is relational (Genesis 1:26-27, 2:18). Sexuality is a core part of what it means to be a relational person and to condemn LGBT people""s sexuality outright damages their ability to be in a relationship with all people""and with God. 10. Faithful Christians are already embracing LGBTQ members of the church. From denominations like the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Presbyterian Church (USA) to increasing numbers of evangelical churches across the country, Christians across the country are already putting their commitment to LGBT equality in action.

68	S942032ea-Aec65fb63	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	celibacy	"Premise 1: society is as strong as its weakest members Premise 2: these members will be irresponsible when dealing with matters of sex I will correct my opponent's confusingly worded and highly derogatory conclusion:They (weakest members of society; Couples giving birth out of wed-lock) account for 40% of births. I will try to put things into perspective. 69% of unplanned pregnancies occur to unmarried women while 31% of unintended pregnancies occur to married women[1]. As there were 3 million unintended pregnancies in 2001, which was the most recent year in which adequate information was available [1], this means there were almost a million unplanned pregnancies to married women. Now according to my opponents risk to benefits scenario, this would mean that sex during marriage is also unacceptable if the couple is not planning to have a baby. Now another misleading statistic produced by my opponent. He says there are 11.6 million out of wed-lock single parents in the U.S. This infers that all these single parents are the result of pre-marital sex. whereas if you take into account that 1 in 2 children will see their parents divorce and half of these kids will also see the break up of a parent's second marriage[2], we see things now a little clearer. It is not just that single parents are the result of pre-marital conception, but also the failure of a marriage and consequential divorce. So now we see that marriages can also produce the negative child-rearing circumstances that my opponent has portrayed, along with the emotional trauma of a divorce. To use my opponent's suggestion that society is only as strong as its (morally) weakest members; (and) these members will be irresponsible when dealing with matters of sex, the necessary conclusion is that sex is wrong during marriage as well, unless they are planning to have a child from the act of sex and they are 100% committed to the relationship during the course of raising a child. But my opponent's premise that society is only as strong as its (morally) weakest members interferes with my conclusion as they may not be trusted to remain together for the entire time of the raising of the child. Therefore, I re-conclude that sex, according to my opponent's premises, may be wrong full stop. And to correct my opponent's assumption made earlier, I did not say that pre-marital births were from couples preparing to get married, I said ""An out of wed-lock couple may still have desired and been fully prepared for the arrival of a child."" My conclusion from this round of my argument is that irresponsibility lies not only in the pre-marital scene but also in marriage. Therefore nullifying the argument that pre-marital sex is wrong due to irresponsibility because, as my opponent argues that marriage is the only right context for sex as married couples contain only sexually responsible people and I have proved that sexual irresponsibility exists quite thoroughly in the marriage context as well, it thus follows that his argument contradicts itself and holds little weight.

68	Sd690e276-A8e0f8f27	2	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Clerical Celibacy	"Hello again TrueScotsman, I will be arguing that priestly celibacy as a disciplinary action is both beneficial for one's spritual progress, and it's implementation as a *disciplinary* measure is consistent with the bible. Since you are christian,I will also put forward some arguments about the special role that priests have in today's society, and how marriage would prevent them from fully playing that role. 1.Priests must inspire the laity to look beyond base urges and into the spiritual In a society that is completely saturated with unrestricted sex today, celibate priests are living proof that sexual urges can be controlled and channeled in a positive way.Priests have a responsibility to show others that humans are much more that animals following base impulses to procreate, and should inspire people to live morally upright lives.The priest is a representative of Christ, and must seek to imitate him in every way.Jesus was a man who lived His life in perfect chastity and dedication to God.A disciplinary decision to enforce this cannot be wrong. The priest is also someone who is technically married to the church, and a celibate priest would be the perfect example for marital fidelity.Christians are called to understand marriage as the inviolable commitment of a husband and wife to love and honor one another. A priest offers up a similar commitment of love to the Church, a bond that cannot be broken and that is treated with the same gravity and respect as in marriage. Just as marriage is the total gift of self to another, the priesthood requires the total gift of self to the Church. A priest's first duty is to his flock, while a husband's first duty is to his wife. Obviously, these two roles will often conflict, as St. Paul noted and as many married priests will tell you. A celibate priest is able to give his undivided attention to his parishioners without the added responsibility of caring for his own family. They are able to pick up and go whenever necessary, whether this involves moving to a new parish or responding to a late-night crisis. Celibate priests are better able to respond to these frequent changes and demands on their time and attention. This is especially true in the case of Catholic church which has churches in many countries. 2.Clerical celibacy is both historically and biblically supported. The Catholic church would be wrong if it upheld celibacy as an *absolute* necessity for priesthood and if it said that clerical celibacy was a rule laid down by Christ. But it does *none* of these things.It merely has made celibacy a requirement due to the overwhelming preference shown for celibacy in the bible, as well as a long and rich apostolic tradition of celibacy right from the very beginning . Jesus Himself speaks of celibacy in Matthew 19:11-12: ""Not all can accept this word, but only those to whom it is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of God. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it."" Again, the emphasis is on the special nature of celibacy, one for which not all men are suited, but one that nevertheless gives glory to ""the kingdom of God."" St.Paul, whom many will quote to support marriage of priests, himself was celibate, and was clearly for clerical celibacy. ""Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage. . . . Those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. . . . The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord; but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided"" 1Cor7:27-34. Even when marriage was seemingly supported in the Bible, it was made clear that it was only as an *indulgence* and *tolerated* when there was no other choice.Historically, most of the early apostles were celibate, as were the desert fathers and the first saints of the church including St. Augustine, St. Cyril, and St. Jerome. Also, most decisions taken by the church are taken after rigorous discussion in ecumenical councils, unless there was overwhelming support for clerical celibacy it could never have become dogma.The earliest legislation passed in the Spanish Council of Elvira (between 295 and 302) and the First Council of Aries (314), a kind of general council of the West, both talk of clerical celibacy not as introducing a new rule but rather maintaining a previously established tradition. Perhaps the best support for celibacy comes from the fact that Jesus himself followed it! There is a near universal support for the spiritual benefits of celibacy.It is recommended and required by scriptures in diverse traditions such as Hinduism,Buddhism,Jainism etc.Even pagan philosophers such as Socrates and Diogenes were celibate.Celibacy forces one to be constantly aware of one's thoughts and hence requires constant mindfulness and equanimity,both are which are vital for spiritual growth. 3.The actions of a few sinners calls for more discipline,not indulgence Based on most of the data that is published(including the report that you gave in the earlier debate) it is evident that only a very small minority of priests actually engage in pedophilia.One can safely assume that the vast majority of the priesthood is still celibate.Stricter enforcement of discipline is needed in this case, not bowing to public pressure. Even if there is scientific proof that men will face strong sexual urges,priesthood is a special call from God, not just an ordinary job.Not everyone can represent Christ himself to the world , it is a special responsibility and needs one to go against one's natural urges to sin.How can one claim to be prepared to endure hardships for Christ if one can't even control one's base sexual urges?

68	Sd690e276-A3100e9d8	2	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	Clerical Celibacy	TrueScotsman,Fortunately I was able to allocate some time for this debate,however i doubt if i can make sufficiently detailed arguments due to a lack of time.Debating with you has been pure fun, and i would like to have a similar debate with you after the 1st week of December when i will have more time.I am making this merely to avoid a complete forfeit and to conclude it properly.Rebuttal#1:The Catholic church believes in the Universal Priesthoood of all believers AlsoThe Church also acknowledges the exact same thing you posted.Every believer has access to God, and hence is a priest.I don't understand why this is even an issue.There is biblical evidence for a hierarchy of bishops,as you yourself have mentioned.This heirarchy was instituted not to intercede on behalf of the laity for God, but to guide the people and for administrative reasons, which you yourself admit is required.Hence,building such a heirarchy is not prohibited biblicallyPriests are the leaders of their respective parishes.It is their responsibility to lead and guide the parish.The priests are guided by Bishops, who are in-turn guided and represented by Cardinals in ecumenical councils, who in-turn are lead by the Pope, who represents Catholic interests to other secular governments and religious leaders.The church has decided this heirarchy for administrative reasons, as it has become much bigger than the early church.It is practically impossible to maintain consistent teaching for 1,1 billion people in the world without some sort of organisational heirarchy.Priests(leaders) usually come from different monastic orders to guide parishes, like the order of St.Benedict(OSB) and the order of Franciscan Missionaries(OFM.Cappuchin) .It makes sense that those who have dedicated their lives to folllowing scripure would make better leaders than those who are merely popular.It is the disciplinary decision of these orders that was later made into cannon law in the western tradition, to ensure these monks maintain perpetual continence.I have contended that there is a near-universal belief, even among non-christian traditions about the benifits of celibacy for spiritual growth.I have given ample biblical sources also to support this claim.#2 Your Interpretation of Titus 1:6 is incorrect.The church interprets it as prohibiting polygamous as well as re-married individuals from becoming leaders.This interpretation can be seen right from the earliest church fathers.The fact that the earliest leaders followed a certain tradition becomes very relevant, as they were among those who decided what constitutes the modern 'Bible'.Why would they do one thing and then choose a scripture that says something else, unless the correct interpretation allowed what they did?Doesn't the interpretation of the very men who decided what the Bible is carry more weightage over others like you and me 2000 years(and many translational errors)later?In the primitive Church, since a large number of Christians were adult converts (a typical example is Saint Augustine, who converted at the age of 30), it was common for a married man to be ordained priest and made bishop. However, the condition for married men to receive Holy Orders was for them, by common agreement with their wives, to cease having marital relations and start to live in continence.Something that the eastern traditions follow even today.Also,Even though the epistle may allow married men to become priests,it never prohibits men celibate men from becoming priests.St.Paul who is the author of the letter also shows a clear preference for celibacy and practiced it himself.Also, St.Paul appoints Timothy to succeed him as the leader of his church through 'the laying of hands'.Bishops are the true heirs of the Apostles, and most catholic Bishops have an unbroken chain from the very 1st apostles themselves.The bible is not the 'perfect' word of God himself, it is merely the work of men who were inspired by God.The authors of the bible were not perfect, and were ignorant of a lot of things.Thus it needs to be supplemented with the tradition of the very people who were with Christ himself, as well as the correct method to interpret it which is summarised as 'Dogma'To base your entire argument on the supposed interpretation of only 1 single verse is a really weak argument.ConclusionThus there is nothing paticularly unbiblical about the *disciplinary* decision to enforce celibacy of priests.There is a clear preference for celibacy shown in the Bible and in various traditions around the world.You have never contended any of the practical benfits of celibacy,merely shown that it is unbiblical by misinterpreting a single verse.You still have not said why your interpretaton is correct.Thank you for this debate.It was just as intersting as last time.I apologise for not being able to devote the amount of time a discussion like this deserves.I have included a site that supports why the church's interpretation is correct in the sources for further reading if you are interested.Regards,CynicalDiogenesSources:http://www.tfp.org...;	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	S2db4e8f9-A38f576d1	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	"""The minimum legal drinking age should be age 25"""	"I'd like to thank CON for a great debate. O1) Paternalism Principle The government is more rational and better at making decisions than most people. Almost all lawmakers have a college degree. Congressmen have consultants to help them understand technical details. Lawmakers debate extensively using scientific research. Lawmakers have the time to analyze risk and reward. The average person does not. Therefore the paternalism principle has merits. We are not designed to ‘analyze risk over reward for every action'. Con has the BOP to show otherwise. Adults under 25 are especially bad at this task [1]. We are designed to survive in prehistoric times, not modern times with automobiles, weapons, and drugs. Con also uses a slippery slope fallacy to state that ‘why not the government regulate our every move?' It is better to learn from one's mistake as long as the mistakes will not cause serious permanent damage. Con's examples do not fit into this category. Consuming large amounts of alcohol does. If Con truly believes in the libertarian ethics, would he allow all drugs and banish the FDA? Should school not be compulsory? a) War on Drugs Drugs are still illegal in Portugal just decriminalized. Drug trafficking is still a criminal offense, and possession is still fined. [2] Con states ""16% have used cocaine."" The key word is ""used"" not ""active users"". If one takes that into account, the number is only 2%[3] This is a much smaller number than when cocaine was used widespread[4], demonstrating the success that the war on drugs has had. Con states that ""even if Pro can prove that paternalism worked, that doesn't justify the principle's use."" Pro has made a positive affirmation without backing up his claim. How is it unjustified? b) Seatbelts Seatbelt laws are effective. 80% of Americans using a seatbelt is a great number! People still commit murders even though it is illegal. That does not mean murder should be legal. c) Helmets Con's source proves nothing. The study didn't even apply to motorcyclist. Motorcyclists are required to wear helmets in laws in some states, not bicyclist. According to an article in the Journal of Medical Associations: ""Head injury death rates based on motorcycle registrations were also lowest in states with comprehensive helmet-use laws.""[5] O2) Brain development Unless Con can debunk the study I presented, it is a safer bet for the minimum drinking age to be 25, not 21. Your source says nothing about neurons not forming, just the distance between connections. It's a very hasty assumption to assume that means the brain does not mature. C1) Alcohol impedes brain development Often if people drink, they drink more than moderation. Both personal experience and evidence demonstrates this. Still, even moderate drinking causes brain shrinkage [6]. C2) Other harms Adolescents are still below the age of 25 so my sources still stand. C3) Alcohol harms others The source I cited states in its conclusion: ""Compared with a wide range of other programs and efforts to reduce drinking among teenagers, increasing the legal age for purchase and consumption of alcohol to 21 appears to have been the most successful effort to date""[7] The issue of drunk driving is associated with alcohol consumption, since one need to consume alcohol in order to drink and drive. This is the same logic of why enriched uranium and dangerous chemical possessions are regulated. Con states there is a difference since they can only be used for weapons. This statement is false. Enriched uranium can be used for energy. Perhaps a person could be a rare metal collector. Many dangerous chemicals are regulated even if they are not used for dangerous purposes. For example, special transportation needs to be considered for chemicals that are hazardous or explosive. The fact remains that drunk driving is a problem since one cannot voluntarily become sober. This is why it is treated differently from other issues as reading and driving, which is far less common. The best way to stop this would be to stop the drinking in the first place. It would be impractical to get rid of the car, since it is necessary for transportation. Drinking is unnecessary. C4) Alcohol related crimes 60% of all homicides are attributed to alcohol.[8] Imagine how many lives could be saved if the minimization law was 25. Even if this might ‘unfairly punish' some people, these people can wait until there 25 until they can drink. Many of our laws restrict certain age groups in participating in certain activities (ex: driving, voting, sex, etc.) based on statistics conducted on these age groups. Why should alcohol be any different? ==Rebuttal== R1) Con drops this case R2) Social lives There are alternative places for social gathering. Entertainment, mall, doing an activity (ex: golfing, paintballing, etc.), restaurants, etc. There are clubs that allow people under 21 to enter. I know from personal experience. With the demand to be social, businesses will create settings for social gatherings for people under 25. People rarely drink in moderation in social gatherings and I have shown above that drinking even in moderation is unhealthy. Con does not address that people under 21 also have social lives despite a minimization law already in place. R3) Career Opportunities I am correct that those of age 25 are unlikely to enter into a prestigious business deal. The average age of a CEO is 50[9]. Considering that it takes an average of 28 years to become a CEO, it seems very unlikely for someone with only a few years of professional experience will get involved in important business deals. Con states that business deals are domestic. Businesses are increasingly global [10] If the economic could progress during the times of prohibition, the positive effect on alcohol in business is minimal. This article shows how to build business relations. There is not one mention of alcohol [11]. R4) criminal justice or public health? I've shown ample evidence that making an act illegal is not only effective, but more effective then public health campaigns. R5) calling for help There are people who do not call for help. However, this number is still low. This point is moot unless Con proves that more lives are lost by people not calling for help than the amount of lives saved by the minimal drinking age law of 1984. I've shown, through plummeting drunk driving, minimum drinking age laws has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. R6) Risky behavior Binge drinking increases after the age of 21. My source states ""Rates of binge alcohol use in 2007 were 1.5 percent among 12 or 13 year olds, 7.8 percent among 14 or 15 year olds, 19.4 percent among 16 or 17 year olds, 35.7 percent among persons aged 18 to 20, and peaked among those aged 21 to 25 at 45.9 percent""[12] R7) No refute against claim that ""rights can bet taken away if pose threat to oneself and others"". Everyone is better off, and the resolution would result in diminished harm. Even if one disagrees with the parental principle, one at least agrees that the government has the right to protect others from harm, based on social contract theory. Conclusion: Almost all of my sources are peer reviewed journal that use the scientific methods as opposed to my opponent who uses mainly anecdotal and opinions. I have shown how the parental principle is effective in saving lives. Many people unnecessarily die at the hand of alcohol. This resolution could save many lives. Any benefit alcohol has is minimal compared to the unnecessary destruction it causes. http://tinyurl.com...[1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com...

68	S54ba7e53-Ae1386ac6	1	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Catholicism is morally sound and biblically correct	"Hello,Herein I will lay out my initial opening statements and will then in my next argument provide a rebuttal for the points my opponent made in his first argument.As Pro I will be contending that 1) the Roman Catholic Church is not morally sound, and 2) that it is also not Biblically correct. In order to do this, I will not be weighing the good that the RCC does against the bad, this is a poor method for determing if it is morally sound as we would rather simply seek to show that it is not morally sound in some areas and thus could not be claimed to be wholly morally sound.Also, it is not my contention that the RCC is wholly corrupt in regards to it being Biblical, my argument will be simply to show that certain aspects of the RCC are not Biblically correct.The initial opening remarks will be all in regards to the issue of Celibate priests and child abuse.Catholic Priest Child Abuse: Since 1950 the Catholic Church has been fined 2.6 Billion dollars in regards to cases involving sexual abuse, some with over 500 victims reported in a single Diosece, such as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.[1] It is close to an epidemic in some countries and even being called the Holocaust of Ireland, where priests sexually molest and rape young boys.Is it the Church's intention to have this happen? I don't think so, but I will contend in my secondary argument that their teaching on Celibacy is directly the culprit for this rampant abuse.Roman Catholic Church on Celibacy:The historical ""discipline"" of Celibacy which is enforced upon priests perhaps dates back to the Council of Elvira in 305 AD.It is decided that marriage be altogether prohibited to bishops, priests, and deacons, or to all clerics placed in the ministry, and that they keep away from their wives and not beget children; whoever does this, shall be deprived of the honor of the clerical office.[2]This teaching is directly contradictory to that of the Bible.An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who cannot be charged with dissipation or rebellion.[3]Note that the elders of the Church are to be married, and with children as it is a qualification that this elder has demonstrated he can effectively lead his household. In 1 Timothy 4:3 Paul actually speaks against the practice of forbidding marriage.Therefore, as Celibacy was mentioned as a gift according to Jesus in Matthew 19:9-12 and that ""the who who can accept this should accept this."" It is clear that requiring celebacy of the leaders of the church is not only contrary to Paul's qualifications, but also forces men who seek to lead in the church to live a life-style they are not gifted to live in.The Catholic Church then is not only Biblically in error for it's requirement of celibacy of it's leaders, but also is found not to be morally sound in this regard.Kind Regards,TrueScotsman[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...;[2] http://faculty.cua.edu... celicacy [3] http://biblehub.com...;"	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

AIS intersex people prove that God does not condemn gay marriage	"An AIS intersex person has a vagina, female breasts, and is hormonally more female than the average female. They also have internal testicles (sometimes external, but usually internal) and their DNA is male. They do NOT have ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, or cervix. If God is against gay marriage and you believe the Bible agrees with your position, how do you sustain the contradiction in light of science? In other words, they are clearly born with male and female parts, which sex should THEY marry? Their DNA is 100% male. Outwardly, they appear female and are almost always attracted to men. If God is so caught up on our sexual orientation, and says marriage is only for male and female, what is a person with this condition to do? We know that God is a ""just"" God according to the Bible so he would not make a law or rule for one person and not another.

68	S942032ea-A1a95d7dc	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	celibacy	"Attributing unwanted pregnancies to 40% of children born to mothers outside of wed-lock infers that these babies were accidental which is a misrepresentation of that statistic. An out of wed-lock couple may still have desired and been fully prepared for the arrival of a child. My opponent's definition of morality as ""benefits outweighing the losses"" does not argue against pre-marital sex, it just says that its wrong to engage in it irresponsibly. An example of this would be to bring a baby into an unstable and unprepared environment due to unprotected sex. I am not debating this, neither am I debating that acting irresponsibly and engaging in unprotected sex doesn't incur a risk of becoming infected with sexually transmitted diseases. So the cons of sex are quite easily negated to almost nil when the participants act responsibly. And irresponsible behaviour is another debate topic all together. If you add to this that sex can be a very pleasurable and gratifying experience along with various beneficial health effects, the resulting conclusion is that it is not morally wrong. Therefore, according to my opponent's definition, It is reasonable to conclude that if two consenting adults act responsibly by practising safe sex (if a baby is undesired and/or unprepared for and to prevent STI's) they are not acting morally objectionably. It is not justified to attribute the potential risks to the act of pre-marital sex, but rather, to irresponsible sexual activity. To engage your other point on emotional trauma, I would like to remind you that we are referring to consentual and non-abusive sex."	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	S2c813efa-A97c94a4	0	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	The user known as Danielle used dishonest tactics in her same-sex parenting debate.	"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

68	S942032ea-A272f50df	0	1	Should celibacy be abolished?	celibacy	"My opponents Round 3 mostly consisted of claim dropping. I will do my best to rebute most, if not all of them.His first claim was that out of wed-lock births were mostly just people preparing to get married and decided to have children before. This sounds nice (although really unbelievable), but in the source I gave there was stated to be around 11.6 million parents in the U.S. are the single parents of one or more children. (See comments). Now, this can obviously be seen as a negative thing, as children raised by single parents often experience emotional problems and make up a majority of the 'guests' at juvenile detention centers. This is obviously a bad thing.Next, my opponent said that we are debating sex with no risk involved, and completely responsible. Actually, the only way to remove risk is to have a woman's tubes tied or a man to get a vasectomy. But that is beside the point. All in all, it is safe to say objective morality does not exist outside the realms of religion. What I am defending is the notion that if the risk outweighs the possible benefits, then we should simply consider the action morally wrong. Morals apply to society. Society is as strong as it's weakest members. Those members will be irresponsible when dealing with matters of sex. They account for 40% of out of wed-lock births. This is an obvious negative effect, and does sufficiently attribute more risk than possible gain.If my opponent really wants to debate what is alright when variables are controlled, he will find that he can justify doing pretty much anything. For instance, government prisoner executions can be considered morally justified. Of course the taking of a specific persons life is never a good thing, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. The same could be said about sterile sex; I'm sure the possible benefits of feeling good about yourself and exercising that muscle on your lower end are good benefits when there are no risks. However, risks exist for non-sterile people, and they greatly outweigh those benefits.But here arises an interesting question, ""What measures the risks in comparison to the benefits?"" But the answer is really simple. Just imagine your life without sex outside of marriage. Is it really that bad? If you really can't help yourself; get married! Then imagine a life with a child you are either going to abandon of be forced to take care of. The imagine sex again. Now you simply ask yourself was it worth the 2-45 minutes of pleasure? For me, the answer is obvious. But there is another problem here; the same could be said about driving a car. Every time you get into a car, you risk dying. Then you would end up asking yourself was driving the car worth it? Of course not. So we need to incorporate risk factors here. In driving, that risk is pretty insignifigant. In sex, however, the risk is experienced by 11.6 million out of wed-lock single parents in the US.Blah, I'm done. I turn over."	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

In Ireland in 2007 160 priests died but only nine were ordained to replace them. It is expected that the number of priests in Ireland will fall from 4758 in 2008 to 1500 by 2028.[1] As a result almost 50,000 parishes worldwide are without a priest despite the number of parishes not having risen with the increase in numbers of Catholics.[2]  The prohibition on marriage pushes some men away from the priesthood. The requirement of celibacy drastically reduces the pool from which the church can select priests and means that the church is not always getting the “best and the brightest”.

The existence of AIS intersex individuals does not in any way establish God's stance on gay marriage, any more than the existence of people born without limbs would establish God is fine with you lopping off your right arm or the existence of the black widow spider justifies spousal cannibalism.AIS intersex is, for all intesive purposes, a birth defect - that's not to be rude to people with this syndrome, it is simply stating the fact. Birth defects are abnormalities - in other words, they aren't normal in comparison to the population. Many religions take exceptions for individuals with birth defects or situations diferent than the average person - for example, in Islam the pilgramage to Mecca - the Haji - is considered mandatory for all able-bodied Muslims of financial means, but those who are not able-bodied or lack the financial means to attend are not obligated to attend,[1] while in Judaism (the basis for almost all religious opposition to gay marriage) virtually the entire Torah, except for bans on blasphemy and murder, can be overriden if following it would result in risk to human life.[2] One could easily argue that AIS intersex individuals would fall under a similar exemption, as, at the time the law was written, it would be difficult to impossible for the individual to know their true gender. Another argument one could make is these individuals are called to celibacy. Another answer could be God doesn't exist. But regardless, in no logical way does the existence of these individuals justify gay marriage, especially since the religious texts of all three major montheistic religions condemn homosexual acts and, by extension, gay marriage.

Clerical Celibacy	"Hi CynicalDiogenes,I am very glad you were able to find the time to make a response, I have really enjoyed this debate and look forward to our next engagement. :)Rebuttal #1 l Bishops,Elders and Overseers are not a Separate Form of PriesthoodThe Catholic Church has taken it upon themselves by naming these individuals and leaders to be part of an exclusive Clerical Order. When the only Priestly Order of the New Testament is that of Christ and that of the collective believers. As you yourself mentioned that these ""Priests"" don't function as the Priests I described, then there is no meaningful sense in which they are Priests.There is nothing wrong with having a leadership structure, the New Testament outlines how that should look. However, the authors were also Jewish and therefore had a Jewish understanding of the word ""Priesthood."" Which in regards to that definition, the Roman Catholic Church has been completely out of alignment to and has built a completely separate hierarchy of leadership contrary to that which was laid down by the Apostles. That all believers are Priests, and the only other order is that of our Great High Priest Jesus Christ, built upon the aforementioned texts. Elders, Bishops, etc. are only properly called Priests because they belong to the universal body.Rebuttal #2 l Interpretation Incorrect?Notice that my opponent does not provide any sources for the personal views of these texts by these men of the ""earliest Church."" Nor does he address the text specifically, but rather alludes to ""translational errors"" and then contradicts Catholic Dogma and undermines the authority of the Bible here: He said:""The bible is not the 'perfect' word of God himself, it is merely the work of men who were inspired by God.""Catholic Dogma Says:""Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in writing under the breath of the Holy Spirit.""[1]""God is the author of Sacred Scripture. ""The divinely revealed realities, which are contained and presented in the text of Sacred Scripture, have been written down under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.For Holy Mother Church, relying on the faith of the apostolic age, accepts as sacred and canonical the books of the Old and the New Testaments, whole and entire, with all their parts, on the grounds that, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their author, and have been handed on as such to the Church herself.""[3]I will also now demonstrate how ""Husband of one Wife"" is the proper translation of these two texts (you keep alluding to there being only one for some reason).The Greek is mias (μιας) (one) gunaikos (γυναικος) (woman) andra (O36;νδρα) (man), the Greek word for man is not O36;νθρωπος, which is the most common. Rather it is the generic term for man, which if the thought was literally translated into English, it would be, ""a one woman man,"" or, ""a man of one woman."" This denotes marriage, which is the Sacred Union taught in Scripture where the man devotes himself to one woman for the rest of his life, and therefore Husband and Wife is supplied in English Translations. The Picture of solitary devotion is thus in play, but so is the fact that this solitary union must exist! If the Bishop/Overseer must be irreproachable, he must also in the ensuing clause be a husband solely devoted to one woman, which is she that he takes as his wife.As mentioned earlier, this intrepretation is further supported by the fact additional qualifications are listed to manage one's household well and keep your children submissive. Please also note, that these qualifications are listed not once but twice by Paul. It is also improper to appeal to Paul or the other Apostles as not fulfilling this qualification as Apostles are not stationary overseers like a Bishop. This is the Greek definition of an apostle.53.74 O36;πa2;στολοςa, ου m: one who fulfills the role of being a special messenger[4]Concluding Statements:Appealing to early interpreters of the Bible, without providing their interpretations and also misrepresenting this information as Augustine of Hippo came in the 4th Century. I am appealing to the writings of the Apostle Paul of the 1st Century and am doing so from the Greek text which I myself can read and translate effectively. In order for my opponent to undermind my argument he must go on to deny stronger dogmas of the Catholic Church, which I noted above spoke of how these words though spoken through Paul were authored by God.If this were an extended debate as was originally intended, I would have addressed the practical ""benefits"" of a celibate leadership. However, as your time was constrained I kept it confined to these two arguments.Look forward to our next debate!Kind Regards,TrueScotsman[1] http://www.vatican.va...[2] http://www.vatican.va...;[3] Louw, J.

Principles should be maintained even when it is convenient to change them	The Catholic church should not bend its principles for the sake of expediency. Many more issues divide Roman Catholicism from other churches (e.g. the authority of the Pope, the nature of the sacrament, even the wording of the creed). If the church accepted this change for the sake of convenience, where would it stop? Should women also be allowed to become priests? What about practising homosexuals? More likely such a compromise would see a further split in the church, as those who upheld traditional Catholic teaching rejected the change. Look how the Episcopal (Anglican) church is falling apart over the ordination of gay priests and women bishops, including some bishops leaving the Anglican for Catholic Church.[1] In any case, allowing priests to marry would undoubtedly lead to a two-class priesthood, with many good Catholics continuing to feel that clergy who continue to choose celibacy are superior to those who reject it. That would hardly be a healthy development for the unity of the church or for the authority of the priesthood.

68	S942032ea-Ac662c1b1	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	celibacy	Hello, thanks for accepting. Yes, I'm against the notion that pre-marital sex is wrong. For curiosity's sake, are you sincerely against pre-marital sex? Firstly, I will acknowledge that pre-marital sex has been considered taboo or sinful by many different cultures for a long time. Sex used to necessarily mean the possibility of conception, which adds layers of complication for a woman before and during the mid 20th century. But as technology developed means were invented of eliminating this possibility if one so chose. Thus sex now does not inherently carry with it the responsibility of possible conception and so we see the blossoming of female sexuality. So now the issue is solely about the 'sharing' of one's sex with another. Without getting in depth, in a theological sense sex is considered extremely precious and a mystery which is only properly experienced in a marriage context[1]. If it is pre-marital it is considered a violation of one's body or a prostitution of one's self. In this debate, I will argue that there is no moral evidence for this point of view and that it should not be dictated as a moral fact. 1. Sex can be equally as important or 'precious' outside of a marriage contract. 2. It is the right of the person to experience sex with another consensual partner how so ever they choose, dictating to another the 'proper' way to express themselves is not embracing and respecting of others values and perspectives. 3. There is no evidence to suggest that one's body is 'violated' by pre-marital sex any more than sex in marriage. Emotionally there may be the same feelings involved during and after as a couple in a marriage situation. 4. Prostituting oneself is an emotive phrase attributing low self respect and low self esteem to, in particular, a woman participating in pre-marital sex. It is an acutely derogative term and insults self-respecting women's free choice to have sex. [1]http://www.theologian.org.uk...	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

68	S54ba7e53-Af2bacfba	1	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Catholicism is morally sound and biblically correct	"Hi,I thank my opponent for this engaging and enlightening debate and appreciate the logical arguments he has made throughout.Nevertheless I hope I can adequately address all of the issues he raised in this round.Your argument can be summmed up with the words:' the enforcement of Celibacy for members of the Roman Catholic Priesthood is 1) unbiblical and 2) immoral due to the fact that it goes against the clear biblical teachings of the Apostles and also constrains men not properly equipped to live Celibate lives and thus propounds the rampant abuse.'Firstly,I need to address the myth that the media has promoted about *rampant* abuse in the church.Con says:""According to the John Jay report in 2004, there have been 10,667 reported victims in the USA since 1950. Of the allegations, 4,392 Priests had allegations lodged against them and 1,872 were actually substantiated.This of course does not even take into account the number of unreported cases there are likely only 30% of sexual abuses cases that end up being reported."" and uses this data to substantiate his claim that child abuse is something rampant in Catholicism.""However,when one reads the data carefully, 3 things become evident:1.Only about 42% of the claims were actually substantiated, thus a large number of the reports could have been false.2.Even if all 4,392 priests were guilty, there are over 410,000 ordained priests in the RCC.Thus only about 1% of priests have even been accused in the 1st place.To call an organisation as a whole immoral because 1% of its members did something that the organisation itself does not promote is just plain unfair.3.There are over 78.2 million catholics in the US alone. The 10,667 reported victims form only about 0.001%.In contrast, rape prevalence among women in the U.S. (the percentage of women who experienced rape at least once in their lifetime so far) is in the range of 15%–20%.How can Con claim that there is *rampant* abuse, when only about 1% of the clergy have been accused,and less than .001% of the church were victimised.Please note that I am *not* saying that this is all right, nor am I defending the actions of the priests.What the priests did was wrong and they deserve the severest of punishments.I am also *not* saying that 10,667 is a small number that can be ignored. I am merely demonstrating,using data that can himself has provided that this abuse is not as rampant as Con is making it appear.Now that it has been cleared up, I will address the other points raised by Con.1.Con asserts that the church is unbiblical in enforcing celibacy on its priesthood.This would be true if the church upheld that celibacy was *absolutely* necessary to become a priest and upheld it as a teaching from Christ.However, this is not the case, as Con himself agrees that the enforcement of celibacy was a *disciplinary* decision of the Western Catholic Church alone.The fact that there are exeptions to this rule, such as the existance of eastern catholic rites that allow marriage for priests and the fact that converted priests who were already married can still have priesthood in the RCC is relevant.The biblical verses I gave showed how this disciplinary decision is actually following the teachings of Christ and the early christians in *spirit* as they all felt that celibacy was beneficial for spiritual progress.The fact that Christ,St.Paul and most of the apostles were unmarried further validates the Church's claim that celibacy is a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and humanity.The fact that St.Peter the 1st Pope was married is irrelevant as this disciplinary decision was taken much later, so members of the early church were not bound to it.Furthermore, the church can reverse this decision at anytime as it is not a part of Dogma.2.Con also seems to claim that priesthood is compulsory in the Church when he says it ""constrains men not properly equipped to live Celibate lives "".This is not true, as one can simply become a member of the eastern Catholic churches if one wishes to marry and become a priest.Priesthood in the western rites is also not compulsory, so if men were really burning with desire for sex, and choose sex over service to God, one can simply leave the Clergy, and become a Lay member who can continue to be an active member of the church through organisations like Opus Dei.Priesthood is a special call from God, and is not a mere profession.One does not need to be a priest to achieve salvation, not does becoming aa priest ensure better chances.3.There are many countries following different religions where the members of the priesthood are required to be celibate, but have no problems of child abuse.If there is a truly 'scientific' reason for enforced celibacy to make men abuse children, Con must also explain why this abuse is not prevalent in other countries like Buddhist Thailand,Tibet,Cambodia and Vietnam where buddhists monks are required to be celibate by religious Law, unlike in the RCC.4.Con has not refuted the Church's authority to make this decision, nor has he given any counter arguments to undermine my claim that the RCC is the only true church to be the final authority on the correct interpretation of the Bible.In conclusion, all the claims of Con stand refuted by things that Con himself agrees to:1.The claim for *rampant* abuse is refuted when one sees the data(that Con himself has provided) from the perspective of the Church as a whole.2.the claim that it is Unbiblical is refuted when one sees that the church is not imposing celibacy on all its clergy and holding it as a prerequisite for priestshood, but merely imposing a *disciplinary* decision that is in accordance with many of the verses in the bible and in the footsteps of Jesus and the earlly Apostles.3.The claim that enforced celibacy(which is actually optional in the RCC) somehow causes men to abuse children is yet to be substantiated by Con, but i am curious to know why it has not happened in the case of not just Buddhism in the East, but also with various other religions.Thus one can conclude that the Dogma of the Catholic Church,is morally sound, and inspired by and in accordance with the teachings of the Bible.I strongly urge readers to vote for Pro.I thank Con once again for the debate and wish him best of Luck!"

68	S54ba7e53-A6d6cdad1	1	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Catholicism is morally sound and biblically correct	"Hello again,Appreciate your detailed response and am curious as to how this debate will end up!First I would like to address my opponent's assertion that I am either misunderstanding his criteria or am willfully ignoring it. I believe this debate would become very muddled were I to try and present an independent moral system, therefore I am appealing to 1) the morality outlined within the Bible, and 2) the morality outlined in the Catholic Church itself.Rebuttal #1:You said:""The child abuse is *not* part of either the dogmatic constitution or the catechism, but is the action of errant priests.Catholics around the world see this as wrong and this is in direct violation of the catholic church's stand on homosexuality and sexual relationships.This weak argument inspite of my clear definition of catholicism and clear warnings that such statements would be considered as an attempt to sidetrack the debate is unfortunate.""If my opponent will look closely at my remarks, I never once asserted that the Catholic Church supports child abuse as a dogma. It is rather my contention that the enforcement of Celibacy for members of the Roman Catholic Priesthood is 1) unbiblical and 2) immoral due to the fact that it goes against the clear biblical teachings of the Apostles and also constrains men not properly equipped to live Celibate lives and thus propounds the rampant abuse.Rebuttal #2:It appears my opponent is claiming that there have only been 40 Catholic Priests that have ever been caught, and that this notion refutes the rampancy I am proposing. According to the John Jay report in 2004, there have been 10,667 reported victims in the USA since 1950. Of the allegations, 4,392 Priests had allegations lodged against them and 1,872 were actually substantiated.[1] This of course does not even take into account the number of unreported cases there are likely only 30% of sexual abuses cases that end up being reported.[2] Where Pro gets the idea that only 40 priests have ever been caught is unknown as he cites no sources to document this, but my statistics sufficiently should refute the notion that child abuse isn't rampant in the Catholic Church.Rebuttal #3:You said:""This is more in accordance with the criteria set.Con himself agrees that celibacy is not an absolute necessity for priesthood in Catholicism, but is only a 'disciplinary' decision that is binding on members following the *Western* Catholic rites.In general, the Eastern Catholic Churches allow ordination of married men as priests.""The Code of Canon Law states the following:Can. 277 §1. Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and humanity.[3]The Canon Law is in basic terms the legal system of the Catholic Church, and therefore legally binding on all of it's structures. According to Canon 277, Priests (Clerics) are legally bound to observe celibacy, and therefore according to the law of the Roman Catholic Church it must be understood that one must within the Western Tradition (the one that adheres to this particular Canon Law) be celibate. Exceptions to this rule such as Eastern Catholic Churches or Converted Protestant Ministers misses the general point I am making which is that within the Western Catholic Tradition (the one we are surrounded by) one MUST be celibate in order to become a priest.Rebuttal #4:In this rebuttal I will attempting to refute your Scriptural support for Priestly Celibacy. You said: """"All men take not this word:there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs, for the kingdom of heaven""-Matthew 19:12 is mentioned by con.this Statement is made by Jesus Chist himself(a higher authority than St.Paul by virtue of being the Son of GOD and one with the LORD) and shows explicitly that celibacy is preferred over married life.""This statement of yours seems to imply a few things 1) by pointing out that Jesus is a higher authority than Paul is, you seem to imply that they are somehow in a disagreement, 2) you also seem to imply that Jesus' statement here demonstrates a preference on his part for celibacy. These implications are most troubling.You said:""St.Paul clearly states that marriage is prefered over celibacy and allows marriage only in exeptional cases where the priest was already married or as an indulgence.""Paul clearly gives his OPINION on the matter, stating that, ""I give my judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.""[4] He gives his reasoning for why Christians in the Corinthian Church(no indication is made towards some kind of clerical organization here) should remain unmarried and dedicated to the Lord as he is, versus getting married. There is no mention of ""exceptional cases,"" but rather those who desire to marry and burn with passion should get married (which is just about everyone) and does not in any way exclude those who might serve as the leadership of the Church.[5] Your attempt to paint a picture that Paul opposed marriage, draws an inaccurate picture of Paul's theolgy as he often speaks of it as a qualification for elders as well as a picture of Christ's sacrificial love for the Church.[6]The most notable objection of yours is that of Titus 1:6, in which you state:""These orders were given to allow already married men the chance to become priests, and mainly to prohibit polygamous and immoral members from entering the church, or holding positions of authority, as is evident from the next verse""Notice, how my opponent infers Paul's own reasoning on this regard presupposing that it was the early Church's initial stance to only have celibates be priests... or that there was an organized priesthood at all. Peter's beliefs were that of a priesthood of believers, rather than an organizational element within the Church like that of the RCC.[7] Here are a few examples of Paul's qualifications on the matter as well as evidence against my opponent's contention:1. the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. Titus 1:6- Note Paul presupposes here that Elder must be ""the husband of one wife."" This doesn't seem like an allowance of married men to become priests (which is something the western tradition forbids remember..), but a qualification that the Elder must be married.2. Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife.. 1 Timothy 3:2- Again Paul says that they must 1) be above reproach and 2) be the husband of one wife. It must be noted that NO WHERE does Paul say that the leaders of the Church must or should be Celibate, instead he says they must be married to one women and manage their children well.3. ""And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf."" Luke 4:38 ""Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?""- From these two verses we learn that Peter (Simon, Cephas as he is often named) your supposed first Pope (who would have been forbidden to be married) was actually married. As he 1) had a mother-in-law, and 2) had a believing wife that he took along with him. As well as did other apostels and brothers of Jesus.In my last post (due to time) I will outline my argument on how forced Celibacy can be dangerous from a scientific perspective.Kind Regards,TrueScotsman[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...[2] http://www.oneinfourusa.org...[3] http://www.vatican.va...[4] 1 Corinthians 7:25(ESV)[5] 1 Corinthains 7:9, 36[6] Ephesians 5:25-33[7] 1 Peter 2:9"	CON	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish
68	S63231d0a-Ac82b30f7	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Gay Marriage I	When looking through my opponent's case, it isn't so much a case as much as it is an iteration as to what the burdens of my case are. I need to explain why marriage should be recognized in the first place with reasoning that allows for gay couples to be able to enter, and when going through his case, there are several things wrong with the reasoning therein.Reproduction: One of the things that puzzled me about my opponent's logic is where he transitions between humans having the lack of ability to reproduce at an individual level and him proposing that government should condone a unit that would compensate for this. My opponent states himself that two individuals can come in at any time and commence in the act that leads toward reproduction, but he states that this is not a solution with absolutely no reason why. This entire blank area makes the entire thesis of his case shaky at best because his premise is that marriage should compensate for this lack of ability to reproduce, but there's no warrant explaining why this needs to be compensated.Characteristics of Marriage/Gay Marriage/ Infertile Couples/People Who Don't have Sex: I put this all into one big category because it's the reasoning jumbled together in all of these main points from my opponent's case that really highlights the contradictions in my opponent's case. To reiterate, my opponent's main thesis is that marriage should compensate for the individual's lack of ability to reproduce independently, and when he outlines the characteristics of his idealized marriage and what a gay marriage is, it's come to my understanding that my opponent is trying to prove that there is no warrant for accepting gay marriage. My opponent talks about the objections that there are with infertile couples and states that his argument does not require children in a marriage, but this would mean that his entire thesis would be useless because it's dedicated toward upholding the biological function that reproduces children. If this is true, then my opponent's entire premise for being against gay marriage and upholding only heterosexual marriage is irrelevant. Not only this, but he stated himself that one of the objectives for marriage in his scenario is to raise children, and if infertile couples cannot reach this objective in his conception of marriage, they also should not be recognized under this scenario. My opponent then moves away from the argument he makes when he starts talking about people who don't have sex. He explains what a real marriage is, and beforehand states that this is what the government should accept, but then turns around and says that marriage policy is aimed at trying to recognize AS CLOSE TO real marriages as possible, meaning he's contradicted his own logic. In my opponent's logic of what constitutes a real marriage, gay marriage is not a real marriage and should not be accepted for this reason, but he states that people who have marriage not intended toward raising children (again, I emphasize, one of his key points about what constitutes a real marriage) does not constitute a real marriage, but they can still be recognized in the eyes of the government. This is a complete double-standard because it allows a leniancy toward such marriages but denies them to gay couples. In fact, my opponent even said himself that there are exceptions, but he in no way designates what these exceptions are and why they do not apply to gay couples.African Americans: For now, this argument doesn't go against his logic in any way, and it doesn't go against anything I have in my case, so for now, I'll leave it be. I'll move on to my case now.R1: When going back to my opponent's case, he himself clearly allows leniancy toward marriages that are only warranted by desire considering the contradictions in reasoning between his thesis and his justification for infertile couples and people who don't have sex, but he tries to knock down my arguments because I'm somehow trying to make an argument with the idea of a marriage based on desire. Furthermore, he states that homosexual couples are intrinsically worth less than heterosexual ones and possibly it is because they do not use their organs in the fashion that my opponent specified, but this would also mean that the infertile couples and couples practicing celibacy or safe sex would also be intrinsically worth less, but he allows leniancy for them despite the fact that their marriages also contradict his standards of what a real marriage is and what kind of marriage should be legalized. It's becoming more and more apparent that my opponent's entire case is just discriminating against homosexuals with a double-standard. My opponent talks about how the reasoning in my first contention would justify other second-class citizens. It actually MIGHT (except in the case of pedophiles, who actually harm children and intake in the immoral action of taking advantage of a child, meaning they are out of social contract). My opponent pretty much begs the question in this argument by not stating why this would be a bad thing.R2: I must've accidentally missed to put up my sources. My fault. I'll place those in the comment section before the end of this debate. My opponent also states that the Emory University study is biased but provides no reasoning as to why. If we look at history, we realize that governments beforehand have had to enforce certain moral views in order to maintain its legitimacy. From the American government's perspective, for example, the abolishment of slavery, which also had contrasting moral views. However, this is looking at a case from a practical level rather than a moral level. Social integretiy and welfare is among the responsibilities of government, and this includes the betterment of public health. At the point where my case proves that public health is benefitted, what government would be doing by allowing gay marriages is trying reach the objective of maintaining the social unit. From a moral level, both our cases inherently enforce a moral idea voluntarily or involuntarily. Denying gay marriage would also be forcing moral views about homosexual acts and legitimacy of gay relationships because this action would support the people against such relationships. At the point where both our cases could validate a moral viewpoint based on my opponent's logic and my opponent is trying to hit my case at a moral level, he would have to prove that the moral viewpoint he would be supporting with his own case is better than the moral viewpoint that I would be supporting.R3: Their money MIGHT be spent in other establishments or resources, but there's a big gray area as to how much of that money would be spent. The official measure of an economy is the GDP (or GDI, which is equal to the GDP) and it only measures the amount of goods bought in one year. Over a period of time, a gay couple might spend X amount of money, but the economy's GDP is only specific to one year. The fallacy that my opponent accuses me of only depends on the assumption that these couples have the incentive to spend within this given year. A legalization would provide that incentive to increase the spending within that given year.	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

Alan Turing Should Have Chosen Celibacy	Con says that Alan Turing in choosing celibacy would have been trying to secure for others a freedom denied to himself. However, this is not entirely true. Imagine if you will that Alan staying alive and continuing his work had resulted in the internet appearing in the 1960s. He would've been able to use it as well. And the internet would have helped people living under oppressive regimes to communicate earlier on. This could've lead to earlier democratization and the spread of political freedoms. In fact an earlier internet could've helped the gay rights movement to advance earlier. http://www.theatlantic.com... Online social networking helped gay rights activists to successfully push for legalizing gay marriage in some states in the United States. Even assuming technology still didn't advance to the point of there being an internet during his lifetime, Alan still would have produced more technological advances he could've justly felt pride in and would have been honored for. And what ever boost these gave to the economy or to national security (of Britain and her NATO allies) would've benefited him as well. Then there's also all the little pleasures of life. Good food, good conversations, good friends, plays, movies, TV shows, travel. All of these pleasures he could have legally had without risking his career. In choosing celibacy he would've been giving up only one pleasure. Taking your life means giving up every pleasure that would've otherwise been yours after that point. Con states that freedom is important. I agree that it is. Freedom is an important factor in overall social well-being. However, Turing being convicted and committing suicide did not help anyone towards freedom. At the time there likely very few people who looked upon what happened to him as a reason to fight for gay rights. While a significant number of people are making that connection in modern times these are people who already made other connections and understandings. They are people who already supported gay rights. Also had he chosen celibacy he could've still been openly gay. In doing so he would've done a lot more to promote everyone's freedoms, as opposed to just securing that freedom for himself every so often during sexual activity. But even if he had been both celibate and closeted he still would've been doing the right thing compared to risking and ultimately destroying his career and preventing himself from having the opportunity to make more contributions for the good of humanity. Another point, sexual desire is just a chemical reaction so allowing it to control you, to make you engage in sexual acts when you know the potential consequences are severely negative is not freedom. Freedom would be acknowledging the urge but not fulfilling it because you know the long-term consequences for yourself and others will be better served by not indulging it. This is not to say that people should never have sex or that everyone who has sex is enslaved by it. A moderate amount of sexual activity in and of itself is healthy. It may even be worth it in a society where you could wind up sentenced or outcast for your choice of sexual activity. If it happened you could use the experience to be an activist and educate society about how it is wrong for persecuting you, and while at the time it wouldn't have had a tremendous effect it could've helped to push the movement forward a tiny bit. But that only justifies it for either an ordinary person, or for a dedicated political activist or social scientists whose position in society would allow them to have more of an effect. Alan Turing wasn't just an ordinary person, he was a genius. He could've provided a greater benefit both to himself and to humanity as a whole by being celibate. And although there still would be considerations to be made as far as how it could effect his career and hence his contributions he could've promoted gay rights a lot more effectively by having chosen celibacy while also coming out as a celibate gay man, and would've had the bonus of promoting a greater appreciation for the common good when he explained that he was choosing to be celibate to avoid being put in a position where society would no longer allow him to contribute. Therefore it would have been the morally right thing to do to choose celibacy.	PRO	celibacy abolished	celibacy abolish

68	S87a2d0ea-A4f0fab19	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	The government should recognize same-Sex marriages	"I thank my opponent for proposing this debate, and I hope we both can understand more about this important topic.1. Government's reason to incentivize marriageFirstly, I would like to say the true reason the government incentives marriage is because it a benefit to children who are a part of these marriages. Children of intact families are better off than other family structures including divorced, single parent, step families, and more [1]. 2. Marriage Public or PrivateMy opponent claims that the state should not be involved in personal endeavors such as marriage. This is a major problem for two reasons. One, marriage isn't just a personal endeavor. Marriage serves as the basic social unit of a healthy society. The effects of marriage are numerous including better mental/physical health, stronger economically, children are better off, crime is reduced [2]. Also, you can be married without the government approval of sex partners, and two homosexuals can marry each other and commit to each other for life, but they will not get recognition in most states. Two, by saying that marriage is a personal endeavor it makes the government get out of marriage all together, in which case the government would not recognize any marriages including same-sex ones.3. Role of the GovernmentMy opponent claims that it is not the job of the U.S. Government to ensure the prevention of any hazardous disease which might be spread through sexual endeavor. However, it is the job to promote the general welfare which includes trying to prevent disease and promoting health. Which is why we have the CDC who's mission is ""to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same"" [3]. Notice, how it mentions diseases at home.4. Civil RightsThere are two problems about sexual preference being a civil right like women's suffrage. One, comparing women's suffrage to Same-Sex marriage is a poor comparison. Arguments against women's suffrage included that it would cause divisions in families, Women already have influence due to influence over men, and women who take proper care of the house hold don't have time for politics [4]. These arguments are completely different than arguments defending traditional marriage. Two, Sexual Preference does not meet the requirements for civil rights. The unifying characteristics of the protected classes within the Civil Rights Act of 1964 include (1) a history of longstanding, widespread discrimination, (2) economic disadvantage, and (3) immutable characteristics"" [5]. It might be possible that you could prove widespread discrimination, but it is nothing compared to the 1960s. We have never made Homosexuals sit at the back of the bus, or have separate schools/public areas. Next, we have economic disadvantage. A 2012 study shows that Homosexuals actually tend to have more money [6]. So, there is no economic disadvantage. Third, sexuality is not immutable. There have been many people who have changed orientation [7]. There wasn't a former woman, without surgery, so sexual preference doesn't not meet this criteria either. Concluding, sexual preference is not a civil right.5. Marriage is more than love""Mutual affection and companionship between partners is a common, although not universal, feature of marriage"" [8]. ""A core purpose of marriage is to guarantee that, insofar as possible, each child is emotionally, morally, practically, and legally affiliated with the woman and the man whose sexual union brought the child into the world."" [8] This shows that marriage is about procreation. This why the government regulates it. ""'[S]ex makes babies, society needs babies, and children need mothers and fathers.' Connecting sex, babies, and moms and dads is the social function of marriage and helps explain why the government rightly recognizes and addresses this aspect of our social lives."" [8] The procreative argument was held up in many courts [9][14] such as Baker v. Nelson [10], Jones v. Hallahan [11], Singer v. Hara [12], Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning [13]. Showing that defining marriage is constitutional. Marriage should not be extended to same-sex couples because homosexual relationships have nothing to do with procreation. Allowing gay marriage would only further shift the purpose of marriage from producing and raising children to adult gratification. Marriage should remain the union of one man and one woman because marriage is more than just love.6. Marriage Historically""Although certain aspects of the institution of marriage have varied from society to society, it has universal functions. These universal functions are: 1. Complementing nature with culture to ensure the reproductive cycle; 2. Providing children with both a mother and a father whenever possible: 3. Providing children with their biological parents whenever possible; 4. Bringing men and women together for both practical and symbolic purposes; and 5. Providing men with a stake in family and society."" [8]The Netherlands was the first country to recognize Homosexual marriages in 2001 [15].No society has established same-sex marriage as a cultural norm. Leading linguists, lawyers, philosophers, and social scientists have always understood marriage to be uniquely concerned with regulating naturally procreative relationships between men and women and providing for the nurture and care of the children who result from those relationships"" [8].7. The Slippery SlopeIf love is all that matters in marriage then other restrictions on marriage like Polygamy bans, Incest prohibitions, Age restrictions should be allowed too since all of them are able to love each other. Support for Polygamy is on the rise; according to a Gallup poll people who think Polygamy is morally acceptable has double in the last decade. [16] Also, recently a Federal Judge in Utah struck down polygamy ban as unconstitutional, and he relied on a line of reasoning utilized to impose same-sex marriage. [17] ""If the natural sexual complementary of male and female and the theoretical procreative capacity of an opposite-sex union are to be discarded as principles central to the definition of marriage, then what is left? According to the arguments of the homosexual “marriage” advocates, only love and companionship are truly necessary elements of marriage. But if that is the case, then why should other relationships that provide love, companionship, and a lifelong commitment not also be recognized as “marriages”—including relationships between adults and children, or between blood relatives, or between three or more adults? And if it violates the equal protection of the laws to deny homosexuals their first choice of marital partner, why would it not do the same to deny pedophiles, polygamists, or the incestuous the right to marry the person (or persons) of their choice?"" [18]. There is further proof corroborating these claims. Going back to the Netherlands the country that first legalize Homosexual marriage that ""the Netherlands polygamy has been legalized in all but name"" [19] In 2005 a civil union of three people were ""married"" [19]. Concluding, marriage should not be redefined because it will lead to more re-definitions of marriage.Sources[1] http://www.familystructurestudies.com...[2] http://www.foryourmarriage.org...[3] http://www.cdc.gov...[4] http://www.slate.com...[5] http://www.lc.org...[6] http://www.leagle.com...[7] http://www.voices-of-change.org...[8] http://www.scribd.com...[9] http://seattletimes.com...[10] http://gaymarriage.procon.org...[11] http://www.leagle.com...[12] http://www.leagle.com...[13] http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov...[14] http://www.frcblog.com...[15] http://www.bbc.com...[16] http://www.gallup.com...[17] http://www.nomblog.com...[18] http://downloads.frc.org...[19] http://www.brusselsjournal.com..."

68	Sf0770da-A760eca8e	0	2	Should celibacy be abolished?	Homosexual Marriage and Lifestyle: Detrimental and Not Necessarily About Equality.	"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"

55	S7e87a2f7-A6d15c09b	1	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Should more or less money be put towards funding for schools	We should weigh this debate on a utilitarian scale, so whichever side can prove benefit to more people should win. I support my view with two main arguments. Firstly, that the problem of education won't be solved by merely throwing money at it. Secondly, that spending money produces harmful tradeoffs. Firstly, throwing money at a problem won't solve it. The Daily Journal reports in 2014 (http://www.thedailyjournal.com...) that if the quality of schools in New Jersey was determined by just the amount of funding that goes into it, they would be just as good as Harvard. That same article references a school that costs 30,485 dollars in government money to educate just one child, making it a higher cost than some Ivy League universities. However, this school reported only 51% high school graduation rates, leaving almost half of the students without a high school diploma and costing local taxpayers over 1 million dollars. This shows that just because a school is getting more money does not mean that the students will become more successful. My second argument is that increasing education funding creates too many negative tradeoffs and is disadvantageous. If there were to be a spike in education funding, this money could come from taxpayers. However, as shown in the previous Daily Journal article, the money did not work and the taxpayers wasted over a million dollars. But let's examine the more likely source of funding- government mandatory spending. The Congressional Research Service finds that the Pay-As-You-Go Act, codified in 2011, mandates that spending authorized by legislation (which education falls under) must be paid under this federal statute. Given an increase in spending, the President must mandate sequestration, or cutting of other programs, in order to pay for the new program, education in this case. Under Pay-As-You-Go, the Office of Management and Budget furthers that under Pay-as-You-Go, only four very specific programs are eligible for budget cuts. The two largest of these programs are Medicare and agricultural subsidies. The harms of removing Medicare are highly alarming. This is because Medicare provides health care to over one in seven Americans. Roxanne Andrews of HCUP determined that Medicare provides for 47% of aggregate hospital costs; this means that the loss of this funding would lead to hospital bankruptcy. Because of this, the National Bureau of Economic Research concludes that for every percent decrease in Medicare, there is a .3% increase in mortality. (http://www.nber.org...) The significance of sequestering agricultural subsidies are even worse. Agricultural subsidies are a form of payment to farmers in the United States. The government gives them in order to reduce the global price of food. This makes sense, because if the farmer has a supplemental source of income, he/she will sell his/her crops at a lower price. Timothy Wise finds that an absence of of agricultural subsidies would cut agricultural production by 29 percent and exports would decrease by 41%, leading to a 13% increase in food prices across the globe. (http://www.ase.tufts.edu...). Quinn Bowman of Newshour affirms this increase in food prices would lead to 50 million people worldwide being thrown into extreme poverty because all of the family's money would be needed to be spent on food, and Mark Micheli finds this causes 208 million people to be pushed to the brink of starvation. http://mellenycisbj.weebly.com... http://divainternational.ch..., Thus, the United States Federal Government should not be spending money to improve education because the negative impacts would outweigh the positives. Not only does putting more money into education not work at all, it creates too many problems across the globe. Thank you.	CON	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce
55	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind.

"""The Buffet Rule"" Should be Implemented by the Federal Government"	"My Opponents opening arguments defends three propositions and gives support for those defenses. First Government Spending Should Not be cut to the boneSecond Progressive taxation is preferable to flat taxation. Third The Buffett Rule will aid to the end of the first point. This will be a response to these propositions and their defenses. Proposition 1 & 3 – gov’t spending should not be cut to the bone and the Buffett Rule would aid to that end.To support his first point my opponent uses the general welfare clause. I would like to re-quote it because my opponent left out an essential portion from then end.Article 1 section 8 of the constitution states""The Congress shall have the Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; "" – The article goes on to enumerate the specific things to which the general welfare clause applies. There are two things that are important to note. First, the use of semi colons instead of periods shows that the entirety of the section is actually one sentence. This establishes the context for the general welfare clause which is important because as HD pointed out, the clause does not establish a ""Congress can do anything"" precedent. In fact it specifically enumerates the things that congress CAN do, and nothing else can be extrapolated from this. To add to the 18 enumerated powers would in fact put us on a slippery slope to a “Congress can do anything” precedent. Every other argument must stop here, because even if HD can prove that the Buffett Rule can be used for some “good” these “goods” should not be within the purview of the federal gov’t and were not what the original framers intended the gov’t to do. If they had intended the federal gov’t to run schools, or offer healthcare or create a department of agriculture, it would have written it in there….they did not. The problem with the thought process is two fold. First the idea that we can take money from one class and give it to another is the same problem as with the idea of slavery. Namely that we can take one group and force them to give up the fruits of their labor for the benefit of others. Second it doesn’t help in the way it is intended. As a general rule of economics anything you subsidize you will get in surplus, and those things usually accompany a shortage of something else. An easy way to see this is food subsidies. There is an over abundance of corn, soy, wheat and sugar because of these subsidies. Because farmers are creating more of these healthier options are not as abundant as they would be absent the subsidies. This is why carrots cost more than Twinkies.However this does not stop with goods, this happens with many things. Gov’t subsidizes poor performing schools, and the number of schools that don’t perform well has increased. Gov’t subsidizes poor people through social programs and welfare and the number of poor people increases, and as a consequence, schools that perform well and rich people are in shorter supply than they would be absent those subsidies.My opponent’s other argument is that a progressive tax is fair and preferable to a flat tax. To which I say I agree. However I do not agree with how tax’s are levied now. Without arguing against the legality of income tax I will say that I don’t advocate one at all. In fact I would remove all tax’s and replace it with a consumption tax on all purchases. This would have the effect of progressively taxing the rich more than the poor. It would reduce the price of everything. The poor would be able to take home more money, and it would eliminate all tax shelters and loopholes. To close I would say that my opponent and I agree on the goodness of things like schools, however what we disagree on is the federal gov’t’s role on these “goods”. My opponent argues that if we can show that these things work in other countries then we should do them. I say, if it is not enumerated in the constitution we have no right to take other people’s money to do them and the decision should be left to the states. The federal gov’t’s roll is clear and if the reason for the Buffett Rule was to achieve one of those goals (like pay down the debt) then I would be more inclined to agree with it. But it does not, so it should not exist."	CON	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce
55	S8c55999b-Af0ac224a	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Agricultural Subsidies are a waste	"Thank you for starting this debate. ""Agricultural subsidies in the context of my debate are shown to be taxpayer dollars given to farmers so that farmers will not produce crops in the current year. The point is to lessen the supply of crops and thus increase the price, thus making them more profitable for farmers who are producing crops."" While this is true in certain contexts it is also true that subsidies are given to farmers as a cushion for when they had a bad year or when their are disasters like floods, hurricanes, or a freeze that kills the crops. The subsidies are used to control the market if their is a surplus then the farmers don't need to plant. When their are shortages then subsidies are still given to farmers so that they can plant even more. ""Farming is a negative externality because it is responsible for producing about 15 to 20 percent of global methane emissions come from livestock. John Robbins, author of The Food Revolution and Diet for a New America, says that methane is 24 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, the culprit normally at the center of global warming discussions."" I assume the word farming refers to crops my opponent equivocates crops to producing methane however as he pointed out that methane emission comes from livestock. If my opponent referred to farming as livestock then my apologies While I concede that cows are responsible for the most methane emissions that I believe is irrelevant to this debate whether agricultural subsidies are a waste. Agricultural subsidies refers to crops not livestock. ""The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that animals in the U.S. meat industry produce 61 million tons of waste each year, which is 130 times the volume of human waste produced, or five tons for every U.S. citizen. In addition to its impact on climate, hog, chicken and cow waste has polluted some 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."" I concede to this but I must point out that you are talking about industry (corporation) an entity almost completely free from gov't interference. ""If we were to stop subsidizing farming, it would become not as profitable as other industries, thus gradually those seeking to become farmers would choose different career paths and the overall number of farmers would decrease as farmers retire/die. Thus the amount of livestock and crops would lessen in number which would drive the prices of food back to an acceptable profit range that subsidization currently makes possible."" My opponent has this view that livestock are kept in farms and by decreasing the number of farmers livestock should decrease as well however that is false the number of livestock is not dependent on the number of farmers. Livestock are usually kept nearby factories unless he is talking about dairy farms; however I have dismissed this because my opponent has used the term ""livestock"" referring to domesticated animals like cows,pigs,horses,chickens, etc. SUBSIDIZING FARMING IS NECESSARY I negate that agricultural subsidies are a waste of taxpayer dollars they are in fact necessary making them the opposite of a waste. While my opponent can argue that they are a negative externality he must also ague that agricultural subsidies are in fact a waste. C1 - Arable Land - The amount of arable land has decreased in major cities every new building that is made takes away from the amount of arable land for cities with vast expanse of arable land this is not a problem. If the use of land was left up to the ""free market"" there wouldn't be food or grain left to the community. Market prices for residential and commercial land is way higher than expected earn on farm land. Because of this the gov't must offer incentive in the form of subsidies to have farmers keep and farm the land instead of selling out to development companies. I would like to expound on this point more but time is of the essence. Thank you once again for starting this debate. cordially, HPG"	CON	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce

55	S5c61ba4c-Aae7cfadd	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Subsidy reform is already taking place in many areas of the world	Farm subsidies represent little more than a highly inefficient foreign aid scheme, funded wealthy states’ tax payers. In essence, subsidies do little more than use tax revenue to reduce the price and control the production of certain agricultural goods. These goods, as has been discussed above, are then sold to the developing world at prices lower than poor states’ domestic markets can match. This is, effectively, equivalent to making payments to developing states – individuals in developing states spend less money on food under the status quo, so have more money to spend on other things.[i] This situation is problematic, firstly because it obstructs the development of developing states’ agricultural sectors. A rational system of aid giving should not create dependence or inhibit growth. Secondly, “funds” provided to developing states via subsidy schemes are also shared with wealthy first-world farmers an agribusinesses. Subsidies remain a considerable source of profit for the agricultural sector. It seems irrational to pay farmers to improve the monetary and fiscal environment in developing states, rather than allowing aid-giving states to provide money directly to underdeveloped areas. Under the status quo, first world agribusinesses do little more than add to the transaction costs of sending aid to developing economies. If the quality of roads and rail lines in a state is so poor that food deliveries are delayed, why not pay for upgrades to transport infrastructure? If both the educational institutions and the service sector of a state are underdeveloped, invest in a state’s education system and encourage partnerships with ship brokers and accountancy firms? Subsidising food in order to offset the worst effects of deprivation, marginalisation, environmental damage and retrograde or corrupt government will do nothing more than entrench the poverty that afflicts many developing nations. It will prevent states’ agricultural sectors growing or functioning competitively and it will continue to foster the dependence on western largess that contemporary development theory attempts to avoid.

Even adamant anti-subsidy advocates agree that abolishing current financial assistance will not be beneficial in the end. Reform of current subsidizing policies is better than eliminating it altogether. Small farmers are in dire need in the USA, and eliminating the percentage of their income derived from federal support would have devastating effects to the smaller American farms. Legislation that has been tabled such as the Rural America Preservation Act and the Grossley-Dorgan Bill needs to be passed. These and other policies would help by capping the amount given to the largest agricultural corporations, and fix the loopholes that allow them to receive unjust amounts of the subsidy pie. These policies will also help conservation and preservation of pristine natural resources, while keeping current farmland healthy, but not encouraging monoculture, something current subsidies do.

55	S1389f457-A7557eb43	0	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	This House believes that we should substantially subsidize the extraplanetary industry	"I want to begin by thanking Stephen_Hawkins for the debate and I would like to first address some administrative issues and then move on to my introduction and topical analysis for the resolution itself. Pursuant to PRO""s stipulation, I will present an affirmative case in the first round. Judges will note that the consequence of this will mean that I do not offer additional arguments or rebuttals in the final round. For this debate, I stipulate that the burden of proof is split necessitating that my arguments support the resolution while my opponent argues for the opposite of the resolution; that ""we should not substantially subsidize the extraplanetary industry."" My opponent""s participation in this debate henceforth should properly indicate his acceptance of a split BOP and additional provisions, accordingly. Now, I want to offer a brief sketch of my strategy for this debate. Because the resolution is isolated to address specifically the issue of the use of subsidies to a specified end, it is proper to examine why and under what circumstances governments should use subsidies. In the first round I will examine how market failures stemming from various externalities, scale and imperfect competition create conditions where the use of subsidies may produce an increase in domestic welfare, and may additionally result in other market benefits. In Round 2 I will examine market conditions within the extraplanetary industry and articulate multifaceted public benefits that may result from subsidized extraplanetary industry as defined by my opponent. In Round 3 I will rebut and conclude pursuant to the structure outlined by my opponent above. Market failures exist where ""a difference exists between the actual price and the socially optimal price.""1 Market failures may manifest in problems of scale where large fixed costs of entry into a market are necessitated by industry requirements of highly specialized capital. However, upon acquisition of capital allocated efficiently toward production the cost of production falls as units produced both increase and are sold. Because the initial cost of production is exceedingly high a market price of such a good will be disproportionately more than a similar good from an established company which has already recouped its cost of market entry. Because the demand for a marketable product whose price is disproportionately high may be artificially low, where subsidies are allocated to offset the cost of market entry demand may increase where the cost of a product is reduced. This is the hallmark of ""learning by doing"" within a specified industry. Salutarily, the allocation of subsidies to underdeveloped companies who have not recouped their cost of entry may have the dual effect of increasing demand for a product as a result of lowered consumer costs. Empirical research suggests that this is especially true for high tech industries, such as aerospace, nuclear power and semiconductors.1 By the governmental allocation of subsidies to early-stage industry, such an initial investment has exceeding potentiality of benefiting consumers in the future. For subsidies to be beneficial to developing industry, the World Trade Organization articulates that ""the losses made in the initial stages must be significant and the learning curve steep."" Moreover, in imperfectly competitive markets (which tend more to correspond with the situational reality of international trade than perfect-competition hypotheticals upon which many purely free trade economic analysis are predicated) governmental subsidization of industry may result in the strategic relationships between domestic and international firms in a manor favorable to domestic firms and in consequence domestic welfare where properly implemented, as illustrated by Spencer and Brander (1983), (1985) and Brander (1995).1,2 As Gholz (1997) explains, by capitalizing on market failures, to shift rents from successful producers, national wealth may be increased.3 While as Hortsman and Markuzen (1986) validly note, policies of industrial subsidization may run the risk of the subsidizing of inefficient producers, through proper investment of subsidies to research and development it is possible that presently inefficient domestically subsidized producers may eclipse more quickly global competition by eliminating the need to amass capital for reinvestment into research and development where (as mentioned above) the industrial learning curve is steep and the cost of production decreases precipitously as more units are sold, capital is amassed and then subsequently reinvested into research and development (R&D). Strategic Trade Theory, as modeled by Spencer and Brander (1983) incorporates a 3 stage model in which firstly subsidies purposed towards R&D and/or other measures increase domestic welfare by shifting profits from foreign firms to domestic firms. This is accomplished by increasing the cost of foreignly produced products of enabling domestically produced products to be sold at a rate lower than that of foreignly produced products. This causes foreign firms to reduce their exports and similarly causes domestic firms who enjoy subsidization to export and, moreover, sell more goods. As a result, the revenue generated by domestically subsidized firms increases while that of foreign firms decreases which will furthermore reduce foreign R&D. Simply, the gain of the domestic firm is won at the expense of foreign competition. This firstly protects the domestic industry from foreign competition during developmental stages, secondly secures the place of a domestic firm within a global economic niche and thirdly erodes the revenue potential of a foreign firm. In consequence, governments may use subsidies as mechanisms of strategic trade policy to shift profits from foreign firms to domestic firms which will reduce national economic welfare in such a way that secures a continued return on investment through future tax revenues and increased global trade. 1 http://www.wto.org... 2 Barbara Spencer and James A.

This kind of idealism and desire to make the world an equal place has already gotten us into quite a bit of trouble, ruining a large part of the world under the rule of communism. The idea that we could solve all the world’s problems through redistribution of wealth through government subsidies is not only naïve but also dangerous. Being committed to new human rights and wanting to offer help to the poor is not the same thing as imposing subsidies. Indeed, in many countries subsidies for particular activities end up favouring well-off landowners and the urban middle classes. Examples include agricultural subsidies in the EU and the USA, subsidies for power and water in rural India, and subsidies for water or Higher Education in much of Latin America. In each case the well off benefit disproportionately, while the poor end up paying via the tax system and through reduced economic growth. It would be much better to price these activities at commercial levels and to develop economic policies aimed at growth and job creation.

My opponents 1 Objection with two parts remains refutted: ""In summary we would reject a justice system that let some one go unpunished and declared innocent who is guilty of rape, torture, murder, genocide etc, by punishing a volunteered innocent in the place of the guilty, thus we should reject Penal Substitution Atonement Theory."" Refutation 1 fleshed out in my first round post: R1) Jesus is not permanently in Hell due to his Penal substitution of our sins. He is currently in Heaven and ruling. He paid a Penal substitution to atone for our sins that was equivalent but not exact and he is now ruling Heaven because of it. No injustice from God the Father has occurred to Jesus' person. **Points of note: 1st Note - If my opponent does not believe this is a part of every PSAT model viewpoint, He would need to prove that to be the case. He would need to assert a model that shows Jesus is serving our eternal punishment exactly as due. There are no PSAT advocates that do this. All viewpoints recognize the substitution was equivalent rather than exact and not permanent though our punishment was to be permanent/eternal. 2nd Note: My opponent did consent to Jesus' resurrection thus consenting that Jesus is not serving the exact sentence but an equivalent substitution penal sentence equivalently effective. Refutation 2 fleshed out in my first round post: R2) The guilty are not simply released but are forgiven when they accept the substitution and are no longer the past dead guilt ridden sinners but cleansed new individuals… attested before all of heaven by God. Needless to say my opponent's objection no longer stands. My affirmative argument points summarized Argument for PSAT: PSAT accomplishes this 1)Satisfaction of Justice must be applied for the victims both God and Man through a Penal Substitute atoning for the guilty. (amended for clarity) 2)Assurance that the guilty being forgiven and released have indeed changed. 3)People are not static and those changed guilty offenders need forgiveness. In our own Penal system we cannot have all three in fullness- Satisfaction, Assurance of Change and Forgiveness. In God's system of Justice we obtain all three. To address the accusation brought up in the last round that ""I(Gileandos) am not Arguing PSAT""; (Wikipedia and theopedia are not theological guideposts for any denomination and not sound sources, Carm though actually Christian is an independent ministry and merely posting a definition on this particular link) These three sources feel like my opponent is merely googling for definitions rather than having solid theological framework teachings that he is able to argue from. The resolution did not state PSAT as affirmed by such and such a person. It also did not state ""what Con believes to be PSAT"". There were no governing restrictions to a particular view of PSAT in the resolution. There was no assertion that mandated I hold to a Reformed View of PSAT. I am not Calvinist and I do not argue from a Calvinist viewpoint but I shall quote the famous J.I. Packer and his 1973 Lecture on The logic of Penal Substitutionary atonement. This work clarifies misconceptions, discusses the top three views of PSAT and the logic of each, and tries to place forward the Calvinist version as accurate. Clearly there was more than one view in 1973, how much more so several decades later… http://www.the-highway.com... ""First, the significance of penal substitution is not always stated as exactly as is desirable, so that the idea often gets misunderstood and caricatured by its critics; and I should like, if I can, to make such misunderstanding more difficult."" Here the author is joking/not joking but I posted this to show my audience that the subtleties of PSAT are not easily understood and can be mischaracterized just as easily. And again J.I. Packer states… ""All this, being so, it might be hard to find an account of penal substitution which could safely be taken as standard or as fully representative, and it will certainly be more straight-forward if I venture an analysis of my own."" These quotes showing that the great J.I. Packer in 1973 recognized the misunderstandings and mischaracterizations….. thus my opponents attempt to dodge the refutation of his objection by appearing to make a complex issue appear simple…. is inaccurate. I will leave my opponent to come to a more full understanding of PSAT by reading J.I. Packer's work but again I state that this is to lay out some clarities of PSAT and to reject my opponents latest assertion that somehow I am not arguing PSAT. BY formal Definition I have already stated that Jesus Christ Paid for our sins through a Substitutionary Penal process of atonement. (PSAT) **** The second work I would like to quote is the person who holds the Catholic standard view of this model and comes prior to any of the reformed viewpoints. I agree with some of the things that J.I. Packer asserts and I agree with some of the objections. I do also assert many of the things within the Catholic View of PSAT. Summa Theologica = Catholic Work by St. Thomas Aquinas This catholic work is the modern origin and launch pad of my opponents analogy laid out in the first round of Sin being a debt. He lays out the Penal Debt that needs to be paid for both divine and human justice to be satisfied. He also lays out how Jesus substitutes for our penal satisfaction. P2 Q87 A6 ""Consequently it is evident that when the sinful or injurious act has ceased there still remains the debt of punishment. "" Definition of Penal = Punishable; inflicting of punishment http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com... Thomas Aquinas lays out the base of all modern viewpoints of the PSAT Model. P2 Q87 A6,A7,A8 http://www.newadvent.org... Thomas Aquinas: P2 Q87 A6 R3 ""Moreover punishment is requisite in order to restore the equality of justice…"" To Quote St. Thomas Aquinas directly on his view of Penal (punishment) Subsitutionary Atonement. P2 Q87 A7 R3 ""Christ bore a satisfactory punishment, not for His, but for our sins."" Christ bore (took/received) a satisfactory (atonement) Punishment (penal), not for His (Jesus'), but for our Sins (substitutionary) Though Catholics like Evangelicals debate the elements within the Christological Atonement framework and its elements/variations, they all have their roots within Summa Theologica a medieval Catholic work which discusses PSAT and its objections from a Medieval perspective. This is completely a Penal Substitutionary Atonement model. The key differing elements in this Catholic View from the Reformed view are: 1)Due to this equivalent payment ""Penance"" of Christ, Penance is clear in scripture and in action and a Church doctrine for sinners. 2)There are three categorical sins, original, venial and mortal. This makes the Reformed advocates misunderstand many of the Catholic statements concerning a type of sin. 3)Reconciliation with God for the Catholic comes from our Will being in unity with His Will. 4)Christ's Merit allowed for the substitution to take place. These differences cause a bit of confusion for the theological underpinnings of a reformed advocate, as statements are easily misunderstood. A lot of the Reformed traditions vary entirely in concept and background information from a Catholic Viewpoint."	PRO	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce

55	S5c61ba4c-Ad8e127eb	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Subsidy reform is already taking place in many areas of the world	There is much about the proposition side case that smacks of orientalism. The quality of life of individuals in many of the world’s poorest states has been immeasurably improved by the ready availability of cheap western food imports.[i] The ability of western farmers to provide food at lower prices than their competitors in the developing world’s domestic market is actually driving growth and productivity among poor agricultural producers. Subsidies’ contribution to poor agricultural production in the developing world is marginal. Indeed, many of the poorest states trade with European Countries on terms as favourable as those set out in the treaties of the European Union. Under the Everything But Arms scheme, underdeveloped states can export goods to EU states without being required to pay tariffs or customs charges.[ii] Further, as noted below, changes to the CAP have now create a European subsidy regime that carefully controls production rates, punishes over production and ensures  surpluses are not “dumped” onto the export market. Under a range of partnership agreements, the EU now sources 71% of its agricultural imports from developing states.[iii] Increasing developing state’s dependence on their domestic agricultural markets is likely to increase food prices within their borders. The relative level of sophistication of developing states’ transport infrastructure and agricultural technologies is much lower than in Europe. Consequently, the cost of producing a commodity- grain, say- within a developing nation, and then transporting it to consumers will be much higher. Poorly maintained roads will increase journey times and will cause a larger proportion of stock to spoil before it can be sold. Credit and stock systems will be slow and undeveloped, impacting on the efficiency of doing business with local farmers. All of the factors listed above also affect export trade. While international travel may be a relatively fast and efficient affair, the process of moving bulky agricultural goods to ports and airports, let alone soliciting and processing orders from European importers, will prove extremely difficult for farmers in the developing world.[iv] The diversification of the food export industry envisioned by side proposition simply will not happen. Underfunding and underdevelopment of infrastructure in poorer states will not allow it. Moreover, the increased cost of transporting goods across rural areas, particularly as many of the poorest countries are cursed with being landlocked, in the subcontinent or Africa places a premium on food before it even reaches the communities that will consume it.[v] At the very least, the controlled reduction of food prices by subsidies ensures that this premium is affordable. Attempts by side proposition to imply that rural communities suffer disproportionately under the current subsidies scheme are rendered nonsensical by the observation that not all agricultural goods are staple foods. Growers of tobacco or coffee and the other forms of labour intensive export goods mentioned above are already engaged in a trade that has a great deal of developmental potential. However, requiring them to pay higher prices for domestically produced food might undermine the profits farmers make on flowers or spices.

55	S8c55999b-Afc27900b	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Agricultural Subsidies are a waste	"thank you.R1I do concur that taxpayer money is given to farmers who are paid not to plant but they are also given to farmers so they can plant more. my opponent makes an assumption and says I am making a concession to equating surplus with such an overproduction of crops that the crops themselves have no cost, I can see how he made that jump (wait no I can't). The US made a reform to farm policy in 1996 establishing a subsidy programs in which their are payments made to farmers once prices fall below a floor price aka the loan rate, which is set by our law makers (congress). My opponent is saying that these payments encourage overproduction, generating surpluses that are then dumped on the market at prices well below the cost of production. My opponent then I would say reasons that reducing subsidies would curb overproduction and boost prices. Inflation in the US is a problem even with farmers when we take a look at the farm sector over say a bunch of years (60) a few things stand out that prices have declined steadily over the sixty years and that the price decline since 1996 has been far less severe than in previous years, this suggest that their are other factors contributing to the decline. In 1998 a upsurge occurred in subsidy payments in response to falling prices, not the other way around. And prices fell not because of subsidies but remaining vestiges of supply management programs were phased out in 1996 this lead to increased competitive pressure on the supply side of the market. Overproduction refers to a situation in which current supply exceeds current demand. Excess inventories accumulate, and prices fall. If overproduction caused the longer-term price decline, we would expect to see excess inventories rising as prices fall. But inventories (in relation to usage) have remained constant or fallen for all major commodity crops (corn, rice, wheat, soy, and cotton) since the early 1980s. Thus falling prices do not appear to be caused by overproduction, either before or after the 1996 subsidies were enacted. And (with the possible exception of cotton), this data offers no compelling evidence that subsidies as such are causing stocks to rise.A business would observe another business getting to know it's competition. they tend to avoid price competition, using non-price means to increase their market share. However the farm sector is different. they will not, as a rule, respond to falling prices by taking land out of production that is, working to raise prices by limiting supply. Just the opposite: confronted with falling prices, farmers will attempt to increase output in hopes of offsetting falling per-unit revenues by a higher total volume of unit sales. Failure to do so will put them out of business sooner rather than later.So the normal operation of the market which aggregates the decisions of many individuals is for lower prices to trigger higher output, leading to even lower prices. The farmer’s imperative to cover fixed costs, and the fact that farmers generally do not coordinate their individual actions prior to bringing their goods to market, gives rise to the seeming irrationality of farmers’ responding to falling prices by trying to increase output. And since the demand for most food goods is relatively unresponsive to price, a significant decline in price may be required to clear the market of excess supply. Thus the overall price level tends consistently downwards and buyers’ expectations of what they will have to pay adjust ever downward, too.R2""Agricultural"" or ""farming"" are a general terms used to refer to things that are produced on a farm. Agricultural subsidies also go to purely dairy farms as well as farms that produce purely crops. $295 Million dollars are appropriated toward diary farms in the US. These farms produce the methane gas and water pollution that was mentioned in the opening round, thus they are relevant in the statement that agriculture can be a negative externality.""Ok so I concede that it is a negative externality how is it a waste though that's what this debate is about. And agricultural pollution is caused not by all farms or most farms but by the biggest farms the 20% of them that usually get favor to subsidies. A small farm however they devote about 17% of their land area to woodlands and keep as much of their land in soil improving uses. They maintain soil fertility on the farm which means an active interest in long term sustainability.-deadness-The process you're referring to I assume is eutrophication which their is a ""boom"" in the feed of algea (nitrates and phosphates) so they reproduce like wabbits. So algae increases and the river look reddish for a while until they die and that's bad because they are literally took up all the dissolved oxygen when they die they take the oxygen with them. While this is very sad and very bad. Why is it important to this debate? why is it at all relevant? the topic is ""Agriculutural subsidies are a waste."" Paying for something that has no benefit and is actually harmful is a waste. They are not necessary for anything and my opponent has not given even the smallest amount of evidence that they are necessary for anything."

Subsidy reform of the type proposed will undermine agricultural businesses in the developing world	Even adamant anti subsidy advocates agree that abolishing current financial assistance measures will do more harm than good. Reform of current subsidy policies would achieve more than their complete elimination. Many family farms in the US and the EU are running on extremely slim profit margins, which are squeezed by supermarkets,[i] and eliminating their subsidy payments would devastate their incomes, forcing the sale of land and the sale or slaughter of livestock. The lacunae and negligent administrative conduct that anti-subsidy campaigners claim is characteristic of the policy’s overall inefficiency are simply design flaws that appropriate legislation can correct. Both the Rural America Preservation Act[ii] and the 2002 Farm Bill[iii] offer the opportunity to remove many of these negative traits from America’s farm subsidy regime. They will cap the amount given to large, heavily capitalised agricultural corporations. These policies will also assist in encouraging the conservation and husbandry of natural resources, and ensuring the health of existing farm soil. Policy makers already recognise the perversity of paying owners of farmland large sums simply to keep the land clear and ready for agricultural use, without also monitoring Similarly, in Europe, reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy following the ratification of the Treaty of Nice in 2003 now require farmers to engage in sustainable agricultural practices. Penalties reduce the size of the subsidy available to farmers who disregard the limits imposed by the Treaty. The EU is also due to begin applying a policy of intervention pricing. Intervention pricing represents a form of dynamic subsidy. If commodity prices fall below a certain level, the EU will buy up produce in order to raise its price. This method allows the EU to reduce standard subsidy payments, which might incentivise overproduction during periods of economic stability, while allowing it to protect farmer’s incomes if market prices fall.

The farming sector will respond to profit not prices. If it becomes unprofitable to be a farmer, then people will stop becoming farmers, sell their land, and retrain in a new industry. Increasing output produces more profit. So the general effect of removing agricultural subsidies will be lower prices for the consumer and a more efficient use of the farming land that is profitable. If demand for farming products is relatively inelastic to the price (which it is not) then farming will become unprofitable and we will have less farmers which will reduce the supply in the long term.My opponent is also completely ignoring goods which are elastic to price(ethanol, soda, ice cream, etc.)""Generally they don't but as explained above every kind of business is different I'm ignoring them because they're irrelevant and because you ignored them as well ""I don't seem to see a problem, more efficient farms and lower prices for the consumer.""That's why subsidies are necessary they keep prices down. ""Paying money for a negative externality is by definition a waste of taxpayer money. Another example would be like saying the government is using your tax money to produce more pollution with no other benefit. It would be a complete waste of your money, because the government could be using that same money to build public water fountains, maintain roads. Anything that benefits the taxpayer.The governement is spending taxpayer money to pollute the rivers, streams, kill fish, boost methane content in the air, etc. This is a waste of the taxpayer dime when it could be used to do something that actually benefits the taxpayer (positive externality) or just not used in the absence of a positive externality to subsidize (less to pay in taxes) and thus be used by the taxpayer for consumption which would provide greater utility than pollution.Do you not see that from a taxpayer perspective spending tax money on something that harms the general tax payer is a waste?I have shown that Agricultural subsidies are a negative externality. My opponent has conceded this point. Negative Externalities are waste by definition. Therefore Agricultural subsidies are a waste of taxpayer money.Taxes are used (or are meant to be used) to benefit the taxpayer. If they are harming the taxpayer or not benefiting the taxpayer, then they are being wasted.""This is the point I couldn't get to last round sorry. You equate agricultural subisides with being the cause of pollution. Throughout this entire debate I have conceded that their are green house gases and that cows contribute to that eutrophication is a very bad thing however what does that have to do with agricultural subsidies with money? you have connected them at all you simply can't say that agricultural subsidies aren't a waste economically but they contribute to global warming the subsidies don't do anything except maybe kill a few trees but most of the oxygen in the worldcomes from the ocean. The gov't is giving money to farmers which in turn may pollute the earth. Your argument isn't the money given to them is a waste, your argument is the money given to the farmers which they then use to pollute the earth is a waste. A man buys a gun from a store and kills his wife should the gun be put in jail? maybe the guy who sold him the gun could be put in jail, the guy who did the killing should go to jail, but the gun didn't do anything it did what it was meant to do kill that's all. the money given via subsidies to farmers do what they are meant to do keep prices down for those who cannot afford to buy food at high prices.And a public water fountain doesn't really help people at all unless they're going to die from thirst in fact most water fountains are disease ridden. And not to mention how many people have died because of road maintanance. my opponent says the gov't are litterally using money to kill ecosystems that's false. It is a negative externality when that happens however it's the pesticides that we use to kill certain diseases in our food would my opponent have us die instead?"

55	S430a6870-Abf0b3661	0	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	The U.S. Government Should Allow the Big Three Automakers to Go Bankrupt	"With many thanks to Con for continuing this fascinating debate, I should like to reply as follows: 1. I have accepted my Pro's arguments that the unions have made the ""Big 3"" uncompetitive and I understand that the commitments the companies have made to their employees is partly the reason why they have been obliged to go cap in hand to the Government for a bailout. That said, the writing is now on the wall. The union members must accept that their employers must cut their cloth according to their means and accept a pay freeze and reduced benefits. The alternative would be to force their employers into bankruptcy. The unions and their members may be powerful, but they are not stupid. A proud car worker does not want to find himself queuing up with a behind a pack of spotty teenagers in a line for a McJob. For this reason, I believe the unions should and will work with the management to avoid the companies being taken into administration, even though Chapter 11 may still provide a way forward for the businesses. Many articles have been written about the wider effect the closure of a major employer has on the local community. Here is a recent one that deals with the subject in hand: http://www.cnn.com... It stands to reason that if a significant percentage of the population of a town is thrown onto the scrap heap when a major plant closes, they will no longer have as much cash to spend and there will be knock-on effects for local service sector businesses. Pro's point about nameplates being a financial asset in Chapters 11 and 13 is accepted and I would envisage that most would survive bankruptcy procedure. My assertion was, however, that future vehicles would be produced by foreign owners; possibly in the US, possibly abroad. Either way, it would be a severe knock to national pride and although that has no monetary value, it is still worth something to patriotic Americans. 2 The legacy costs of a buyout at this stage do mean that even if the firms were sold for a dollar each, they would still make financially unattractive investments. That is true. That is why any public bailout should, as I have said, be conditional of root and branch reform of the companies' operations, with particular regard to employee benefits and the closure of outdated product lines. Future success will only come about by developing vehicles relevant to changing market demands. My opponent did not directly address points 3 and 4 so please take them as read. 5. My opponent and I both agree that agricultural subsidies are a mistake. Whilst it is true that America will not run out of cars if the ""Big 3"" automakers go to the wall, this was not the crux of my argument. The message I was hoping to convey was that to allow them to go bust would have a severe detrimental effect on the local and national economy, together with a loss of American self-esteem. 6. Transition is a useful tool, there is no doubt about that. It is especially important when a large employer closes a plant. However, prevention is better than cure and preserving skilled jobs is both cheaper and more desirable than subsidising new employers to take on workers in low-skilled, poorly-paid roles. It is for that reason that I have termed car manufacturing as a ""key industry"". Whilst I agree that private investment should be accepted from any source, no matter from America or abroad, I maintain that the profits should boost the American economy and the main operations be based in the US to benefit American workers. In conclusion, although bankruptcy need not be the end of the road for the ""Big 3"", thanks to the unique way America provides a parachute for failed corporations, it should be avoided at all costs. This is because the power is wrested away from the industry experts into the hands of administrators that know as much (or as little) about making cars as they do about selling insurance policies or growing GM crops. For the sake of the economy and American pride I urge the USFG to invest in one of the country's most important industrial assets and ask the voters to vote Con in support of this proposal. Thank you."	CON	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce
55	Scee72b1d-A4ba3f04a	0	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce

It harms the economies of developing world	Developing countries often face a problem when the local people simply cannot afford food (for example as a result of drought or floods destroying local crops) – thus giving them food for greatly reduced price helps a lot of people to survive at day to day basis. Even for farmers they are unlikely to grow the full range of crops so benefit from being able to obtain cheap foodstuffs. These countries can also if they wish control their import tariffs to ensure that the price of European food is comparable to local one – it is not that they are entirely helpless. The local producers have other benefits given by European Union – reduced taxation on exported agricultural products and development help – which help to compensate for these possible detrimental effects. Even without these programs, EU is still the biggest importer of foodstuff from the developing world by a big margin – therefore in balance the developing countries still receive more than lose by these seldom exports from EU.

To start off my opponent stated that there is ""no possible way that farming is producing any harmul gasses"" ""Livestock animals naturally produce methane as part of their digestive process, belching it while chewing cud and excreting it in their waste. According to the Worldwatch Institute, about 15 to 20 percent of global methane emissions come from livestock."" SOURCE: http://www.foodreference.com... He then proceeded to question the USDA by saying ""There is no soution that my opponent has given the meat industry produces 61millionstons of waste each year"" The USDA is a valid source, my opponent has presented us with no reason why there credibility should be in question. My opponent then made a conjecture with no factual backing that the government illegally steals tax money for their own benefit when he stated ""but by taxing the gov. is making money fo themselves and therfore they are taking advantage of us."" He has provided no sources at all to back up his claims that the government steals tax money instead of using it on the citizens. Thus I will dismiss his claim as being hearsay. Finally my opponent made four points which I will address separately 1. My opponent stated: ""Plants have a proccess of photosynthesis in which the plant uses carbon dioxide as a reactent,also providing a product of oxygen."" Perhaps my opponent missed this part of my first argument: ""By taxing agriculture in the form of x amount of cents per %/pound of pollution produced the tax will be passed onto the consumer"" It is in this statement that I denote that my resolution only is for taxing per pound of pollution. Thus if a farmers net pollution being produced is X pounds then he should be taxed x amount of cents per pound. Therefore if any of the farmers crops are minimizing pollution then it would in turn lessen his net amount of pollution which would be factored into the taxation. In lamens terms, my resolution does not advocate taxing forms of agriculture that do not produce pollution and such forms of agriculture would only benefit the farmer by lowering his net amount of pollution 2. ""By taxing agricultural farming we are putting farmers at risk of going broke which will stop agricultural farming from helping us supply the food we need to survive."" Anyone who is aware of basic economics knows supply and demand. In a free market if there is a demand for goods they will be supplied. Albeit some consumers will change their habits to buy forms of meat and vegetables that produce the least amount of pollution (due to lower cost) and overall food prices will increase. However this will not stop people from buying food, nor farmers from selling it. 3. ""By taxing agricultural farming,we are forcing people to pay money to help prevent global warming."" Yes and as higher levels of greenhouse gases are given to be harmful in this argument, that is a good thing. 4. ""not only helps us with the issue of world hunger"" No they have nothing to do with world hunger. The cause of world hunger is poor leaders, disease, unproductive citizens, and corrupt, tyrannical governments. But that argument is neither here nor there. Since my opponent has failed to refute my resolution, I will await his further arguments and responses in Round 2. Thank you for the debate, and good luck in round 2."

My opponent began by stating ""Making this a natural occurnce that we can not control but, then would hv(have I'm assuing) to do something about the animals not the whole idea."" I'm afraid I don't understand your point? My plan only taxes pollution. The tax would tax the pounds of pollution. It does not matter is the process is natural. Human waste is natural, but that does not mean that everyone forgoes to pay a sewage bill. ""If 61million tons of waste each year then where did it all go"" -Roughly half of the pollution in the Bay comes from agriculture, and half of that comes from animal agriculture, Fox said. Environmental groups have singled out commercial animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, in Lancaster County, Pa., as a major source of Bay pollution. Fox, in a telephone press conference to discuss EPA's plans to restore the Chesapeake, also said the federal government could expand the areas that need permits for development under the Clean Water Act. The areas would be high-growth sections within the Chesapeake watershed, he said. The EPA's plans follow a May 12 executive order from President Barack Obama calling for more federal involvement in the Chesapeake restoration effort. SOURCE: http://www.gazette.net... Animal waste is widely unregulated and it contaminates many water supplies. My opponent then went on again to question the USDA, which is valid source when he stated ""since neither me nor you see it around your area's, there (agian) is no proof that 61million tons of waste is being produced each year."" My opponent as presented us with no reason why there credibility should be in question. ""I'm sorry for that argument i made a mistake, this is my first debate."" I appreciate your apology, however in a debate, you would be best advised to never point out that you make an error in your reasoning. Instead, drop the argument and make new arguments. Emphasize your stronger arguments. ""Then if the food prices do go up because you are taxing agricultural farming, your idea is not just for the people for one. In these hard times where the economy is failing the Gov. should be helping the people with there demand's, not making it harder for them to live a full quality of life."" I agree completely. Everyone demands drinkable water and drinkable air. Currently the people are paying for that privilege through their taxes. However since the taxes are general and not tied to agricultural products that produce the most pollution, there is no financial incentive to buy goods that produce the least amount of pollution. By tying tax to the goods that produce the most pollution you give farmers a financial incentive to utilize technologies and use methods that produce the least amount of pollution. Also goods that produce the most amount of pollution will be bought the least by consumers. ""You see but this is not fair for the people if you are to just let agricultural farming go untaxed, then it will be better for the people and will help prevent global warming at the same time. And these are the reasons why we should just let agricultural farming go untaxed an left alone."" You provide no reasons how it isn't fair? It is in fact much fairer. By not taxing agriculture for the global warming it creates you will be increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (farmers will have no incentive to produce the least amount of pollution and consumers will have no incentive to purchase goods that produce the least amount of pollution) and thus be produce more global warming. You provide absolutely no logical reason nor evidence how global warming could possibly be lessened by leaving agricultural pollution untaxed. My opponent has provided no evidence nor any logical reasons that refute the resolution. Thus I extend my arguments and urge the voters of this debate to vote for me.

Subsidy reform of the type proposed will undermine agricultural businesses in the developing world	Reform will never effectively turn the tables in subsidy distribution. Large-scale agribusinesses have the power to manipulate policy through lobbying and directed campaign contributions in order to ensure they can maintain their comfortable government issued subsidies. Small family farms cannot compete with rich agro-corporations, who can spend millions of dollars lobbying to stop legislation that would reform current problematic subsidy expenditures. This is exactly why the implementation of bills similar to the 2002 Farm Bill (alongside others supported by subsidy reform activists such as Senators Chuck Grassley and Byron Dorgan) has been slow and piecemeal. As any system aimed at channelling federal money to agriculture will be open to abuses by individuals or organisations with sufficient resources to identify the lacunae in subsidy systems, it would be far better to end subsidies completely, supporting poorer farming families instead through welfare benefits and tax credits. Further, although the EU has made headway in reforming its approach to farm subsidies, it has done nothing to address other forms of subsidy. Payments made to cotton producers within the EU have survived reform programmes initiated in 1999, 2003 and 2007 more or less intact.[i] Moreover, the EU cotton subsidy is one of a small number of EU agricultural payments that remains linked to production – raising the same issues relating to over-production and export market distortion discussed above.

Subsidies create a sense of social equality	This kind of idealism and desire to make the world an equal place has already gotten us into quite a bit of trouble, ruining a large part of the world under the rule of communism. The idea that we could solve all the world’s problems through redistribution of wealth through government subsidies is not only naïve but also dangerous. Being committed to new human rights and wanting to offer help to the poor is not the same thing as imposing subsidies. Indeed, in many countries subsidies for particular activities end up favouring well-off landowners and the urban middle classes. Examples include agricultural subsidies in the EU (Financial Programming and Budget, 2011) and the USA, subsidies for power and water in rural India (Press Trust of India, ‘World Bank asks India to cut ‘unproductive’ farm subsidy’, 2007), and subsidies for water or Higher Education in much of Latin America. In each case the well-off benefit disproportionately, while the poor end up paying via the tax system and through reduced economic growth (Farmgate: the developmental impact of agricultural subsidies, ukfg.org.uk). It would be much better to price these activities at commercial levels and to develop economic policies aimed at growth and job creation.

Food is a unique good in the sense that it is essential to sustain life. The government should not gamble on this important industry surviving such elements as a fluctuating market-place and environmental change without federal support. Federal agricultural programmes are necessary to promote American self-sufficiency in food stuffs - vital for national security and the well-being of a country’s citizens. During a time when the US is involved in a massive ongoing war against terror, this food security is imperative. Subsidies are also helping us to make progress towards another form of self-sufficiency, as federal support for ethanol production (largely derived from maize grown in the US cornbelt) is contributing to reduced dependence upon imported oil.

55	Sd4c30caf-A46fb652f	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	On balance, corn subsidies in the U.S. are bad	"I thank my opponent for accepting the debate and give him props for his confidence. I begin with some definitions: ==DEFINITIONS== Corn: a type of crop with yellow ""ears""; technically a grain, not a vegetable [1] Subsidy, from Princeton's Wordnet, is ""financial support from public funds."" [2] Bad, from Princeton's Wordnet, is having negative consequences. [3] On balance: weighing all the good consequences against all the bad consequences ==MY CASE== 1. All subsidies are bad Subsidies merely create market distortions and impede the proper functioning of the free market, which is much better at allocating resources than the government is (see state planning and overproduction in the Soviet economy). 2. Provision of subsidies creates inequality In the U.S. Corn subsidies in the U.S. disproportionately go to the richest farmers. Common Dreams writes: ""Although the program began as a way to aid poor family farmers in the 1930s, by last year nearly three-quarters of the money went to the richest 10 percent of American farmers."" [4] According to the World Bank, the U.S. government sends 31 farm subsidy checks to addresses in Beverly Hills. Subsidies make it harder for smaller farms to compete. In the world In developing countries, many people depend on primary commodities (such as food crops) to make a living. However, U.S. subsidies force U.S. farmers to overproduce crops like corn and then sell the surplus on the world market. Small-time poor farmers cannot hope to compete with large, subsidized U.S. agro-business. According to Common Dreams, ""By guaranteeing U.S. farmers a minimum payment for commodities such as corn . . . the government encourages overproduction . . . Those subsidies make it possible to export millions of tons of food so cheaply that native farmers in places such as Jamaica can't possibly compete."" [5] 3. Obesity Corn is so heavily subsidized that it can be bought at prices ""below cost"" (i.e. costs less to buy corn than to produce it). For this reason, the food industry tries to use corn in everything; it is used to replace sugar (corn syrup), to feed pigs, cattle, and even salmon, and in vegetable oil (to make fried foods). Notice that the types of foods produced with ultra-cheap corn are generally unhealthy – sugary, fatty, and deep-fried foods. In contrast, healthy foods receive almost no subsidies. According to Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, ""We put maybe one-tenth of one percent of our dollar that we put into subsidizing and promoting foods through the Department of Agriculture into fruits and vegetables . . . As a result, the price gap between high-sugar, high-fat foods and more nutritionally valuable fruits and vegetables is artificially large."" [6] This is perfectly exhibited in the documentary Food Inc. when a poor family is asked to try to purchase the ingredients for a salad for the same price as a meal at McDonald's and is unable to do so. A $1 burger is heavily subsidized (cheap corn feed for the cattle), whereas a $3 head of lettuce is not. The relative cheapness of unhealthy foods is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemics sweeping the nation. Darius Lakdawalla, an obesity researcher at the National Bureau of Economic Research, conducted a study, which found that these cheap food prices ""account for as much as half of the increase in obesity that we've seen."" [7] Obesity causes a series of health problems, which contribute to the dramatically rising health care costs in the Untied States. For this reason, Dr. Barry Sears concludes: ""It would be less costly to simply eliminate the $20 billion in annual government support for corn and soybean production than to fix the health problems they cause."" [8] 4. E Coli Corn – because it is artificially cheap - is often fed to many animals whose bodies cannot naturally digest it. One major byproduct of corn digestion in these animals, particularly cattle, is E. coli bacteria. The E. coli end up in the animal's feces, which is dumped somewhere near the farm and spreads to nearby vegetable crops during the rainy season. This is why E. coli outbreaks have been happening with increasing frequency recently, not just in the beef industry, but in the spinach, tomato, and lettuce industry as well. The E. coli strains are often resistant to antibiotics because feed animals are packed in such tight quarters that they must be pumped full of antibiotics to prevent the rapid spread of infections. Creating massive amounts of antibiotic resistant deadly bacteria and allowing its runoff to enter our food crops seems like a bad idea. Tens of thousands of Americans are hospitalized each year with serious illnesses (kidney failure, seizures, paralysis) caused by E. coli, usually from meat. [9] The documentary Food Inc. explains that switching a cow from a corn diet to a grass diet will eliminate most of the E. coli in its gut within 36 hours. Eliminating corn subsidies would induce farmers to switch cattle to a grass diet, virtually eliminating the E. coli problem in the U.S. overnight. 5. Ethanol In a misguided effort to move towards alternative energy, the U.S. has increased corn subsidies by subsidizing the production of corn ethanol to the tune of 45 cents per gallon. [10] Subsidized ethanol producers are willing to pay more for the corn than consumers; this drives up the prices worldwide. From 2005 to 2008, the price of corn in the world doubled. [11] These rising food prices will cause many people in the world to starve. Environmental News Service reports, ""The United States, in a misguided effort to reduce its oil insecurity by converting grain into fuel for cars, is generating global food insecurity on a scale never seen before . . . The World Bank reports that for each 1 percent rise in food prices, caloric intake among the poor drops 0.5 percent. Millions of those living on the lower rungs of the global economic ladder, people who are barely hanging on, will lose their grip and begin to fall off."" [12] According to projections done by two professors at the University of Minnesota, without ethanol subsidies, the number of hungry and malnourished in the world would have declined by 175 million people by 2025. With ethanol subsidies, the number of hungry and malnourished is expected to grow by 400 million people by 2025. [13] This effort is further misguided because according to UC Berkeley geo-engineering professor Ted Patzek, it takes approximately 6 gallons of gasoline to produce one gallon of ethanol. [14] 6. Gas prices Because of subsidies, corn is over-produced in the U.S. This is problematic because corn takes an enormous amount of fossil fuels to produce, particularly because it takes a great deal of oil to create fertilizer. Agriculture accounts for 20% of U.S. fossil fuel consumption. [15] According to UC Berkeley News, ""the American corn diet is really an oil diet. Corn . . . is the SUV of plants. Growing it the way we do requires it to guzzle fuel in the form of fertilizer, about a quarter to a third of a gallon of petroleum for each bushel."" [16] Corn overproduction thus drives up the cost of gasoline in this country since corn production requires so much oil. [1] http://www.buzzle.com... [2] http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu...

55	Sb6697876-A766b9da2	0	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	It would be mutually beneficial for farmers in the West to recruit agricultural interns from Africa	"I would like to thank Canadian-in-Florida for accepting this debate and for posting such eloquent rebuttals, to which I duly respond as follows: 1. While it is true that Africa faces some serious problems beyond lack of technical know-how, it is nevertheless very important that the efforts existing NGO's are making to help develop agriculture in the region are enhanced by not only a trained workforce, which can be built up locally, but also an experienced workforce of former agricultural interns returning from their work placements in the West. 2. My opponent, quite rightly, compared agricultural internships with the most widely used method of enslaving people today: bonded labour. According to Anti-Slavery International ""bonded labour, or debt bondage, has existed for hundreds of years. In South Asia it is rooted in the caste system and flourishes in agriculture, in cottage industries, and in factories. Debt bondage was also used as a means of trapping indentured labourers into working on plantations in Africa, the Caribbean and South-East Asia, following the abolition of the slave trade."" Bonded labour has fallen out of favour in the West over recent times but the International Labour Organisation estimates ""a minimum 11.7 million are in forced labour in the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of whom are in debt bondage."" Bonded labour is illegal in most developing countries, but the practice remains widespread because the law is rarely enforced. Similarly, the unpaid graduate internships that are commonplace in the West, especially within large companies and investment banks, are technically illegal because the interns are unpaid and, therefore, do not receive the statutory minimum wage. Notwithstanding, the law is not generally enforced, indeed, the British Government even has an online portal which puts candidates in touch with 'employers' offering unpaid internships, where the worker (or more usually his or her parents) pays his or her own travel and living expenses but receives no income. So what's the difference between an unpaid agricultural intern and a bonded labourer? If a bonded labourer is a ""slave"" then so is an ""intern"", wether it be a graduate or an agricultural intern. Regarding the issue of debt, whereas a graduate intern would normally borrow money from the Bank of Mum and Dad to pay living expenses, an agricultural intern borrows the money from the farmer - unless he is a particularly fortunate young African who has parents rich enough to pay for his trip overseas to study Western agriculture. 3. Think of it this way, lots of people voluntarily obtain tattoos that identify them: most notably members of criminal gangs; but others proudly display tattoos of their favourite sporting teams, car or bike manufacturer or other popular affiliations - and for the agricultural their tattoo will represent a permanent souvenir of their trip to the West and best of all it's for free! 4. The reduction in the cost of Western crops would not necessarily lead to the African market being flooded with cheap food, but even if did this might be a good thing for the many people living on that continent that are malnourished. More likely, the reduction in the cost of food production in the West would have one or more of the following affects: a) The resulting increase in Western farmers' profit margins would reduce the need for state-funded agricultural subsidies, and these savings could be diverted to state aid for Africa which could be used to buy agricultural machinery. b) Lower food production costs in the West would mean that Western wholesalers would no longer import food from Asia where bonded labour is used to produce cheap crops. This would mean, for example, that rice produced in America would be as cheap as rice produced in India and American farmers could compete on a level playing field (or paddy field as the case may be). Again, this would lower prices, increase profits and reduce the need for state subsidies, thus allowing funds to be diverted to Africa. Of course, if some farmers were unscrupulous enough to exploit their interns by imposing unreasonable financial burdens on them, then charities could step in to pay off their debts: this would be a much more efficient way of helping Africa than channelling donations through corrupt regimes that skim money off to fund the lavish lifestyles of ruthless tyrants and their cronies. So, in conclusion, my agricultural internships would be good news for Western farmers, consumers and taxpayers plus Africans in general - in fact the only losers would be corrupt African dictators.

55	S37e9fe07-Aa8e11a88	0	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce
55	S2c813efa-A97c94a4	0	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	The user known as Danielle used dishonest tactics in her same-sex parenting debate.	"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce
55	S8c55999b-Ab37ac03d	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Agricultural Subsidies are a waste	"""it is also true that subsidies are given to farmers as a cushion for when they had a bad year or when their are disasters like floods, hurricanes, or a freeze that kills the crops. The subsidies are used to control the market if their is a surplus then the farmers don't need to plant. When their are shortages then subsidies are still given to farmers so that they can plant even more.""----------------------------------------------------So my opponent concurs that taxpayer money is given to citizens who do nothing. He states when ""their is a surplus then farmers don't need to plant"". He is supposing that crops are currently being produced to point where they are worthless if sold. This is completely incorrect. Currently if there was a ""surplus"" and farmers decided to produce to their maximum, the price of the goods would simply fall. Not to zero. It's self evident. People are starving in other countries. A higher supply of crops would merely mean more consumption at a lower price. it's a simple shifting of the supply curve to the right.Furthermore, let's suppose that by some divine miracle, the US was producing so many crops that the price of crops was nearly at zero. Instead of paying the farmers TO DO NOTHING, we should be paying them nothing, allowing them to find new jobs that provide utility to the economy that would be profitable.What we are doing is essentially using taxpayer dollars for someone to dig a hole and then fill it. Someone sitting on their butt and doing nothing provides absolutely no utility to the populace as a whole.Not only is the US government paying for absolutely nothing, but even if they were producing crops, it is still a waste of taxpayer dollars, because the crops produce no extra utility outside of their business transaction. Farmers are already compensated for their services through the payment of the customer. If this is not profitable then workers should find a new industry that is profitable to work in.-------------------------------------------------------------""I assume the word farming refers to crops my opponent equivocates crops to producing methane however as he pointed out that methane emission comes from livestock.""""Agricultural"" or ""farming"" are a general terms used to refer to things that are produced on a farm. Agricultural subsidies also go to purely dairy farms as well as farms that produce purely crops. $295 Million dollars are appropriated toward diary farms in the US. These farms produce the methane gas and water pollution that was mentioned in the opening round, thus they are relevant in the statement that agriculture can be a negative externality.In addition it is not only livestock that produce pollution.According to 1998 EPA data, agricultural pollution is the leading cause of water quality impairment in lakes, streams and rivers. Agricultural pollution is the fifth leading cause of water quality impairment in estuaries.(Source: U.S. EPA brochure - PDF)Nutrients from fertilizers and manure travel from Midwest farm states down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, causing a massive ""dead zone"" on the Louisiana coast. The nutrients, including nitrogen and phosporous, trigger a process whereby excess algael growth and decomposition reduces oxygen levels in the water, killing fish, shrimp, crabs and other sea life in an area nearly 8,000 square miles in size. Farm fertilizers contribute 50 percent of this nutrient pollution. Livestock manure contributes another 15 percent and municiple and industrial sources account for 11 percent.(Source: American Rivers) ""I concede to this but I must point out that you are talking about industry (corporation) an entity almost completely free from gov't interference.""A corporation is not completely free from government interference (See: the FDA on literally every medication on the market produced by corporations)My opponent has this view that livestock are kept in farms and by decreasing the number of farmers livestock should decrease as well however that is false the number of livestock is not dependent on the number of farmers. Livestock are usually kept nearby factories unless he is talking about dairy farms; however I have dismissed this because my opponent has used the term ""livestock"" referring to domesticated animals like cows,pigs,horses,chickens, etc.I do not have that view, I don't know how you came to think that. By eliminating agricultural subsidies, the taxpayer will not have to pay for something that is not only not a positive externality (fireworks, public water fountains) but really is a negative externality (pollution).I negate that agricultural subsidies are a waste of taxpayer dollars they are in fact necessary making them the opposite of a waste. While my opponent can argue that they are a negative externality he must also ague that agricultural subsidies are in fact a waste.Paying for something that has no benefit and is actually harmful is a waste. They are not necessary for anything and my opponent has not given even the smallest amount of evidence that they are necessary for anything. If the use of land was left up to the ""free market"" there wouldn't be food or grain left to the community.I want to see a mathematical proof or logical reasoning how people would rather have a house than eat."

Such a deal cannot be achieved if the US administration “gives away the farm” by unilateral cuts in farm support - such a move would remove any leverage the USA has in the negotiations and would provide no incentive for our competitors to reduce their own subsidies and tariffs.

I'm saying that if the methane gasses are by there own digestive system, then this is a nartural cause that no matter what we cannot prevent.

I am saying that if 61million tons of waste is produced each year where could it possibly go?The waste would build up to extreme levles if this was true. Thank You for the advice But then going back to my previous argument where ""if animals are producing 61million tons of waste each year where is it all goin? Making on my point here that, there is no need to have taxes on somthing that is doing littl to no harm. I have no need to provide a source becasue it is well known that that much waste would build up to extreme lvls if it were true,making it impossible because there is no place that can hold that much waste. My opponent is providing he people a harder quality of life by putting more taxes on them. Please ask yourself that""Is this really fair to us and others out there?"" before u vote.

I'm sorry for that argument i made a mistake, this is my first debate. (In this part i am addresing point 2.)

In these hard times where the economy is failing the Gov. should be helping the people with there demand's, not making it harder for them to live a full quality of life. Addressing point 3. You see but this is not fair for the people if you are to just let agricultural farming go untaxed, then it will be better for the people and will help prevent global warming at the same time.

55	S24dca915-Abdbbd53c	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Resolved: That the U.S. Should end all agricultural subsidies.	"I'd like to start off by thanking whomever takes the time to read this for giving me some semblance of importance, the voters for voting, and whomever decides to argue in negation for offering the alternative perspective. I would also like to precede my arguments by offering a couple of definitions: ""agricultural: of, relating to, used in, or concerned with agriculture"" (Merriam-Webster Dictionary) ""subsidy: money that is paid usually by a government to keep the price of a product or service low or to help a business or organization to continue to function"" (Merriam-Webster Dictionary) I will argue in negation of this proposition on two main contentions - (1) subsidies stabilize the agricultural market and (2) agriculture accounts for a large portion of the U.S. economy. To begin, subsidized farming stabilizes the agricultural commodity markets overall. Granting agricultural workers these funds ensures that there will not be price spikes in general necessities (food, clothing, etc.) because the subsidies can compensate for poor yields for reasons including poor weather (an uncontrollable force). Not only that, but this money would also make for a predictable farming system. Farmers would have the ability to stay up-to-date with farming systems and equipment, and, consequently, increase productivity. What""s more, is that agriculture holds a large portion of the U.S. economy; therefore, ending these subsidies would only hinder the economy. Looking at the U.S., agriculture accounts for $789 billion of our GDP (but this isn't the entirety of agriculture's effect on the GDP because this number does not take relying industries - like forestry, fishing, food, apparel, leather, etc. - into account. Agriculture also accounts for 16.9 million jobs in the U.S. (9.2% of U.S. employment). This being said, removing the subsidies would deter and push workers away from the agriculture industry, increase the unemployment rate, and decrease the U.S. GDP. In conclusion, ending agricultural subsidies only hinders people overall. Maintaining them, on the other hand, has the potential to maintain a stable market for necessities for both the farmers and the consumers, and to maintain (or perhaps benefit) the nation's economy.

American food subsidies are actually good for the developing world. The kinds of food stuffs which are exported to the poorer countries are staples like wheat, maize, milk products and sugar. Our subsidies ensure that these basic foods are available more cheaply to consumers in poor countries than they would be otherwise, so their limited incomes can go further and they can eat better. Nor are these exports undermining local producers - often the produce we sell in the developing world grows better in the USA than it does in their local conditions. And in any case, the key to their development doesn’t lie in producing such capital-intensive commodity crops, but in exporting labor-intensive produce in which they have a comparative advantage, such as prepared vegetables, palm oil, cut flowers and cocoa.

Social change	The change from an agricultural or rural economy to an urban one does not preclude subsidies as  a way of lifting people out of poverty  it simply means that subsidies have to be more targeted. As most cities continue to grow and attract more and more people from rural areas, the state needs to find a way to address the problem of urban migration, which is closely linked to the formation of poor communities particularly around cities. Illegal immigration also contributes tremendously to this problem, particularly in areas such as the Mexico-California border. Targeted subsidies can slow the pace of migration, by giving those in the countryside and in poorer countries a better standard of living where they already live.

For the reasons given above, market prices for agricultural produce can vary greatly from year to year. Without government support to smooth out fluctuations, consumers would sometimes be faced with price spikes when harvests were poor (or because many farmers had been driven out of business, reducing supply). As family income is pretty fixed, price spikes for basic foods such as bread, breakfast cereal, meat, beans, dairy products and even beer could really affect the standard of living enjoyed by many Americans. Even if such high prices only occurred occasionally, their possibility would create general uncertainty about future levels of disposable income. This could be very damaging to consumer confidence, and so to the economy as a whole.	CON	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce
55	Scde43845-Aa01412a	1	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	The United States should have a general policy of free trade.	"Trade can be restricted by several means. Tariffs can be put on imports and exports in a direct violation of free trade. However, indirect methods can be used to upset free markets. Governments can provide research or production subsidies, and the government can require purchase of local products for government use. For example, Friedman [1. http://www.thomaslfriedman.com... ] documents the bad effect of agricultural subsidies in Europe and the United States have had on Third World economies by obviating the advantage that producers would otherwise have in certain crops.1. Free Trade Benefits Both Trading PartnersA producer of certain goods has an absolute advantage if he can produce those goods more cheaply than anyone else. almost always, a country has an absolute advantage in producing some goods. Free trade maximizes efficiency, and hence prosperity, by allowing countries to produce more of the goods they are best at, and less of the goods at which they are less efficient.An economy that has no absolute advantage will nonetheless have a comparative advantage [2. http://en.wikipedia.org...] in producing some goods over others. The theory of comparative advantage then shows that the country is better off producing more of what it is better at producing, and less of other things. The theory f comparative advantage says that both trading partners will still benefit from free trade, even one has no absolute advantage in anything.We might wonder how poor countries have an advantage in anything. Agricultural products depend upon growing conditions and labor costs. No matter how well capitalized, the US does not have an advantage in growing bananas or coffee. Poor countries have cheap labor and are likely to have an advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing. Poor countries often have unique attractions that make them competitive for tourism.In most economies the majority of goods and services are not subject to foreign competition. Restaurants and local shops, schools and government, roads and airports, houses and commercial buildings, as well as all the support services that go along with these things are not subject to foreign competition. Friedman [1] calculated that only 19% of the U.S, GDP is subject to potential foreign competition. ""For 2011, exports of $2,103.1 billion and imports of $2,661.1 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $558.0 billion ..."" [3. http://www.bea.gov... ] The Gross Domestic Product was $15,094.4 billion. [4. http://www.bea.gov... ] so 17.4% of GDP was spent on imports, but all but 3.6% of that was offset by exports. Does the theory of comparative advantage work in practice? ""Though it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among members of the economics profession in the U.S. is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society.[26] [27] In a 2006 survey of American economists (83 responders), ""87.5% agree that the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade"" and ""90.1% disagree with the suggestion that the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries.""[28] [5. http://en.wikipedia.org... ]2. Dislocations are acute, benefits are chronicIf there is nearly universal agreement among economists that free trade is beneficial, then why is it so often opposed? The reason is that the job losses are easy to identify while the job gains are spread over society. for example, the U.S. allows inexpensive manufactured goods to be imported. Jobs sewing underwear were consequently lost in North Carolina, and it's easy to point to those lost jobs. The gain is in the lowered price of underwear, a gain that benefits buyers of underwear. Money not spent on underwear is then available for other purposes. The money saved is available to purchase competitive goods.Wal-Mart calculated that the total saved from Wal-Mart pricing amounted to $2500 per family in 2006. [6. http://www.aef.com...] Wal-mart got into trouble by implying that the saving came solely from Wal-Mart, when it actually came from the general lowering of prices by Wal-marts competitors as well. The lower prices do not derive entirely from imports. Some of the savings come from the efficiency of the distribution system. The point is that the economy benefits by spending fewer resources on things that America is not competitive in producing, and greater resources on things in which it is competitive.Friedman's book [1] catalogs examples of high tariffs damaging economies around the world. South America, notably Brazil, ""protected"" local markets with high tariffs for decades, with resulting poverty. Removing tariffs were key to economic revival. In the early 50s, Hindustani Motors in India and Toyota in Japan were about equal-sized car manufacturers. Hindustani Motors was protected by high tariffs, while Toyota was subject to international competition. Predictably, competition yielded efficiency and growth. It's reasonable for government to assist in retraining and relocating workers for jobs in growth industries. It is unreasonable to suppose the country's future lies in keeping workers sewing underwear forever at the expense of consumers.Customers have a right to buy inexpensive productsGovernment does not have a right to force consumers to pay high prices to keep outdated industries alive. If consumers choose to buy more expensive products for whatever reasons, that the consumer's business. Government doesn't have the right to make the decision that a consumer will pay more for products A, B, and C because the government favors those industries. It is an unjustified intrusion upon the individual's right to make consumer choices. There is inherent corruption in government choosing which outdated industry is to receive the benefits of protection and by how much. Once a general promise of protection is made, then when an industry starts to fall behind foreign competition their remedy is seek protection from competition rather than reform and become more efficient. Government must decide how much above market price an inefficient producer will be paid. That determination is subject to political influence. Around 1990, the world price of sugar was four cents a pound. Price supports kept the domestic U.S. price at 22 cents. Now, price supports keep the domestic price at two or three times the world market price. Consumers end up paying the subsidy, but also production of candy is shifted out of the United States and the candy is imported instead of the sugar.

I would like to say that i am starting on my opponents case then i shall introduce my own. There could be no possible way that farming is producing any harmul gasses. My opponent states that, Farming is negativley externality becasue it is resonsible for producing methane. He only stated that somone said farming is producing methane but there is no possible way that farmin has anything to do with methane. Here he is stating that the (USDA) reports say that animals in the meat industry produce 61 millions tons of waste each year, but how does it produce waste? There is no solution that my opponent has given that meat industry produces 61millions tons of waste each year. We should not tax farming. So my opponent is saying we should be taxing agricultural with the cost of cleaning up the pollution of methance gasses and other forms of pullutants. He is stating that it's the Gov. responsibility to prevent the citizen from being takin advantage of,but by taxing the gov. is making money fo themselves and therfore they are taking advantage of us. I shall now introduce my own case First off i would like to state that Agricultural farming consiting of plants not only helps us with the issue of world hunger but also it helps us with global warming. Plants have a proccess of photosynthesis in which the plant uses carbon dioxide as a reactent,also providing a product of oxygen. Statement One: By taxing agricultural farming,we are forcing people to pay money to help prevent global warming. In wat way is it right to force people to pay money to provide a better world? By taxing agricultural farming we are putting farmers at risk of going broke which will stop agricultural farming from helping us supply the food we need to survive, but we are also potentially destroying another persons life which is not the American way.

Government intervention in the marketplace contradicts the values of free-trade advocated by the USA. Our complex series of agricultural subsidies, price supports, regulations and protective tariffs means that farming in the US functions as a command economy - in effect, we have a socialist agricultural system.

55	S5c61ba4c-A4f40c396	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Subsidies incentivise environmentally harmful farming practices	Subsidies can contribute significantly to longer term ecological and environmental damage. By rendering the export of food so profitable, subsidies increase the use of air freight and rapid road haulage, increasing the emissions cost of trading produce. Subsidies also cause the loss of land management and farming skills amongst the working population of developing states. As small farmers and more affluent land owners are priced out of domestic markets by imports from the developed world, they will increasingly turn to alternative methods of making money. Farming skills will not be passed on to other family members or to agricultural workers. Unemployed agricultural workers will be affected by deskilling. In addition, they may migrate away from their home states in search of jobs. Otherwise useful, fertile land may be left fallow, becoming damaged and eroded due to neglect. Subsidies encourage monoculture farming – the large scale production of specialised produce. Subsidies instituted by the US government that were intended to encourage the production of maize for use in biofuels led many farmers to give over excessive acreage to the crop. Monoculture crops can expose farmer to economic risks that subsidies cannot compensate for. If a particularly virulent strain of disease attacks a monoculture crop it is likely to spread quickly, assisted by the large, un-partitioned fields and storage areas that are characteristic of the practice. This, in turn, will lead to widespread crop failure, incurring significant losses for the farmers involved. Moreover, the need to protect large amounts of uniformly vulnerable biomass from pests and disease causes farmers to employ large quantities of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, all of which can damage soil quality, pollute water sources and harm local biodiversity.[i] Finally, subsidies also encourage intensive agricultural production in unsuitable or unstable areas. Examples of this practice include the cultivation of fruit and vegetable crops in naturally arid areas of south California. Successful cultivation of this produce has necessitated the construction of extensive and disruptive irrigation networks. The burden that irrigation has placed on the Sacramento-san Joaquin delta, west of San Francisco has become so great that the salinity of delta water is now slowly increasing, due to tidal intrusion of seawater. This change in the salt content of irrigation water threatens to pollute the same soil that the irrigation system feeds.[ii] [i] Price, Aaron E., ‘Corn Monoculture no friend of Biodiversity’, Ethanol: Salvation or Damnation?, University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Journalism and Mass Communications DEEP Report, 2008, http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/journalismstudent/16/ [ii] Ikehara, Marti E., and Ingebritsen, S.E., ‘Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta The sinking heart of the state’, U.S. Geological Survey, http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/circ1182/pdf/11Delta.pdf	PRO	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce
55	S8c55999b-A63df8372	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Agricultural Subsidies are a waste	A business would observe another business getting to know it's competition. they tend to avoid price competition, using non-price means to increase their market share. However the farm sector is different. they will not, as a rule, respond to falling prices by taking land out of production that is, working to raise prices by limiting supply. Just the opposite: confronted with falling prices, farmers will attempt to increase output in hopes of offsetting falling per-unit revenues by a higher total volume of unit sales. Failure to do so will put them out of business sooner rather than later.Since when do businesses avoid competition? This is completely innaccurate. The farming sector will respond to profit not prices. If it becomes unprofitable to be a farmer, then people will stop becoming farmers, sell their land, and retrain in a new industry. Increasing output produces more profit. So the general effect of removing agricultural subsidies will be lower prices for the consumer and a more efficient use of the farming land that is profitable. If demand for farming products is relatively inelastic to the price (which it is not) then farming will become unprofitable and we will have less farmers which will reduce the supply in the long term.My opponent is also completely ignoring goods which are elastic to price(ethanol, soda, ice cream, etc.)So the normal operation of the market which aggregates the decisions of many individuals is for lower prices to trigger higher output, leading to even lower prices.I don't seem to see a problem, more efficient farms and lower prices for the consumer.Ok so I concede that it is a negative externality how is it a waste though that's what this debate is about. Paying money for a negative externality is by definition a waste of taxpayer money. Another example would be like saying the government is using your tax money to produce more pollution with no other benefit. It would be a complete waste of your money, because the government could be using that same money to build public water fountains, maintain roads. Anything that benefits the taxpayer. The governement is spending taxpayer money to pollute the rivers, streams, kill fish, boost methane content in the air, etc. This is a waste of the taxpayer dime when it could be used to do something that actually benefits the taxpayer (positive externality) or just not used in the absence of a positive externality to subsidize (less to pay in taxes) and thus be used by the taxpayer for consumption which would provide greater utility than pollution.Do you not see that from a taxpayer perspective spending tax money on something that harms the general tax payer is a waste?I have shown that Agricultural subsidies are a negative externality. My opponent has conceded this point. Negative Externalities are waste by definition. Therefore Agricultural subsidies are a waste of taxpayer money.Taxes are used (or are meant to be used) to benefit the taxpayer. If they are harming the taxpayer or not benefiting the taxpayer, then they are being wasted.	PRO	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce

I hope and will pray that my opponent is safe… only too busy to post or comment. I do want to address a few more things that surround the PSAT concern stated by my opponent. I do feel very confidant my opponents Single Objection of PSAT being an unjust system and should be rejected as a system of justice... has been clearly refuted. Below are two concepts for my opponent to better understand PSAT and to come a better understanding of the different viewpoints for existence. A commenter has continued to discuss this at length and challenge the multiple viewpoints. He continues to cite my statements as propitiatory satisfaction and has lead my opponent to the same argument. I post further down an article by Dr. Ian Shaw a reformed theologian that asserts the same as I do. Propitiatory satisfaction is an interlocking element to PSAT. It is how Jesus fulfilled the penal substitution. My opponent did not in his first round or resolution make any statement that I needed to directly take the side of a single view of PSAT. I took the debate with an understanding there was no such restriction to a single denominational view or a single system of thought. Thus, to clarify a more full understanding, all denominations hold to a Penal understanding of the Cross of Christ. CONCEPT 1> To start with the Catholics (Next the Arminianists): Reparation (Penal Substitution) theology is quite prevalent but there are many Catholics who argue against any Penal aspects. That does not say, ""there is NO Catholic PSAT"", only that there is debate in the Catholic Church and differing views are held. (Same concept of the followers of Mary and those who appose the worship of Mary.) http://www.newadvent.org... ""Although God might have condoned men's offences gratuitously if He had chosen to do so, yet in His Providence He did not do this; He judged it better to demand satisfaction for the injuries which man had done Him. It is better for man's education that wrong doing on his part should entail the necessity of making satisfaction. This satisfaction was made adequately to God by the Sufferings, Passion, and Death of Jesus Christ, made Man for us."" Here is an example of this in Catholic Practice http://www.rosary-center.org... The First Sorrowful Mystery THE AGONY IN THE GARDEN 1.Jesus comes with his disciples to Gethsemani: ""Stay here, while I go yonder and pray."" 2.Entering the garden with Peter, James, and John, Jesus prays, ""My soul is sorrowful unto death."" 3.Jesus sees the sins of all mankind, whose guilt He has taken upon Himself. 4.He sees the wrath of the Father which His sufferings must appease. 5.So great is his anguish that His sweat becomes as drops of blood falling to the ground. 6.An angel appears to Him from heaven to strengthen Him. 7.""Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet, not My will but Yours be done."" 8.Finding the disciples asleep: ""Could you not watch one hour with me?"" 9.Jesus is betrayed by Judas, cruelly bound and led away. 10.Father, by the merits of the agony of Jesus in the Garden, have mercy on us and on the whole world. Catholics do hold to a PSAT view but it is very different than a Reformed's version. Jesus is the propitiatory satisfier of God's Penal demand for reparations. Sound incredibly... dead on... familiar? ****** CONCEPT 2> The Arminian/Wesleyan/Protestant Anglican also hold to the PSAT but it differs from both the Catholic and the Reformed.(each of these three slashes do have subtle differences but I will lump them together due to much of their similarities www.e-n.org.uk/p-3348-'Justice-divine-is-satisfied'.htm This link will need to be pasted to view. Here is an article excerpt from Dr. Ian J. Shaw a REFORMED Historian Lecturing at International Christian College in Glasgow. This reformed theologian recognizes that my arguments with the commentator are valid. Propitiatory satisfaction is the resolution to the Penal substitution of Jesus to satisfy the justice of God. Dr Ian clearly states that there is no conflict between Propitiatory satisfaction and Penal substitution that even that Arminianists (such as myself) hold to both and teach both. Propitiatory satisfaction is indeed the fulfillment of the event of Penal substitution of Jesus Christ for us. This is the view held by most in the Arminian camp today. Conclusion >> 1)The rosary and the Catholic reparation theology 2)The reformed Dr. Ian clearly teaching that Propitiatory satisfaction is NOT in opposition to Penal Substitution but can go hand in hand. 3) The reformed J.I. Packer's lecture in 1973 on the differing views of PSAT 3)My own teachings and understandings of each denominations belief systems regarding Penal Substitution These three show that my opponents Statements that I am arguing for Propitiatory satisfaction is clearly wrong. I am stating that Propitiatory satisfaction refutes his objections to Penal Substitution. Propitiatory satisfaction is NOT an opposing belief system but goes hand in hand and is a necessary next step to clearly understanding PSAT. This shows that my opponents initial objection to God being unjust under a Penal substitution system is profoundly inaccurate. Hopefully these layouts resolve some of the issues and complexities my opponent and the commentator tried to bring up."	PRO	agricultural subsidies reduced	agricultural subsidy reduce

55	S24dca915-A734de25a	2	2	Should agricultural subsidies be reduced?	Resolved: That the U.S. Should end all agricultural subsidies.	"Cool debate, thanks for posting. IMO, should be under economics, but it's definitely politics too.I'll go over my affirmation of the resolution with contentions and some warranting, and then I'll rebut my opponent's arguments.1. Pareto EfficiencyWhen designing public policy, a public economist attempts to achieve a world in which no one person may be made better off without making another worse off. Subsidies create deadweight loss, or a reduction in overall welfare as a result of a shift from equilibrium. The welfare gained through giving money to agricultural companies is overwhelmed by the welfare lost by taxation. A subsidy is inherently less efficient than the free market, and unless con can show a compelling enough interest to overcome this, we ought recommend that a policymaker oppose the subsidies. (would cite source, but it's basic econ 101, simple search of ""subsidies"" & ""deadweight loss"" works). Getting rid of subsidies would place the market in its natural equilibrium and relieve a burden which is currently levied upon the taxpayers.2. PolitickingWhenever subsidies are granted, avenues through which lobbyists are able to influence the particular form of the subsidies are inevitable. This leads to both allocation of subsidies in an inefficient manner as well as conferring of benefits upon larger companies as a result of greater lobbying power. When larger companies, such as Monsanto, gain more market power through selective subsidy allocation, competition decreases and the consumer suffers. Here's a link that talks about both the lobbying presence surrounding agricultural subsidies:http://investigatemidwest.org... Here's one about the allocation of subsidies (they primarily go to a few big companies) http://farm.ewg.org...Not only does this damage competition and efficiency, but it also leads to environmental impacts. Intuitively, we can see that subsidies lead to increased production of goods, beyond equilibrium levels. However, while there are no positive externalities associated with agricultural production (all benefits are realized by either the producer or the consumer), there are negative externalities in the form of high levels of pollution. Subsidizing an industry with a large negative externality is simply bad economics. Such a subsidy pushes us far from private optimum, but even farther from social optimum.Furthermore, the disproportionate meting of subsidies to larger corporations results in even greater levels of environmental degradation. These companies with access to more funding and resources are more likely to use things such as pesticides (damaging local ecosystems), overuse resources such as water, deplete resources in the soil, and emit pollutants at higher levels, as these companies will tend to operate at a more industrial, mechanized level. Here's a report from the NCPA about the harms associated with these subsidies:http://www.ncpa.org...3. International harmsSubsidies override principles of comparative advantage. Countries without large taxbases cannot compete, and thus we inefficiently drive those with a comparative advantage out of the market. Poorer countries become poorer and less stable, and this threatens US interests abroad and domestically. Subsidies lead to overproduction and dumping in countries like Mexico, killing their industries and leading to issues such as mass migrant worker movements and increased rates of crime. REBUTTALS (quickly)1. A subsidy cannot help a low crop yield become larger. With or without subsidies, poor yields cause companies to fail to meet current goals, set with subsidies in mind. A simple alternative to equitably/efficiently solve this is insurance, not subsidies. 2nd one is simple. Yes, subsidies are big. The benefits conferred upon Americans aren't as big, however, as the tax dollars necessary to fund them. The opportunity cost of this money is ignored in con's analysis."

"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"

73	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind.

Endangerd animals usually can't be rehabilitated into the wild if they've been kept in zoos, it is too much of a drastic change, they'll starve.

Aesthetics	The problem with this argument is that it prioritizes the enjoyment of some individuals over others with no real justification. The grey wolf, for example, went extinct in the Yellowstone region in the first place because humans considered it a pest and a threat to livestock and so hunted it to extinction. Clearly these people didn't enjoy the 'diversity' the grey wolf provided. We don't usually give something the force of law regarding animals just because some people enjoy it. For example, the UK has now banned fox hunting even though a great many people found it to be a source of pleasure and recreation.[1] If everyone desired the protection of all endangered species, there would be no need for this law, but the fact that a law is needed to restrain human action shows that not everyone 'enjoys' this biodiversity in the same way.

Endangered Species are protected more than Humans (A Debate about Abortion)	"Again, I was hoping that in R2 you would make your argument clearer but clearly you did not forsee the problems addressing with abortion. If abortion was such an easy topic then society wouldn't have this problem to begin with. Basically if you are for abortion than you don't believe every human is equal...it is unfair that a baby must be killed. To start off, you used ""then"" wrong. It is not ""than"" but ""then."" In no way have you proven to me why a fetus (at any stage) is considered a human. From this statement alone, you are suggesting that it is wrong for me to kill mold, because they are composed of cells too. Additionally, if I was working with cells for research, it would be wrong for me to dispose of yeast cells because they are considered human. So if your argument was valid then I would agree, human life is not equal. I find my life as a person with mental capacity to be of higher value than an insect or an epithelial cell, whose only function in life is to sit there in media. But of course, what I'm doing is wrong. When it comes down, I should give the same respect to myself as I would to others, especially to that epithelial cell that is just sitting in my petri dish. Endangered species is not irrelevant because it is the topic to this debate! What we are talking about here is the society. The general people in America have put more money into killing babies than helping them, and they have put more money into protecting endangered species than into protecting babies. Let me ask you: which is more important, endangered animals who don't do anything important to help us, or humans? If you said animals DO help us and, besides, humans are over-populating, that would be equal to saying that not every human is special, am I not correct? Seems to me that you are getting confused between animal rights and abortion. I'm pretty sure these are separate topics. Philosophically though, you can address both issues with certain moral reasoning, but the argument you make does not hold any weight. Moreover, in R1, the first sentence you state that it was an abortion issue? So how is being an endangered species an abortion issue? Are you suggesting that animals have the same rights as humans? If so, I will refute that argument with social contract theory (I'm not gonna digress.)Your rhetoric is useless so I will fire back with another useless question, which do you like more, a lamp or a lamp post?I cannot fathom at what goes on in your head as you wrote your rebuttal. Please explain to me how animals helpping us and human overpopulation equals not every human is equal in terms of rights? In my opinion, abortion is permissible up to the third trimester of pregnancy. After this stage, it is believed that the fetus will have some normal brain and heart function. Before the 3rd trimester, you have a ball of cells. It literally cannot do anything but be a ball of cells. While I do agree with you that those cells are considered living, but the problem is that they have no reasoning, they cannot feel pain, they cannot be independent, their only function is to be a ball...of cells. Nothing else. Anwyays like I said earlier if you don't define your arguments clearly then it's a big waste of time. As you can see, I was right because we did not debate about anything. It really was me asking you to clarify your arguments and showing you why your reasoning was flawed."	CON	endangered species protected	endangered species protect

73	Sc7da56de-Aed20c842	2	2	Should endangered species be protected?	We should be trying to prevent species from becoming extinct.	"Ok, then allow me to convince you of what you say you already know, which is that we should strive to protect all species from extinction. You argue: ""'The 'balance' of nature is a myth, everything changes, natural selection is inevitable. We can try to save species, but in the end they will either adapt to our actions and/or perish more slowly, making the philosophy behind our trying to save them the way they are seem kind of silly.'"" If you mean that using the balance of nature as an argument to why we should preserve species then you are absolutely right, this will not be my argument at all. ""1. Saving the endangered species is inevitable, because they are part of the natural evolutionary process."" Not what I was about to claim either. Here is what I would argue for this cause: Basically our notion of morality is the exact opposite of the natural process, since the whole idea behind the natural process is to kill off the weak to allow the strong to survive. Since, in society, most of us feel a need to protect the weaker and less fortunate amongst our kind, it would be inconsistent if we hadn't done so for animals as well, that would also make us, therefor, less moral. Another important aspect of preserving endangered species is the importance they bare or may bare on scientific research, many times this research leads to the benefit of the well being of humans. Take, for example, the scrub mint. It has been found that the scrub mint contains an antifungal agent and a natural insecticide (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p. 418). Also, the deterioration of the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon ""alerted people to the potential health hazards associated with the widespread spraying of DDT and other persistent pesticides"" (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p. 418). This serves as an example of how certain fish can serve as identifiers of environmental health and protect human life as well as other species. Finally, an example of species providing for scientific discoveries is the instance of the Pacific yew which ""became the source of taxol, one of the most potent anticancer compounds ever discovered"" (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p. 418-419). Endangered species could prove useful to human development, maintenance of biodiversity and preservation of ecosystems. ""2. Trying to save the endangered species is costly and spend taxpayers' money that could be better used on health care and social services."" This is a false dilemma. Either we save endangered species or we invest in social services. Why not say either we invest in our health services or we invest in our military ? Moreover protecting endangered species is practically a profitable business. Take for example the protection of rhinos. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The private sector has been key to helping this work. see: He's black, and he's back!

"My argument:There are several dozen animals on the endangered species list, some of which include the Chinese Giant Salamander, the kakapo, the saiga, the goliath frog, the malaysian tapir, the catarina pupfish, and several other animals you probably never heard of. http://en.wikipedia.org...There are a ton of animals on the endangered species list that youve never heard of, because the Endangered Species Act is hipster like that, and everyone knows that Hipsters are f*cking annoying. To the main point.... Who is the government to decide which species people care about? Whats next, Congress will decide which video games people like or which singers are important? When the Endangered species act was signed in 1973, Nixon and all of Congress made the mistake in thinking that people cared about ALL endangered animals. Nixon though wasnt exactly the best judge of what people would or wouldnt care about (Watergate, Vietnam, Hippies), and weve had to suffer from him being disconnected from the public ever since. I know its shocking to think there was once a time when Republican politicians were disconnected from reality, but that was the case back in the 1970's.So why should only cool animals be protected under the endangered species act? Because your money shouldnt be spent to protect animals you didnt know existed, and the only animals that people know exist that are on the endangered list are animals that people think are cool. Why spend money on things people dont care about when we already dont spend money on things people DO care about? That just doesnt make sense!

However they are only protected because if the species goes extinct, it may have negative affects on people. If you kill an endangered species, you are not charged with murder, you have to pay a fine and do some jail time. Next most of your argument revolves around the concept: They are alive, therefore it is wrong to kill them. This argument ignores the fact many living things including bacteria, fungi, and plants are living, however are not considered valuable at all. It is not considered wrong to take antibiotics or set up a few rat traps. Now why should it be considered wrong to abort a fetus that doesn't even have brain functions on par with a rat's. That ehealthforum source you cited only proves one thing, that the fetus is a living, which I have shown means nothing, considering our treatment of other living organisms. The last argument you bring up is the idea that it will become conscious at some point in time. For this it is important to remember that we treat things how they are, not based on what they will become. A presidential candidate is not the president until they are elected and a criminal is only a criminal until they are convicted. It is also important to remember that the potential for a baby exists the second a boy and girl enter the same room, yet they are not arrested for not having the sex which could conceive a baby. The potential may be there, but that is all it is, potential, and in no way trumps the bodily rights of a person.	PRO	endangered species protected	endangered species protect

Zoos will keep them cramped in a tiny space which is not what they need to get better. Animals should not be forced to repopulate which is what happens when they are in a zoo. All the public wants is to see a new baby animal so the animals are forced to mate so that the public can get what they want as well as the zoo. They will in turn make more money off the people who come to see the new baby animal.	CON	endangered species protected	endangered species protect

"I would like to thank my opponent, for accepting this very contriversal debate. ""As many life forms are harmful to human well-being, it is downright silly to say we should preserve the world's biodiversity. We want to exterminate Aids viruses, bacteria that cause tuberculosis, malaria plasmodia that kill millions of children annually, and countless other harmful pathogens. So it is, too, with black rats and locusts. Our welfare relates directly to eliminating harmful forms of life and we are unavoidably committed to modifying our environments to suit our particular needs. Common sense calls for accepting that in many cases, this means exterminating some of its elements. The challenge conservationists face is to keep them as few as possible, and avoiding dogmatic and palpably insupportable claims that all must be preserved."" -Ian Parker ""-Oh yeah ? So why not extend this concept further and include weak humans too ? I mean we should be killing off humans that have disabilities, after all they would die in the natural course in nature anyway"" Do you consider weak humans as an endangered species? This whole statement is a different debate,therefore is irrelevant to the resolution: We should be trying to prevent species from becoming extinct. 'More species have disappeared from our planet than there are now. Its a natural process. I think that what lays behind the idea of saving endangered species is the wise notion that nature (like anything else) should be treated with respect. Beyond that...you are on a mission..and motivation is less ecological than psychological' ""-Every single animal alive may have a vital role in our eco-system that we don't even know about yet, therefore we must preserve them all."" 'Well, look at it this way, the species that are not gone, outnumber the ones that we have about 50 to one. What if you save one, that should have died out, and in that species, say the green monkey from Africa, there is a disease, lets call it HIV, and this disease jumps from monkey to people, the monkeys are immune people aren't. Millions start to die, millions more die, how many should die before we see what a mistake was made.' No matter how noble your intentions are in saving endangered species is, it doesn't justify the means you go about doing it. Saving endangered species is a perfect modern example of the ends justify the means. The most unconstitutional law we have in the books is the endangered species act.

Protecting endangered species protects the interests of humans	This argument fails to take into account the costs of protecting endangered species and weigh them against the potential harms of them becoming extinct. In a world where only 5% of plant species have been surveyed for their potential medicinal value,[1] this means protecting the survival of the other 95% purely for the potential value that only a fraction of them may possess. All of this means denying development human development now, by not opening areas up for agriculture or not constructing housing. These are very real costs which impact upon peoples' lives, and may even outweigh those scientific and medical advances which may or may not be found in currently endangered species.

Individual interaction with exotic animals face to face, allows an experience that promotes wonder to enter our lives. Without the wonder of the encounters that they experience, people will quickly lose interest in safeguarding the few wild places that are left in our world. Exhibits and programs about earth's aquatic ecosystems also become important parts of most zoos public-education efforts.

73	Scee72b1d-A4ba3f04a	0	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	endangered species protected	endangered species protect

I, as much as anyone, want to live in a perfect world, however, this vision is sadly childish. It is childish to assume possible that mankind putting a hand in crafting their own perfect species balance would be inconsequential and it is childish to consider underpopulation of animals to be the sole cause of an imperfect world. Both are impractical. If, for one happy second, underpopulation was the only problem in the world, then my opponents perfect world argument would be valid. However, it is not valid because the survival of endangered species will not grant world peace nor end world hunger, so it cannot be said that protecting those weaker than us will bring about a perfect world. Also, my opponent's natural selection contradiction is invalid as well. Natural selection is a very large part in the survival of species and certain species survive due to number and survival instincts. If a breed of earth worm was to spend the majority of its time on top of the soil, collecting berries and aphids, then natural selection would inevitably end that species. However, worms spend the majority of their time underground, ensuring their survival. That is how natural selection works.

73	S565efbe-Afe8e267e	2	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Critically Endangered Animals should be sent to sanctuaries	Their Benefit and ImportanceAccording to Scientific American, tons of wildlife reserves are actively trying to increase dwindling populations of endangered animal species. Several across North America participate in the ‘Association of Zoos and Aquarium’s Species Survival Plan program, which, by the name, you can preempt is a movement for the preservation of wildlife species. The SSP and related programs have been reported to bring back many critically endangered species back into the wild, as the objective is to reintroduce them back into their natural habitats. These species include black-footed ferrets, red wolves, and California Condors. But why is this needed? Why do humans need to take accountability for the decrease in population of animal species? This is because, as you can see in my third source, almost all of the major reasons for animal extinction are because of humans. Without sanctuaries, animals simply cannot fight for survival on their own. While poaching and habitat destruction laws have been put in place, I believe that nature reserves currently conserve the most endangered species right now. This is because humans will be humans. Illegal poaching is extremely prominent today, and trees are constantly being cut down for pencils, paper, and woodwork. However, let’s go into more depth about illegal poaching. According to my fourth source (WWF), illegal poaching and wildlife crime has spiked over the years, and those found guilty are given light sentences. In fact, this new trend threatens to overturn years of wildlife conservation. Rhino poaching has gone from 13 (2007) to 1,004 (2013), which is a 7,700% difference. The exploitation of elephants and tigers is also well known.We need wildlife sanctuaries and zoos because this is what endangered species in the wild are facing up against. The legal system simply isn’t enough to prevent certain animals from going extinct, and sanctuaries around the world have taken the initiative to try and fix humanity’s impact on wildlife. This is why, as I’ve explained earlier, it’s so important for such sanctuaries to exist. Not only would several animal species most likely suffer without them (would the black-footed ferrets ever have returned to wildlife with a healthy population?), but it’s important for humans to be responsible for other humans’ actions.

"The extinction of species is part of the nature, so there is no point for human to make efforts to protect endagered speicies. ""-since the whole idea behind the natural process is to kill off the weak to allow the strong to survive."" 'No species on earth would put the interest of another species above its own, so why should human beings be any different? Furthermore, since the very beginnings of life, Nature has operated by the Darwinian principle of ""survival of the fittest"". Life forms that cannot keep up with the newest species on the block will always risk extinction, unless they adapt to the new challenge. Man has no obligation to save the weaker species; if they cannot match our pace, they deserve to die out and be supplanted by others.' ""Another important aspect of preserving endangered species is the importance they bare or may bare on scientific research, many times this research leads to the benefit of the well being of humans."" Since you have chosen to show examples of species that are benefitting the well being of humans, I shall show examples of species that are hazardous to humans. 'How would you like to be sitting at the beach watching your kids play in the water when a wolf comes out of the brush and starts going after each of your kids. Helplessly, these kids fought for their lives as a lone wolf caused havoc biting six people on a rampage. This event happened up in Canada just last week. The wolf was later found and killed by wildlife officials.' (http://blog.kingsoutdoorworld.com...) 'The girl was playing Friday in a sandbox at Alterra Park in Chino Hills in San Bernardino County. Around 10:30 a.m., the caretaker heard screaming and saw a coyote trying to carry the child off in its mouth, officials said.'(http://www.foxnews.com...) 'Mosquitoes Malaria is transmitted by the bite of an infective female anopheline mosquito. It occurs mainly in the summer and especially during years of good rainfall. Anti-malaria tablets should be taken before going into a potential malaria zone. In areas where malaria has become chloroquine-resistant, alternative drugs should be used. Pregnant women should avoid malarial areas. Mosquitoes feed from dusk to the early hours of the morning. Camp on heights such as hills where a cool wind blows and where the grass is not very thick, away from standing water and not near densely vegetated areas at pans or rivers. Sleep under a mosquito net and use mosquito repellants. Fire and smoke help, and burning Elephant or cattle dung apparently drives mosquitoes away. The symptoms appear approximately 12 days after the infective bite. Early symptoms include fever, chills, sweating and headache. Prompt treatment is essential even in mild cases, since irreversible complications may appear suddenly. If the early symptoms are not recognised, the victim may become critically ill with cerebral malaria. Bilharzia When visiting areas where Bilharzia (Schistosomiasis) is found, contact with contaminated water should be avoided. Bilharzia is found in shallow water that is stagnant or flowing slowly, along the banks of rivers, dams and pools, and especially where plants are growing in the water. If you wet yourself with contaminated water, clean yourself immediately by rigorously rubbing yourself dry with a cloth. The parasite may penetrate the skin within minutes. Contaminated water should be boiled or purified before being used for drinking or washing. Bilharzia infection can be severely debilitating and unpleasant and is not easily cured. In rare cases it can go to the brain, with lethal results. As the skin is penetrated, the first symptoms may be a skin reaction, although this may be mild or may not even show. Other symptoms include persistent fatigue, bodily discomfort, fever and vague intestinal complaints. If in doubt, a doctor should be consulted. Tsetse-fly The tsetse-fly, which transmits sleeping-sickness, has been virtually eliminated in southern Africa and only small populations exist. The fly can inflict a painful bite, and the symptoms of the disease, which include headache and a fever, develop after about two weeks. Bees and wasps With repeated exposure to stings, some people become hypersensitive, after which another sting could be much worse, if not fatal. People allergic to bee and wasp venoms should not wear floral-scented cosmetics or nail varnish. The solvent (amyl acetate) in nail varnish is the alarm pheromone of bees and provokes aggression. Don't wear brightly patterned clothes. If bees are about, remain calm and move slowly. Ticks The symptoms of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever include a sudden onset with fever, malaise, weakness, irritability, headache, severe pain in limbs and loins, and marked anorexia. Vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea occurs occasionally. Soft ticks If bitten, hypersensitised individuals risk anaphylactic shock, which can result in death. And , spiders.'

Also, ""-Finally, an example of species providing for scientific discoveries is the instance of the Pacific yew which ""became the source of taxol, one of the most potent anticancer compounds ever discovered"" (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p. 418-419)."" Modern science has advanced to the point where inspiration from Nature is no longer required. Today, medicines derived from natural products are in the minority.

She referenced the Bible as a reason for the preservation of animals. Seeing as this is not a commonly accepted source of fact and is widely disputed, it should not be taken into consideration as evidence. ========================= I agree that in a perfect world, we should preserve those species weaker than us. However, it is not a perfect world. Any human interactions with the environment should be closely monitored. Everything is connected in the ecosystem and anything changed will affect another aspect of it. Say a brown bellied swallow was becoming extinct. We breed two together to preserve the species and they become numerous. Unfortunately, the favorite meal of this bird is the red herring. This fish becomes endangered because of the overpopulation of this bird. In result of this fish's thinning population, numerous other species begin to die out because of their reliance of having it in their diets. Everything in the ecosystem is in a precarious balance. Secondly, it is only natural selection. Some species are weaker than others and, in result, they do not survive. Hundreds of species are thought to have become extinct long before humans came along. It is simply a part of life and an unfortunate part of the world. It would be almost selfish to allow one weak species to survive while consequently harming others just because we would feel bad not having this species around any more. Lastly, my opponent says that ""if we did not protect the animals of the earth, there would be none left"". The ecosystem does a remarkably good job of maintaining itself. Humans aren't the only thing that keeps species alive, but are, rather, one of the largest factors to their endangerment via home production, hunting, and logging. I conclude by saying that it is not our ""responsibility to protect the weaker species"" but more our responsibility to allow nature to run its course."

Protecting endangered species can harm human communities	Protecting endangered species can harm humans: Protecting endangered species by definition means restricting activity that humans would otherwise want to do, be it by turning woodland into farmland, turning meadows into housing developments, or by preventing us from eliminating 'pest' species which kill livestock or damage crops. For example, the reintroduction of the grey wolf into Yellowstone Park has increased once more the risk to livestock in the region and caused economic harms to ranchers there.[1] Some of these species may even pose a threat to human lives, which may have been why they were hunted to extinction in the first place. In any case, less agricultural land and less land for housing can only mean higher food and housing costs (due to their decreased supplies in the face of a rising human population) for people, which has a detrimental impact upon human life.

Your argument regarding migration seems to be nothing more than, ""migration, so there."" You've given no reason for me to believe such conditions cause suffering. Zoo keepers must have the resources to provide comfortable environments for the animals. Sure, they are largely synthetic, but this doesn't necessarily cause pain. Take the elephant in a zoo. It doesn't need to migrate in search of food. It gets all of the food it needs. It's true that they have no freedom, or very little, at that. They are constantly watched and enclosed. This would surely be a miserable environment - for a human. Animals, however, don't share the human sense of shame. They don't look out at the world with longing for a better life.

Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	endangered species protected	endangered species protect
73	S565efbe-Af12ef8f4	2	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Critically Endangered Animals should be sent to sanctuaries	The Contender argued that we should not try and save a species if it can no longer exist in its natural habitat. This is simply illogical. What if this animal provides some sort of service to humans or the world? An analogy would be bees and agriculture; in several scenarios, species that sanctuaries try to save, in our perception, need to be saved. It doesn’t even end there. What would happen to their food chain? The effects of this animal’s loss in their ecosystem could lead to the further extinction of several other animal, plant and insect species. As there are several more reasons, I advise you to look at my first source.While you use evolution to support your argument, this, despite your perception is subjective.I also question the validity of “The only way to revive a species is to either eliminate the threat to its survival or relocate it to another place where that threat is eliminated.” Firstly, the main way these sanctuaries aim to reintroduce select animals back into their habitat is by breeding; the objective is to set a sustainable population for critically endangered species. Eliminating the animal’s habitual threat is commonly a legal matter (poaching laws, etc.), so this can’t be used against nature reserves. While I agree this is an issue, I don’t believe it deflates the purpose of an animal sanctuary (also, the thylacine is extinct, so reserves couldn’t try to save it anyways).I disagree; with Google searches I’ve concluded that it’s simply not as easy (and in fact extremely unlikely) for poachers to ‘illegally enter’ wildlife reserves for the purpose of hunting animals. I couldn’t find any online, and, according to Wikipedia, nature reserves are “protected areas”. With the resources available I find your argument illogical and not well-backed.Finally, your whale point doesn’t have anything to do with this debate. I’ve seen SeaWorld documentaries, sure, but that doesn’t fit with my definition (see opening statement) of a sanctuary. A pool in a stadium with a plethora of cheering humans is not similar to it’s natural habitat at all. The wildlife reservations I’m arguing for can clearly be observed, again, in r1. These sanctuaries are big, meet all of the species requirements, and almost have no real ramification on the animal’s growth or lifestyle (your captivity point).Sources:(1) http://simplyeducate.me...(2) https://en.wikipedia.org...

73	S7ca7fa50-A15db47da	1	1	Should endangered species be protected?	animal captivity	"I accept. As Con, I will be arguing that the house should not keep animals in captivity. Before I begin, I would first like to define a term for clarity. Captivity is defined as ""the condition of being imprisoned or confined"" by the Oxford dictionary. [1] Now I will first rebut some of Pro's points. 1. ""zoos save endangered species by bringing them into a safe environment, where they are protected from habitat loss, starvation and predators"" First of all, a zoo is not a safe environment for any animals. Captive animals are deprived of their natural environment. A cramped cage filled with artificial environment is not a safe place for animals. They cannot be protected from habitat loss because they have already lost their habitat by being placed in Zoos. Some of the food Zoos provide may fit the animals. Predators are part of nature and humans do not have rights to change nature. 2. ""many zoos also have breeding program for endangered species, but in the wild, these individuals might have trouble finding mates and breeding"" Reasonable statement. However, instead of simply placing endangered animals in captivity, we should spend our effort trying to prevent further species from becoming endangered. If a species is endangered, that means the availability of those species has decreased dramatically. Zoologists may not have enough empirical information to provide a safe, suitable circumstances for those species to mate. Now I will present some of my arguments. 1. Better use of money Holding animals captive cost a lot of money. Millions of dollars spent on holding animals captive can be instead spent on conserving environment and allowing animals to enjoy safe and natural habitat without being held captive. 2. Freedom Even if zoos have some benefits, they cost animals the one thing that they have: freedom. How would you feel if some organisms suddenly captured you and put you in a cramped cage filled with artificial and fake houses. They may feed you things that you may not like but in order to survive, you will have to eat whatever they give you. You are stared by thousands of strangers every day who may yell and shout at you. This is the life animals that are in captive have to go through every day. I will present more arguments next round. I await Pro's arguments and rebuttals. [1] http://www.oxforddictionaries.com..."

73	S7a7d096f-Ab6341100	2	1	Should endangered species be protected?	Humanity owes a moral responsibility to future generations	By this argument, no human generation could ever decide that protecting a species is more trouble than its worth and so let it become extinct, as there would always be the theoretical possibility of a future generation that might regret this choice. Every choice we make as a generation constrains and widens the choices available to future generations. If we protect endangered species and therefore limit agricultural and housing land (to protect their environments) we deny future generations more plentiful food supplies and better housing. We may even deny the existence of more humans in the future by not having enough food to feed a population which could grow faster if the food supply was greater. We cannot allow the remote possibility of future regret to cause us to take actions which a great many people will 'regret' in the present.	CON	endangered species protected	endangered species protect
73	S2c813efa-A97c94a4	0	0	Should endangered species be protected?	The user known as Danielle used dishonest tactics in her same-sex parenting debate.	"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	endangered species protected	endangered species protect

"Not all zoos can be sizes of savannas so they must rationalize the amount of space given to each animal. So you must understand if a leopard can't get 12-30 sq. miles of space. But, zoos do have to divide that space rationally. God also told us in Genesis 1:26-28 that we have dominion over animal and that we can take it upon ourselves for food, and several other things like education, etc. Those veterinarians help those animals in the zoo get better. ""Zoos, as we will see below, exist to protect endangered species and to help us understand and protect our animal cousins more successfully. One of the reasons animals are taken into captivity in zoos is because they are under threat if they stay in their natural habitat. There have in the past been many bad zoos and cruel zookeepers. It is imperative that these are reformed and weeded out. Good zoos in which animals are well fed and well looked after in spacious surroundings are becoming the norm and should be encouraged. Zoos can exist without cruelty to animals, however, and so the fact that there are animal welfare problems with some zoos does not meant that all zoos should be shut down. Zoos nowadays are not marketed as places of entertainment - they are places of education. Most modern zoos have their main emphasis on conservation and education - the reason that so many schools take children to zoos is to teach them about nature, the environment, endangered species, and conservation. Far from encouraging bad treatment of animals, zoos provide a direct experience of other species that will increase ecological awareness One of the main functions of zoos is to breed endangered animals in captivity. If natural or human factors have made a species' own habitat a threatening environment then human intervention can preserve that species where it would certainly go extinct if there were no intervention. There are certainly problems with trying to conserve endangered species in this way but it is right that we should at least try to conserve them. And as long as animals are treated well in zoos there is no reason why conservation, education, and cruelty-free entertainment should not all be combined in a zoo.""

Aesthetics	An environment with a great diversity of plant and animal species in it can act as a source for art and entertainment, enriching the lives of humans. Thus the preservation of endangered species is an important part of ensuring this diversity continues to exist so people and enjoy and be inspired by the many varied kinds of life on this earth. A good example of this is the re-introduction of the grey wolf into Yellowstone Park in the United States (where it had previously become extinct due to human action), which added to the biodiversity of the region and caused a greater influx of tourists into the park.[1] People enjoy being surrounded by different kinds of nature, and so protecting endangered species is an important part of protecting human enjoyment.

73	S8259e846-A7a2ab477	2	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Resolved: It is immoral not to extend rights to living animals.	I affirm. Definitions:immoral - conforming to standards of bad behaviorextend - to expand in effectrights - the abilities to live and be free from sufferingliving animals - animals who can respond to their environmentsMy standard is NET BENEFITS FOR HUMANS AND ANIMALS. This is a fair framework that gives the Pro and Con sides equal access to the ballot. Thus, the winner of this debate should be the one who creates the most benefits for humans AND animals.My plan is that we uphold the Endangered Species Act. The ESA is a law passed by President Nixon that protects endangered and threatened species. Upholding the ESA is one of many ways we can extend rights to living animals; thus, it should be valid for this public-forum-type debate. Without the ESA, fewer rights would be extended to animals because many of them would become extinct or extirpated. The way I achieve the resolution is by proving that it is immoral NOT to extend the Endangered Species Act.The Pro burden is that failure to extend the Endangered Species Act does more harm than good (as dictated by my definition of “immoral” and by my plan).The Con burden is that extending basic rights to animals does overwhelmingly more harm than good for humans and animals (the framework of the debate).Contention 1: The Endangered Species Act is economically beneficial. The United States is economically desperate, making any method of recovery a “good behavior”. Subpoint A: The Act provides millions of dollars each year for local communities. A 2006 study by the University of Montana found that the return of wolves to Yellowstone brings an estimated $35 million in tourist revenue and DOUBLE that after cycling through the local economy. Moreover, the total economic value of maintaining healthy ecosystems in four Florida cities transcends $3 billion. Local governments have a moral obligation to provide their citizens with good schooling and sufficient opportunities; the capacity to do this is suppressed if the Endangered Species Act is not upheld. Subpoint B: The Act provides economic advantages on a national level. According to Defenders of Wildlife, wildlife-related recreation generated more than $120 billion in 2006. In addition, wildlife watching generated almost $45 billion and provided over 860,000 private secotr jobs. Finally, visitors to national parks spend $28 billion on fishing, hunting, and hiking, leading to more than 400,000 private and public sector jobs. The U.S. is currently handicapped by an unemployment rate of about 8 percent. To fix this and inherently improve the quality of life for citizens, the Endangered Species Act should be protected. Subpoint C: The Endangered Species Act promotes human productivity. Annual benefits from ecosystem services total $33 billion in soil maintenance and $30 billion from insect pollination. Moreover, some keystone species benefit human health. The pacific yew tree, for example, has led to the development of a natural cancer-treatment drug. Another example is the Gila monster lizard, which ahs been used to alleviate the effects of diabetes. Thus, the Endangered Species Act continues to play a vital role. By protecting the basic rights of critical species like crocodiles, fish, and bears, diseases can be prevented, increasing the overall productivity, stability, and competitiveness of various nations. It is simply immoral not to strive for these qualities.Contention Two: Extending rights to animals improves human health. National governments are morally obligated to protect the lives of their citizens, as mandated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Subpoint A: Dependence on ecosystems. When a species becomes endangered because it has been deprived of its ability to live, the ecosystem slowly falls apart. Humans depend on healthy ecosystems for purify their own environment. Without ecosystems of living animals, humans would lose access to clean air, water, and land. The ability to enjoy opportunities and contribute to important causes improves if humans have access to basic necessities like these. The only way to ensure that is if animals are given a few basic rights. Subpoint B: Medical. According to States United for Biomedical Research, the armadillo has been responsible for a treatment against leprosy to be treated in all areas of the world in which leprosy is still prevalent. Another example is bats, which, according to scientists from Texas, could substantially increase human lifespan. Some hypotheses are made about fruit flies and their potential to unlock the mystery of Alzheimer’s. Others reveal that the gila monster can help control glucose levels and allow people to lose weight. The fact that the list extends beyond these examples shows that giving living animals some basic rights to live independently signify substantial paveways for human enhancement and life. Contention Three: Animals have complex thought, assimilating them closely with humans. First, Human beings are complex, evolved creatures who are afforded rights on the grounds that they can think and feel pain. Other animals, like dolphins, dogs, jaguars, bats, hawks, and giraffes, can think and feel pain. It is immoral to extend rights to some entities that can think but not to others. Equality is the keystone of many moral systems internationally, and it can only be pursued if animals have at least one or two of the fundamental rights that humans, a type of animal, enjoy for themselves. Second, compassion is a much more reasonable alternative to self-interest. Tigers, crabs, and parrots cannot drive automobiles and do not play chess with one another. Humans are superior to animals in many respects. With this disparity of power, they could use it to help or harm animals. Using the benefits of a human mind to harm other animals is analogous to a self-centered refusal to help the poor. It is a good behavior to be mindful of our peers and a bad behavior to abuse them simply because they cannot generate counter-attacks.Contention Four: Not extending rights to living animals is inconsistent with our intuitions. First, the evolutionary attachment of humans to other animals demands that other animals receive the respect of “rights”. Ever since the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species in 1859, it has been concluded and accepted that human beings are related by common descent to all other animals. Failure to care for an ape or ostrich is analogous to failure to care for a cousin or sister-in-law. Furthermore, not extending these basic rights to life and freedom from pain violates the concept of reciprocity. For example, dogs are known for developing a bond with humans, respecting their rights and avoiding to bite or injure them. When dogs and other pets respect human beings as entities in nature, they enter with humans into a social contract. The animals that are capable of respecting basic human rights are the same ones that should be respected by humans. Finally, cruelty to animals is the sign of an uncivilized society. It encourages violence and barbarism in society. A society that respects animals and restrains base instincts is by definition more civilized. Since civility is a good behavior, and bad behavior defines morality, it is simply immoral not to extend very rudimentary rights to animals.I would like to reiterate my burdens in today’s debate. I must prove that upholding the Endangered Species Act is more “right” than “wrong”, because that is my plan; it is one way to achieve the resolution while advocating something that is practical and balanced. I do NOT have to prove that the utilization of animals for hunting or food is wrong. Since the Endangered Species Act can still be upheld with the production of meat, hunting of common birds, etc., any arguments that do not refute my plan of upholding the Endangered Species Act are invalid unless they support a counter-plan offered by the Con.I ask Con to follow the expectations I set forth in Round 1.Thus, I affirm.

73	S7a7d096f-A44f5b62c	1	1	Should endangered species be protected?	"The term ""endangered"" is inconsistently applied"	The practical difficulties of the 'endangered' status: The complications which have grown up surrounding the 'endangered' status given to some species are in themselves a good reason to do away with this cumbersome and harmful practice. It should firstly be noted that it can be incredibly difficult to get species removed from the 'protected' lists even once they have been added even when their numbers show they are no longer in jeopardy. The grey wolf again serves as a good example; it is considered to be 'endangered' (and thus protected) in the United States, as there are only 3,700 such wolves in the lower 48 States today, despite the fact that an estimated 58,000 grey wolves live in the wild in Alaska and Canada.[1] This is clearly an example of a misapplication of the 'endangered' label but which is incredibly difficult to revoke once it has been given, due to pressure from ecological groups and the media. The sort of laws used to 'protect' endangered species may even incentivize the exact opposite kind of behaviour on the part of landowners. When, for example, a farmer finds on his land an animal from an endangered species, and the law thus requires him to make significant changes to his farming practices to protect the creature, this imposes a significant economic cost on him. This means that that farmer may have a large economic incentive to simply dispose of the creature and hide the evidence of its presence, when in the absence of the law the farmer might not take any steps to intentionally exterminate all examples of that endangered species on his land. Economists writing in the Journal of Law and Economics found an example of similarly perverse incentives provided by endangered species protection law amongst logging companies in the United States. When faced with a protected species of woodpecker which preferred to nest in trees at least 70 years old, and which when found, the law required timber owners not to harvest wood within a large area around that woodpecker's nest, loggers simply responded by harvesting more trees in areas where these woodpeckers might appear and by intentionally harvesting tees at age 40 instead of waiting for them to mature to 70 and thus becoming potential habitats for the woodpeckers. This resulted in even less available habitat for the woodpeckers than before the protection laws were passed[2] This example helps to further illustrate how 'protecting' endangered species requires cumbersome legislation that is prone to mistakes, difficult to retract and may incentivize even more harmful behaviour towards these species than if the laws did not exist.

73	S7a7d096f-A3c4f44b	2	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Protecting endangered species protects the interests of humans	Protecting endangered species helps protect humans: Humans actually benefit in a large number of ways from the protection of endangered species and thus continuing biodiversity. Firstly, the diversity of life and living systems is considered by many scientists to be a necessary condition for human development. We live in a world built on a carefully balanced ecosystem in which all species play a role, and the removal of species from this can cause negative consequences for the whole ecosystem, including humans.[1] There is also the potential for almost any species to hold currently-unknown future benefits to humans through products they could provide. One example of this is the scrub mint, an endangered plant species which has been found to contain an anti-fungal agent and a natural insecticide, and thus holds great potential for use that benefits humans.[2] Endangered species have also been known to hold the key to medical breakthroughs which save human lives.  One example of this is the Pacific yew (a tree species) which became the source of taxol, one of the most potent anticancer compounds ever discovered.[3] Biodiversity also helps protect humans in that different species' differing reactions to ecological problems may in fact act as a kind of 'early warning' system of developing problems which may one day negatively affect people. This was the case with the (now banned) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pesticide, as the deterioration of the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon through their exposure to DDT in fact alerted humans to the potential health hazards of this pesticide, not just to animals but also to humans.[4] Thus the preservation of endangered species helps to protect humans, as this means plants and animals continue to play their specific role in the world's ecosystem which humans rely on, can act as an 'early warning' for problems which may affect humans, and may hold the key to scientific and medical breakthroughs which can greatly benefit humanity. Al this could be lost through the careless extinction of plant and animal species. [1] Ishwaran, N., & Erdelen, W. “Biodiversity Futures”, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3[4].

73	S4c3696b4-A4dc6108c	0	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Team Debate: All Animals Should be released from zoos	Introduction: Thank you Solon and Lee for undertaking this debate with us! We think that it will prove to be very exciting, and a learning process for both of us. Team Debates are an excellent way to improve strategy and look at things through different perspectives. Good luck, and may the best debater(s) win! Contention 1 - Endangered Animals: Throughout the world, more and more species are coming under a constant threat . Whether it may be from climate change, human hunting, or predatory overpopulation, the list of endangered species is growing larger. If intense recovery efforts are not put into place throughout the world, we risk the danger of many species becoming extinct/endangered. Zoos are an increasingly viable option in the preservation of animal species around the globe. Under the watchful eye of scientists and veterinarians who are experts in animal species, animals with a decreasing population can be rehabilitated in a safe environment. An example of a working measure to rehabilitate endangered species is the (2) Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Dozens of Zoos across North America are joining the efforts of AZA’s Species Survival Plan (SSP). In the past three decades, the SSP has been able to bring back dwindling populations of: black-footed ferrets, Californian Condors, red wolves, and several other species. Not only does this system preserve animal populations, but it also starts a resurging movement within their species. Another benefit of having dwindling populations preserved in zoos is that scientists are able to use the SSP as a research tool to understand the biology and populatory dynamics of endangered animal species. Utilizing this hard evidence, scientists can effectively use this data to ensure the survivability of these species for decades to come, by breeding them in safe environments and protecting them from unnatural hazards. Using zoos as a staging ground, endangered species can be brought from the brink and made a thriving population. Contention 2 - Habitat Some, if not most animals are born and raised in zoos. Releasing them into the wild could be potentially catastrophic since they do not know how to hunt for their own food and survive in the wild. The animals in zoos require the aid of zoos to live in and without them they have no skills to survive in the wild (3) .By releasing animals from zoos you are ultimately sentencing masses of animals to their deaths - on a global scale! Since the resolution states the word: ‘all’, this means that we are not just talking about zoos in the UK and America, we are talking about zoos all over the world. Zoos are essential and some of the world’s best best zoos. “ The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa is sporting some big attractions. The zoo fills up their 210-acre space with one of the largest exotic tree collections, a massive aquarium and hundreds of different animal species. Its breeding programs and research have been so successful that almost all the animals in the zoo were born on the grounds.” This proves that we cannot simply release all animals to their natural habitat, they do not know anywhere other than the zoo (4) . To conclude this contention, I have demonstrated that releasing all animals to their natural habitat is not a good idea and would be mass slaughter of all endangered, injured Contention 3 - Education School children are naturally curious about animals (5) and see them everywhere in their daily lives, and an opportunity to go to the zoo and see them up close is an amazing experience for them. With this opportunity, they learn about animals and endangered species. Zoos have added signs to most places (6) where animals are located in order to inform people about them too, including their natural habitat, how many there still are in the world, what they eat, and so on (6). Not only school children, but everyone can be informed about animals at zoos, as they raise awareness towards important issues about animals and some good zoos tell us what we can do to help (5). Contention 4 - Economy It has been revealed that American zoos and aquariums contribute $16 billion (7) annually! This the economic impact that zoos bring to America annually. This money is used to help in a number of ways by the American government and a percentage of this money made goes to help improve the zoos quality and helps to keep endangered animals protected. As well as the money related economic impacts, zoos also create jobs for the population. In America alone, zoos have created 142,000 jobs for people. If you propose that we release all animals from zoos then you must also be proposing that we get rid of all these workers. Whilst it is true that some of them may get jobs elsewhere, some of these workers will evidently be rendered unemployed, with no source of income. 5.5% of the USA are unemployed (8)! The US has roughly 320 million citizens (10). If you work out how much 5.5% of that is you will get the approximate answer of 17 million (9) US citizens (If jobs were easy to find then there wouldn’t be 17 million unemployed. By making the decision to release all animals from zoos, you are effectively making the decision to not only wipe out endangered species but you are also sentencing the government to bankruptcy and the workers to unemployment. Conclusion In all of our arguments we have written, we have discussed and provided tangible evidence as to why our arguments are sound and can be proven with empirical evidence. We are looking forward to reading your contentions and thank you once again for undertaking this debate with us, and we now hand it over to you.Sources(1) http://nationalzoo.si.edu...(2) http://www.scientificamerican.com...(3) http://occupytheory.org...(4) http://mom.me...(5) http://www.caledonia.ednet.ns.ca...(6) http://occupytheory.org...(7) https://www.aza.org...(8) https://www.google.co.uk...(9) http://www.percentagecalculator.net...(10) http://www.usnews.com...;	CON	endangered species protected	endangered species protect

They are meant as a place to have kids learn about animals they may have not seen before. Kids can more easily learn about something if they see it up close. Opening arguments. 1: Zoos keep endangered animals, like Asian elephants, and the giant panda. A variety of international and U.S. laws offer protection to endangered species. Depending on the law, it may be a crime to capture or kill listed species, fail to act to recover them, or harm their habitat or range. The Endangered Species Act lists more than 1,200 U.S. plant and animal species as endangered or threatened with the possibility of becoming endangered. The law requires recovery plans to ultimately delist species. The IUCN-World Conservation Union maintains a record""the Red List""of the world's species that are threatened with extinction. The Red List now includes 16,928 species""more than 8,400 animals and more than 8,400 plants""that are critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable. Signed by more than 160 countries, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an agreement to restrict trade of more than 30,000 species of animals and plants, including live and dead specimens (such as marmosets) and parts (such as ivory). Other laws and treaties""such as the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles""have a narrower focus. 2: Like I said before, A new international study of zoos and aquariums shows that these family attractions do teach the public about the delicate balance between animal species and their habitats. Sociologist Eric Jensen from the University of Warwick worked with Andy Moss from Chester Zoo and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) on the largest study of its kind to assess if these facilities did achieve their public education goals. information from: 1: http://nationalzoo.si.edu... 2: http://www2.warwick.ac.uk..."

73	Sf2236edc-Adf1bb750	0	1	Should endangered species be protected?	Should we hunt animals	This is were there is a fine line to walk, most animals have a season or a time when it is legal to hunt them, this period of culling is typically in the winter after they have breed giving the yearlings time to mature. And most hunters will shoot for the elder animals this keep the next generation going. However without hunting it leads to overpopulation in time, which pare that with the limited space available for them will cause them to move, possibly into urban areas which is dangerous for both the animal, and the people living there. The hunting which is limited keeps the animals within the carrying capacity of the environment they find themselves in. And for your endangered animals argument don't get hunting confused with poaching which is illegal and a disgusting practice.	PRO	endangered species protected	endangered species protect
73	S63f183db-Aa2d87979	0	2	Should endangered species be protected?	It should be legal to take large snakes across state lines	"I would like to start by thanking Pro for his round. ClarificationThe resolution is: It should be legal to take large snakes across state lines.As Con, I will be arguing that it should not be legal to take large snakes across state lines. Additionally, since Pro is attempting to challenge the status quo, the majority of the burden rests on him. ArgumentsI. The Necessity and Justification of The Lacey Act.The current law against taking large snakes across state lines is known as The Lacey Act:""Under the Lacey Act, it is unlawful to import, export, sell, acquire, or purchase fish, wildlife or plants that are taken, possessed, transported, or sold: 1) in violation of U.S. or Indian law, or 2) in interstate or foreign commerce involving any fish, wildlife, or plants taken possessed or sold in violation of State or foreign law."" [1]On March 23, 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services had a ban enacted under this law which covered the importation and interstate transportation of four large snakes: The Burmese python, (Python molurus bivittatus) [2] The northern (Python sebae) and southern African rock pythons, (Python natalensis) [2] and the yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus) [2] The rule will specifically prohibit the interstate transport and importation live snakes, their viable reproductive assets such as sperm and eggs, or any hybrids of the listed snakes. The rule does not restrict the sales of these snakes within a state as long as buyers don't try to transport the snakes across state lines. [2] So why were these snakes added to the ""banned list"" under the Lacey Act? The answer is simple- They are a threat to the natural surroundings, including humans, protected habitats, and other endangered species. In an NPR interview with the head of U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Dan Ashe, when asked why the four species were added to the banned list gave the following response: ""DAN ASHE: We've seen the Burmese python threatening 41 federal and state-listed threatened and endangered species. In Florida, we have seen the virtual eradication of small mammals."" [3] When a non-native species of snake like the Burmese Python moves into an environment like the Everglades in South Florida, it's a recipe for disaster. With essentially no predators to threaten them, they can go about their business hunting and destroying the remaining species around them in this new home as the Apex Predator. It's this same scenario that presents itself for the other species listed as well. Each of them pose a significant threat to their surrounding environments, such as some pythons being found with an entire deer inside it: If that snake can swallow a deer, it can easily swallow a child, pet, or any sort of protected and endangered species that might come across its path. These aren't just horror stories, this is the reality, and as a resident of South Florida myself, the problem has become so great that we've already experienced between an 85% to 100% reduction in our mid-sized mammals like raccoons, foxes, bobcats, and opossums. [4] Those are just mid-sized mammals though. Can you imagine the larger things these snakes can eat once they grow to full size? It's hard to really imagine, unless of course you see the size of some of the larger ones that have been found lately such as the one below: What should we expect to come from these large snakes if we don't have any kind of control over them? One thing we have to keep in mind is that us Floridians are actually trying to stop this issue from spreading north. Most people believe that these snakes can't survive in the North since they flourish so well in the Everglades, but what we must keep in mind is that some of these snakes originate from lands where their native range included the foothills of the Himalayas. [5] We know these snakes can survive cold snaps which south Florida, contrary to popular belief, does experience once or twice a year where the temperature will drop into the low 40's. With this taken into consideration, it's clear that these snakes could easily survive up north, and will eventually be making there way up there once the Everglades is either dried up of food from their constant expansion, or too small for the expanding species to live comfortably. Either way, it will happen sooner rather than later, and the current bans on the import and interstate transportation of such snakes serves to stop such a thing from happening. It's also not that much of a devastating impact on current owners, because if state law permits, most owners of these species would be allowed to keep their existing animals, and would only be prohibited from moving them across state lines. Businesses would be allowed to export the species within their state from designated ports with a permit from the Fish & Wildlife Service. [2] For these reasons, I believe The Lacey Act is here to protect the majority from both harming endangered species and from being harmed by predator species. The addition of these four snakes, among the other countless additions throughout the years, is nothing more than our effort at protecting our immediate selves and environments from harmful species. We can see both the immediate damage and the potential damage that these snakes can and have caused. To reverse the actions taken would only serve to harm those who are at risk, both now and in the future. RebuttalsI. Bad SciencePro claims that ""bad science"" was used when determining what snakes were to be added to the banned list. However, I see no proof whatsoever to back up that claim. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service has been around since 1871 [6]. Throughout the time of its existence and activities, it has largely served as a beneficial entity to the U.S. Government and is one that has instigated hundreds of projects and acts which have saved countless species of animals. To call into question the methods of this institution most certainly requires some form of valid evidence against it. Pro has offered none thus far. II. ""If they travel across state lines to see a vet they become a felon.""My opponent presents a scenario where if a snake owner of one of the banned species needs to see a vet who happens to be on the other side of the state lines he becomes a felon. This isn't wholly accurate though. The FWS (Fish & Wildlife Services) actually does offer special permits for interstate travel in some cases. [7] Regardless, it's not as if the snake owner can't find a vet in his own state. To assume otherwise is just ridiculous. There is no good reason why this should serve to strengthen Pro's side as ultimately it's not something that is really an issue, and is at the very least, an issue that can be easily avoided by simply taking your snake to a vet within your own state. III. ""...transfer out of state and they can't find someone to take the animal in""My opponent presents a final argument posing a scenario where the person has to move out of state and can't find someone to take it in. This is, again, Pro working under the faulty assumption that there are no ways to get around it. As I showed in my previous rebuttal, there are certainly situations where an owner can acquire a special permit to travel. I see no reason why a responsible owner wouldn't be able to take the necessary steps and acquire such a permit. Furthermore, there are countless animal reserves and private collectors who would certainly be able to take the snake in, if it was a worst-case scenario. The option of having to kill it or release it isn't the only choices the snake owner would have. Thus, this argument falls flat as there are several methods to overcome such a scenario. In closing, I have presented an argument which shows both the necessity and justification of the current legal status of these snakes in regards to import and interstate travel bans. Furthermore, I've presented three rebuttals which cover each argument/scenario presented by Pro. I now return the floor to Pro. Thank you.

Humanity owes a moral responsibility to future generations	Human moral responsibility to future generations: Species extinction is an irrevocable occurrence. Outside of the film 'Jurassic Park', extinct species cannot be summoned back from the grave once human action has put them there. This means that when a current generation makes the decision not to protect an endangered species and thus allows human action to drive it to extinction, this denies future generations the ability to make up their own minds about the pros and cons of the survival of that endangered species, especially considering that they might want that species to exist for the aforementioned scientific, medical, aesthetic or moral reasons. For example, there is a great modern-day interest in the dodo species of bird which was hunted to extinction in Mauritius in the 17th Century.[1] The opinion of many in the modern world today is one of regret at the bird's extinction and that it should have been protected, but a lack of consideration of the wishes of future generations in the 17th Century has meant that the humans of the 21st Century are denied the ability to decide on the value of this species themselves. Because we place a moral value on the ability of humans to make decisions (as we consider it to be a good thing when we ourselves have this ability) we should recognise that the possibly differing opinions of future generations should constrain our choices somewhat, and we should protect endangered species so that future generations can decide for themselves regarding their value.

73	Sf0770da-A760eca8e	0	2	Should endangered species be protected?	Homosexual Marriage and Lifestyle: Detrimental and Not Necessarily About Equality.	"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight.

Why not teach kids to wait until they are adults to have sex? Isn't that a better way to go?

Over the last 12 months, 21 percent of both program and control group youth reported having sex and not always using a condom"" [4]. The control group received no sex education of any kind.Secondly, an article posted by two university professors states that abstinence only education ""is limited to teaching that a monogamous, marital, heterosexual relationship is the ""expected standard of human activity"" and that sex outside such a relationship will be physically and psychologically harmful. Abstinence-only education also advocates only one method to prevent disease and pregnancy, abstinence, and it offers no information concerning contraception and disease prevention except that all methods other than abstinence fail. As a result of its singular focus, the curricula not only pose significant problems with respect to ensuring minors"" sexual health, but also ignore the needs of sexual minority youth altogether"" [5].""Well, one study versus the many studies I have is very little evidence against abstinence only programs. Besides, even if it does provide evidence against abstinence only programs, I still have evidence in favor of Abstinence only programs. That right there, is enough to prove abstinence only programs is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Abstinence only programs are ineffective.""Well you are just one person.

It's not the car that makes the car dangerous, the person behind the wheel does. Therefore, if you aren't afraid of getting into an accident everyday driving on the road, you are more suceptible of getting into an accident yourself.""So, I take it that you are just giving up this point?""I wasn't necessarily just giving up this topic, but saying we both should just drop it since it doesn't directly relate to the topic.""What's the point of this? You were asserting that a lack of family values was causing the divorces. Your source cites economic reasons due to women getting an income in this day and age."" Now, look at your comment from the other round.""That is a non-sequitur (without evidence to support either) to say that a lack of family values causes women leaving their husbands, getting abortions, and becoming homosexual. On that last point especially, homosexuality has genetic causes not (or at least as well as) societal ones [5].""http://www.prb.org......Marital Status Among Young Adults Ages 25-34 (Percent)2000 2006 2007 2008 2009 Married 55.1 48.9 48.2 46.9 44.9 Never Married 34.5 41.4 42.6 43.9 46.3If you don't get the picture then I don't know what to tell you.""Well what do you know. Some people that use contraceptives happen to get pregnant, and doesn't it make perfect sense that there might be a decent percentage of pregnant women that used contraceptives. The thing is, is that according to a CDC report: ""The abortion rate for 2009 was 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15""44 years..."" [6]. Your percentages barely make up over 1.5% of women."""""" Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.[8]""This goes to show that ""safe sex"" education just doesn't cut it because people are still making bad decisions, that result in inconvenient consequences. Besides, 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women is a lot more than just 1.5% when it comes to the entire population. We basically aborted an entire country."" Forty-six percent of women who have abortions had not used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant. Of these women, 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for pregnancy, 32% had had concerns about contraceptive methods, 26% had had unexpected sex.""""Why did they perceive themselves as being at a low risk? Was this a form of self-medication, or lack of education, or both? Secondly, what does 'unexpected sex' mean? Is that rape, or a spur-of-the-moment situation. No amount of sexual education would help the former, and the latter is the result of high amounts of hormones that education ay not have much effect in such a situation."" 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for pregnancy26% had had unexpected sexIf you put these two together that is 59%. Why did I do that? If these people had just simply been taught about the risks and consequences they could reap having sex these statistics wouldn't of been near as high according to the studies I've showed. The 32% could of been lower too, but apparently they weren't educated enough about the consequences for their actions. The parents most likely weren't involved in talking to them about sex either.""Well, according to a congressional study: ""...when the average child was just shy of 17, half of both groups had remained abstinent. The sexually active teenagers had sex the first time at about age 15. Less than a quarter of them, in both groups, reported using a condom every time they had sex. More than a third of both groups had two or more partners"" [7]. One group was given abstinence only education, and the other group had no education. This study was done in both rural and urban communities, showing that the results have relevance to the majority of the country.As for your other source...""...the authors urged caution in interpreting these numbers due to the small sample size.[41]""...It practically refutes itself.""Evidence can't refute it's self, whether big or small. It is still evidence and still a fact. Like I've stated before, the fact I do have plenty of evidence that shows Abstinence programs as being sucessfull in any kind of way proves abstinence programs are in fact sucessful. Therefore, I have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that abstinence programs are sucessful one way or another, despite your findings that abtinence programs aren't sucessful. The fact remains our government is micromanaging our education and should use ANY preventative sex program that is sucessfull. I also have evidence from plenty of different studies that show success. Being that there is MANY studies that have proved my point, this is overwhelming evidence for my argument. This shouldn't go overlooked and should be evident. I could post many more studies that have been done on abstinence progreams, but I feel that would be overkill. Anyways, all of my sources are here to see if you take the time to look.

51	S428a8bea-Aba4c7b80	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single Sex Schools Are Better for Education.	"I will first refute some points and then move on to my positive case. ""Go to any parent, including your own and ask them, what is it that they want for their child when he or she grows up. Most parents will say that they want to raise successful and good and learned human beings."" ""This statement assumes single-sex schools are the best choice for education"" What I would like to point out is that, no where have I implied or assumed or even suggested that single sex schools are better for education in these two lines and no where have I talked about jobs hiring only one sex. They were just for introduction and getting my argument in the flow. When Dragonrule029 talks about homosexuality and how it will cause the same level of distraction as it will in co - education schools and students will be distracted no matter where they are, well this view is completely wrong. Why? Well, because not all students are homosexual and there is a 1% chance that one or two students will be and so how will this make other students distracted, the ones who are not involved and the ones who do not care? In co-ed schools everyone would be looking at each other and the level of distraction in these schools is incomparable to single sex schools and to homosexual students. And what are the chances that there are not homosexuals in co-ed schools? Boys and girls are interested in each other and define themselves by it as stated by Dragonrule029 but they could try for the football team or for the musical for a million other reasons not just because they are interested. They could also be doing it to impress someone or get the attention or to even become friends with someone, which proves my point correct which stated that students have different driving factors in co-ed schools and they deviate from their true paths just because the other sex is present. Even I agree that ""Not everything that is done in schools is meant to ""show-off"" but is certainly influenced by the other sex and even that depends on how much interested they are or how much they like and want to impress each other which is not a good learning environment for them. Moving on to my positive case. My line of argument in this round is how both sexes are different and develop at different rates and thus need to be taught separately. Physically it is obvious we develop at different rates but so do our minds and thinking processes and decision making skills which need to be polished to prepare us for life. Firstly, I'll talk about girls. Simple statement: They are better off in single sex schools. Women in particular benefit from a single-sex education; research shows that they participate more in class, develop much higher self-esteem, score higher in aptitude tests, are more likely to choose ""male"" disciplines such as science in college, and are more successful in their careers. In the USA Who""s Who, graduates of women""s colleges outnumber all other women; there are only approximately 50 women""s colleges left in the States today. Both sexes are in dire need of the proper attention and this can only come if you are in a single sex school and with no distraction and hindrances. This is coming from someone who goes to an all boys school. If boys and girls are taught separately and the curriculum and teaching was tailored to their needs, drop-out rates would not be so high. Co-educational schools attempt to establish uniformity in the teaching of two groups, boys and girls, who typically learn and develop at different speeds and using different methods. Since both have different growth rates, these needs to be catered to and handled with care and attention which is not possible in a co-ed school where every student of both sexes need attention. As a result some aspects of a student may not developed and cause hindrances in their life and make them lag behind the others."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	See96be74-Ace8b4021	2	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex Ed.	"I would first like to thank my opponent for presenting this debate. I will provide some arguments of my own which favor comprehensive sexual education in schools, and then attempt to rebut my opponent's round 1 posting. I would also like to ask my opponent to address arguments in separate paragraphs, and if possible in a numbered fashion (as below), to help the debate go more smoothly. Good luck! 1. Puberty occurs during middle school and high school years, and guidance is required. Common knowledge about human biology informs us that children begin to experience their first sexual urges around age 12, or upon entering middle school. Unchecked hormones, as well as the fact that it has become socially acceptable to begin dating in middle school, make it necessary to inform children of the myriad dangers of sexual activity. Looking back into human history, we are actually breeding later and later, and much of that is both sex education being in place in schools and a morality shift, which is transmitted by both parents and school curriculum. Females are ready to bear children after their first menstruation, which generally occurs anywhere from 6th to 8th grade, and males are able to inseminate even early than that, at times. We've slowly progressed from marriage at 12 to marriage at 25, but moral standards does not change human biology. Students will continue to go through puberty and will continue to grapple with sexual urges whether we choose to ignore the issue or not. Hence, schools have a responsibility to teach sexual education. A school's main functions are socialization and information. Schools teach children not only essential subjects, but also how to be viable members of adult communities. Now, even if you don't agree that sex education is an essential subject (which I do), you must agree that schools serve this dual capacity. A major part of viable functionality in the adult world is sex and procreation. Therefore, it would seem to be in the natural way of it for a school to educate students about realities that they will face. Again, covering up something that will undeniably affect a student's life hardly seems beneficial to their thriving. I challenge my opponent to prove otherwise. 2. Education is an empirically successful way to improve health. I will use two very illustrative examples to prove how little abstinence-only education works to improve the quality of life around the world. My first example stems from right here in the United States. Some of you may have heard of the scandal of Rockdale County, Georgia, in which over 200 students were discovered to be engaged in a community sex ring, ages 13 to 18. How were they discovered? Due to an outbreak of syphilis amongst the ring. Rockdale County schools refused to include sex education in their curriculum, and parents turned a blissfully blind eye to their childrens' behaviors, or assumed that their moralizing was successfully keeping their children away from sex. Unfortunately, biology beat out Rockdale, and the county chose to revamp their sex ed. program. Upon hearing about this, thousands of school districts did the same. Under-education leads to risky and dangerous behavior. We see this in drug abuse, smoking, and alcohol, as well. Does my opponent oppose the D.A.R.E program, as well? My second example is far more illustrative and of world-wide concern. Currently, countries in Africa are being consumed by the AIDs virus. Some countries, like Botswana, can claim that ï¿½ of their adult population is infected with the virus. Over half of those victims are women, most likely involved in prostitution, which is the number 1 cause of the spread of AIDs in sub-Saharan Africa. This continent is also the most under-educated when it comes to sexual safety. Prostitutes and their customers are not encouraged to wear condoms, nor do they all know the dangers of the disease due to a completely inadequate educational system. The link between education and safety is clear: teach children to fear and respect the act of sex, and they will remain far safer than allowing them to live in ignorance. If children in Africa knew about the AIDs virus, then as they grow older, they probably would choose not to engage in risky sexual behaviors. In response to my opponent: ""I am against sex ed. in schools cause I see no use for it...if someone wants to learn more on sex ed. let that be some class outside of school....mostly everyone in school is under 18 and there to learn about the typical subjects and not about sex"" The use for sexual education is outlined in both of my arguments. In a first world nation like the US, sex education is a necessity to curb incredibly strong hormonal responses and to prevent the spread of disease. I believe that 1 in 4 Americans have at least one STI at this point in time. Teaching students about those STI's will statistically limit their transmission, as well as teaching them about safe ways to engage in sex (such as barrier contraceptives). And, while sex ed. may not be ""typical,"" I argue that it is essential. "".......if you teach them about sex they will take it as teachers telling them there old enough for it....just like drivers ed. When kids took drivers ed they knew that they was old enough to drive. Same thing with sex ed. It seems to be fine with calling Anyone under 18 a minor yet we want to ram sex down there through while there still in school! Jr High students are not adults!...High school student are not adults!...its one way or the other you eather lower the adult age or take sex ed. out........"" 1. Age is an arbitrary standard by which to measure adulthood. Age also does not correlate well with biological development at all. While we call an adult 18 years old, a person's hormones start telling them to have sex at about age 12. The 6 years in between must be accounted for somehow. Ignoring those 6 years will only lead to more Rockdale County incidents. 2. Sexual education doesn't encourage kids to have sex. In fact, it does exactly the opposite, by revealing the dangers of sexual activity to students when it matters the most: puberty. They are less likely to be able to interpret or control sexual urges at that stage, since it is a period of immense biological adjustment. I also fail to see the connection between driver's ed. and sex ed. Driving is not encouraged by a biological hormone shift. We don't have the hormonal urge to drive… ""and by the way.....putting condom machines in the schools is basically telling the student (go ahead..have sex) whats the point?? are they going to put more sex items in school in the future?...Oh no there not trying to encourage anything..its just there in case its needed....(ya right)......"" Even though I agree with the placement of condom machines in high schools, I think that it is out of the scope of this debate. The placement of a condom machine is separate from a sexual education curriculum, which is what your topic clearly limits the debate to. ""and the parents who are for this sex ed. i think is brainwashed. and ya wander why kids are in a rush to have sex?...they think there adults....and the kids that are still virgins are being seeing as immature by other students AND adults."" While I must agree that the pressure to have sex prior to leaving for college is high, that is only more reason for sexual education to exist. Sex education validates those who choose to wait, and it supports their decision. Have you actually designed or been taught a comprehensive sexual education curriculum? As a certified, highly qualified teacher with a Bachelor's degree in Education, I can honestly and confidently say that, unless the curriculum was designed by someone highly underqualified, it will not contain any sort of sexual encouragement. In fact, it supports the idea that teenagers are too young to have sex. As my opponent cannot link sex ed. to any of his harms, vote Pro."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	Saff75a5f-Ae38d6245	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Coeducational schools are better than single-sex ones	Hello, thank you for your opinion. I am very glad that the single-sex school has given you a lot. Personally, I went to a mixed school, and I can also say, without a shadow of a doubt, that I benefited a lot from education there. I agree that boys and girls have different needs, but that does not mean that in a mixed school there is no possibility to study what you like or there is no attention to your needs. I could also study what I like. I did not feel uncomfortable or bad at math or physics. In mixed classes there is an individual approach to everyone, according to personal preferences and abilities. Still, I believe that children come to school not only for knowledge, they learn to live in a large team, to establish contact with adults and peers - both girls and boys. This is the social role of the school, which should expand the capabilities of the individual, but education in single-sex schools narrows and impoverishes them. It's just that when you interact with boys every day, you work in a team, then you get used to and get a good experience. Boys are always happy to help girls, and vice versa, and this brings up good qualities in a person. Co-ed schools can not prevent a student from choosing the subject he wants. If the child has motivation and desire, he will study what he likes. There are no worthy studies that would show that education in single-sex schools improves the results of schoolchildren, but there is evidence that gender division strengthens gender stereotypes and legitimizes sexism at the institutional level. When boys and girls study together, of course, they are faced with differences in characters, but, personally for me, this is not a flaw. Not all girls are careful and diligent, as well as not all boys are naturally flippant, hyperactive, slovenly and prone to rivalry. So children of both sexes just learn to co-exist together. I find coeducational schools a very happy, gentle, inclusive place, because I have only good memories about study there: the atmosphere on our lessons was respectful and friendly, I got a really well-rounded education, now I feel very confident working with boys, my school helped me to be very open and communicative person.

51	S63354fc2-Ae5763a6a	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Gay Marriage	"Once again I hope this debate remains civil because I know this is an emotional topic. Instead of directly rebutting your argument, I want to lay mine out first. There exists no such thing as ""same-sex"" marriage. Although marriage licenses are being issued by some state governments to homosexual couples, there are in reality no homosexual marriages""never were, are not now, never will be. Marriage is an institution ordained by God in Genesis: ""For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh,"" and reaffirmed by Jesus in Matthew 19:4-6. All societies throughout recorded history have publicly recognized the institution of marriage as a sexually complementary public institution. The government's obligation is merely to recognize legally what marriage actually is. The government has no business creating an entirely new and destructive institution and then attaching to it the name of marriage. What is Marriage? Marriage is a ""socially approved intercourse between a woman and a man, conceived both as a personal relationship and as an institution, primarily such that any children resulting from the union are""and are understood by the society to be""emotionally, morally, practically, and legally affiliated with both of the parents."" ---David Blankenhorn (homosexual activist). Marriage is not solely or centrally about love. It is centrally concerned with children and their connection to their biological parents. The state has no interest or investment in whether couples love each other. If marriage were solely or even centrally about love and had no connection to children, the state would have no interest in or business being involved with marriage. * Adopted children are not being raised by their biological parents and yet society recognizes those families, so why not legally recognize families led by homosexuals? Adoption historically understood, was not the ideal context for children, but rather a benevolent way for society to accommodate the failures or tragedies in life that leave some children without the nurturance of their biological families. We as a society should not sanction the deliberate creation of children who will not be raised by either their mothers or fathers and same-sex adoption always denies children at least a mother or father. How is that a good thing? * Society allows marriages for couples who are infertile or who choose to remain childless, so why not permit homosexual marriages that cannot produce children? The government sanctions the type of relationship that has the capacity to produce children. The government is not interested in compelling procreation, but rather in supporting the type of relationship that procreates. What are the current requirements for government-sanctioned marriage? Except in the states in which activist judges have overruled the will of the people, the current requirements for government-approved marriages include the following: "" Numbers of partners""marriage is limited to two partners, therefore no polygamous marriages. "" Consanguinity""partners cannot be closely related by blood, therefore no incestuous marriages. "" Minimum age""partners must be of major age, therefore no pedophiliac marriages. "" Sexual complementarity""partners must be of opposite sexes, therefore no homosexual marriages. What are the justifications for these requirements or criteria? Society has concluded that the requirements regarding numbers of partners, consanguinity, minimum age, and sexual complementarity best serve the needs of children and therefore best serve the needs of society. Why is the state involved in sanctioning marriage? The state is involved in marriage for two inter-related reasons: 1. The state wants to encourage, support, and sustain that institution which best serves the needs of children. 2. The state is concerned about what institution best serves the needs of children because that which best serves the needs of children, best serves the needs of a healthy society. Is access to marriage a civil right? No, access to marriage is not a civil right. Our civil rights are very specific rights that are accorded to individuals because of their status as humans. These rights are based on universal characteristics, not on feelings, desires, ""orientations,"" or volitional conduct. Our civil rights are the following: freedom of religion; freedom of speech; freedom of press; freedom of assembly; the right to vote; the right to life; right to have fire arms; freedom from involuntary servitude; the right to equality in public places; the right to due process of law; the right to equal protection under the law. Marriage is an institution, not a civil right. The government can legitimately define an institution and limit its membership in accordance with that definition. Do current marital requirements violate civil rights? Current marital requirements do not violate civil rights. Every individual who fulfills the requirements or conditions that society has deemed essential to the institution of marriage has equal access to marriage. What homosexuals are actually demanding is that they be permitted to redefine marriage""to eliminate one of the conditions that society views as central to marriage: sexual complementarity. Similarly, polyamorous people who love more than one person cannot redefine marriage by eliminating the criterion of numbers of partners. And incestuous couples cannot redefine marriage by eliminating the criterion regarding close blood kinship. And those who believe they are in love with minors cannot eliminate the criterion of minimum age. None of these groups of people are being denied their civil rights even though they cannot get married. They are being prevented from unilaterally redefining marriage which is a public institution that affects the civic good. Is the sexual complementarity requirement equivalent to anti-miscegenation laws (i.e. Are laws that ban ""same-sex marriage"" equivalent to laws that banned interracial marriage?) Laws that permit only heterosexual marriages are not equivalent to laws that banned interracial marriage because ""sexual orientation"" is not equivalent to race. Laws banning interracial marriages were based on the erroneous belief that whites and blacks are by nature different, when, in fact, whites and blacks are not by nature different. Laws that permit only heterosexual marriages are based on the true belief that men and women are by nature different. Therefore, it is not only permissible, but essential that laws that regulate marriage take into account the very real differences between men and women. Thomas Sowell explains that ""The argument that current marriage laws ""discriminate"" against homosexuals confuses discrimination against people with making distinctions among different kinds of behavior. All laws distinguish among different kinds of behavior."" A black man who wants to marry a white woman is seeking to do the same action that a white man who wants to marry a white woman seeks to do. A law that prohibits an interracial marriage is wrong because it is based on who the person is, not on what he seeks to do. But, if a man wants to marry a man, he is seeking to do an entirely different action from that which a man who wants to marry a woman seeks to do. A law that prohibits homosexual marriage is legitimate because it is based not on who the person is but rather on what he seeks to do. Any man may engage in the act of marrying a woman (if she is of age and not closely related by blood). I have one more part I wanted to cover but I'm running low on space so I'll stop here.

51	S134d95c0-Ade94a5be	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	smart devices class affect	"As my opponent is con, I shall be arguing that smart devices will be affecting the learning of students. before we begin, I would like to offer the following definitions. 1. smart devices. the Collins dictionary defines smart devices as: An electronic device generally connected to other devices or networks via different protocols such as Bluetooth-NFC-WiFi-3G-etc. that can operate to some extent interactively and autonomously. 2. affect. the Cambridge English Dictionary defines affect as: to have an influence on someone or something Contention one, smart device interactivity can facilitate learning. (1) For the past 5 years, the 22-year teaching veteran Ken Halla has worked to transition his ninth-grade World History and AP Government classrooms into a mobile device-friendly environment where students can incorporate the latest technology into the learning process. Along the way, he realized that Not only does it help students better organize their assignments, but it's also effective in causing students t do their homework. the Remind101 app has been used by halla to engage the parents of his students. In response to the increased homework levels, he says ""I was stunned by how many more kids started doing the homework,"" he says. ""I just thought they didn""t want to do the work, but it was more that they were unorganized and had forgotten to do it."" Smart devices also allow teachers to quickly and efficiently interact with their student's and test their knowledge at any time of the day. Halla recommends the app Polleverywhere which allows teachers to text out a question typically in A, B, C, D, or E format. the student's then text in their answers and the information is compiled and shared with the teacher. This would allow teachers a much-needed insight into the learning curve of their students. This allows for a more personalized approach to education and as a result, higher test scores. furthermore, many classrooms that shun technology in the classroom make the error of assuming that fun has to come at the cost of productivity. It is, however, possible to allow fun to foster productivity. For example, teachers have noted that when you allow students to listen to music while they work, the noise level goes down and productivity goes up. I will close my first contention with one last quote from Dr.Halla ""I""ve always been that type of person who likes to adapt and change as time goes on, Otherwise, I wouldn""t still be teaching this many years down the road."" source for contention one: http://www.nea.org... (the National Education Association) Contention two If it's not managed correctly, technology can affect learning negatively. (2) If left unchecked, smart technology can run amok in a classroom decreasing productivity. without proper Network restrictions, student's could spend the entireity of their classroom time on twitter or other social media sites. Taking attention away from the instructor and putting it on the internet. Classroom teachers are using technology in the classroom more frequently than ever before. According to the National School Boards Association, students who are exposed to a high volume of technology perform as well as expected on standardized tests, however, technology can potentially do students a disservice if used inappropriately. When teaching using technology, instructors must be aware of the potential hindrances technology can bring to the learning process. Some negative effects of technology in today's classroom are that it can take away valuable learning time, it can be overused, and it can also turn educational experiences into games for students. Here are some of the ways technology can negatively affect education. 1. it can take away from learning time. If the teachers or students are inexperienced with working with technology, time can easily be wasted with technical issues and while it is important to educate these children in technology, it must be done at a pace that meets every individual's needs or more learning time will be wasted. 2. Game mentality. many students associate computers with game playing. unless this is carefully regulated and played to the teacher's advantage, students will easily become distracted and off-task. as you can see it's nearly impossible to argue that technology will not affect student learning. If used properly, technology can be a wonderful benefit fostering the proliferation of knowledge and making efficient use of available time. If used improperly however, technology can be a horrible detriment, wasting time and distracting students. source for Contention two http://classroom.synonym.com..."

Many would object to this stance, as it is a sensitive and touchy subject best left to the parents. I agree, schools should not have to teach students about sex, but the fact is a vast majority of parents won't discuss that subject with their children, and the children won't ask their parents about that subject.

Every debate I have started on this topic spiraled into nowhere because my opponent has yet to help me understand why discrimination and oppression is a good thing!

I have a strong urge to put a stop to bullying in any form. Apparently in this case.. The bully wins! BTW I want my opponent to do research as if he was pro gay marriage. No really. Use the same resources you used to find statistics on homosexual adoption, child human trafficking (aka foster care) and countries that allow gay marriage.

Single-sex schools	Thank you for creating this debate, I look forward to my opponents arguments.I will be arguing that Co-Ed schooling is equal to if not better than Uni-sex schooling.Clarification:Its been agreed by Pro and Con in the comments that we are arguing about whether or not It should be mandatory for schools to offer ONLY Uni-Sex Education up until Highschool.Rebbutals:Easy ReservedPro argued that schools offering only single sex education would cut down on the hastle for their Constructors, For example where in a Co-Ed with 800 students, You would need 2 locker rooms for both Sexes, however in a Uni-Sex school with 800 students you would need 1 locker room since there is only 1 Sex. Which would benefit constructors. However this is not the case, Pro stated in the comments that only students up to highschool should be in a Single-sex school. This would mean that the 800 Students would have to move to a larger Co-Ed School which would mean more construction for constructors. If for example you have a large Co-Ed school you do not need to switch ever. therefor minimizing the uneeded amount of construction. Prevention of insultsPro argued that with sex segregation we'd have no more gender opression, however gender oppression is not a big problem in schools nowadays, despite the fact that little boys think girls have cooties, and little girls think boys are gross( which they still do now D: ) Since pro has brought up insults, I will make a point about bullying. And studies have shown that Single-Sex schools have a bigger problem with bullying Royal Society.Org states the following: More boys in single-sex schools than boys in co-ed schools were likely to have been punched, kicked, threatened, pushed, shoved or touched in a way they did not like. Girls in single-sex schools were more likely than girls in co-ed schools to have experienced exclusion from friendship and been ignored.http://www.royalsociety.org.nz...;http://www.tes.co.uk...Physical bullying is worst in female-only classrooms, with the problem getting worse as children get older, according to the study. More girls and boys taught in a single-sex environment reported abuse from other pupils compared to the 90 per cent of pupils who attend co-educational schools. Contentions:Freedom of ChoiceWe Should have the freedom of choice to decide whats best for our children, There should never be only 1 way to do things, this is a very narrow minded way of thinking and not democratic at all. The education system should not just cater to Boys and Girls being seperated for unnatural reasons.Segregating Genders is UnnaturalIn the real world, Females and Males work together, so why shouldn't it be the same for education? seperating Males from Females would give them an unreal perception of how things are in the real world and thus making them more socially withdrawn and less co-operative when they are put in a situation where they are needed to work with the opposite sex. Putting Boys and girls into school with eachother at an early age, helps them develop in a way that is natural and healthy for their enviroment.

51	Sdd985bd6-Ae5035db8	1	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	U.S. schools should teach comprehensive, sex-positive sex education instead of abstinence	I would love to have a friendly debate with someone on this issue. This is an issue, because currently, [1]-37 states require that sex education include abstinence, with 26 of those requiring that abstinence be stressed as the ideal.-Only 13 states require that sex education be medically accurate.-Eight states require that it be culturally appropriate and unbiased.-Only two states have laws against sex education promoting religion.-24 states' curriculums do not include contraception or condom use.-Only eight states have LGBT-inclusive curriculums. Out of the remaining states, three teach LGBT-negative information.-21 states skip information about avoiding sexual coercion, 22 avoid discussions about healthy-decision making, and 30 avoid discussing family communication.What do I believe should be ideally taught?An inclusive, positive curriculum that gives young people accurate information about how their bodies work; how to have sex safely, pleasurably, and consensually; or how to prevent pregnancy. Here's why this is needed:1) Many young people engage in sexual risk behaviors that can result in unintended health outcomes. For example, among U.S. high school students surveyed in 2011, 47.4% had ever had sexual intercourse. 39.8% did not use a condom the last time they had sex.What does this result in? An estimated 8,300 young people aged 13–24 years in the 40 states reporting to CDC had HIV infection in 2009, and early half of the 19 million new STDs each year are among young people aged 15–24 years. [2]With proper sex education, these infections could be safely prevented, or at least the rate will be significantly reduced, resulting in better sexual health.2) 76.7% of teens did not use birth control pills or Depo-Provera to prevent pregnancy the last time they had sex. In addition, more than half a million unplanned pregnancies occur to teens each year. This has unfortunate effects on the children and parents. Children born to adolescents face particular challenges—they are more likely to have poorer educational, behavioral, and health outcomes throughout their lives, compared with children born to older parents. Both mothers and fathers who have an unplanned birth report less happiness and more conflict in their relationship than those in similar men and women with a planned birth. [3]Surprisingly (or not), teenage pregnancy rates are highest in states with abstinence-only education! The reason is simple: they have less access to accurate information about making sexual choices. Teenagers are already having sex in sizable numbers (see point 1), and according to a 2007 federal report, abstinence-only programs had “no impacts on rates of sexual abstinence.”What we can conclude is that we can't control whether teenagers have sex, but we can control whether they are safe about it and know how to prevent STD's and unwanted pregnancies.~~~Can anyone refute this?

51	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind. This kind of sacrifice makes us heroic; This kind of sacrifice is nee"	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S471f6ceb-Ab64777b5	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single sex schools	No, I didn't attend any single school. I have weighed the opportunity cost of one and the other, coming to decide which one prepares me better for the real world. You have been insisting that the female school has helped YOU achieve more than you could in co educational schools. However, the world is not all bout you, all about the females. We are both women, we both know that females mature earlier than males. In fact boys and girls are a good influence on each other, engendering good behaviour and maturity – particularly as teenage girls usually exhibit greater responsibility than boys of the same age. We can actually help the males! :D Academic competition between the sexes is a spur to better performance at school. You are exactly right that we go to school to learn, not to interact with the opposite sex. In the coeducational schools, I have competed with males student, learned their logical thinking process and influenced to be better in maths and science. I didn't date any of the males when I was in college. If the individual has strong self control, then he/she would not be distracted by the opposite sex. We live and learn, if we are not open to the new things, to the rest of the world, we will be left behind. At some point in our lives males and females need to learn to work together. It's good preparation for the real world! In real world, it is not about just one gender. Even if you obtained higher academic achievement in your previous single sex school, that is not the only thing society measures you at. Co educational schools give both male and female students an opportunity to see how the other works under stress, offer more practical studies such as engineering courses and larger variety of computer technology courses. Again, it's useful experience for the real world. Merry Christmas to your family as well! I am sure you have lovely kids just like youself.:) Okay , but I will also tell you that there are brother schools to the school I went. There are 3 all boy schools in my area . They also have college prep classes and the turnabout for colleges in all these schools is 99%. I know many males that have attended these schools , performed extremely well and went on to college. My uncle is one of them and him and I are only a few years apart. He went to college and got his bachelors in science. He didn't need females to perform well in school. How you do in school doesn't depend on who is the classes you attend , but your own drive and motivation, your teachers , the quality of the education you receive , and often if their are distractions. Single sex schools do not hurt a student in any way. You do not need to go to school with one sex or another to get a good education. The boys and girls schools in my area , give out so many scholarships because they have alumnae that have gone on to graduate from Harvard , Boston College, Boston University , and many other colleges. They have alumnae that are doctors , lawyers, nurses, computer programmers, architects, and many other professions that donate money to their alma mater. How did they perform so well if it hurts to go to a single sex school. Why do you need anyone of the opposite sex in your school to perform well? You don't. If you think that going to a single sex school will cause you to not be able to compete with males in the workforce you are mistaken ... because you are taught in these single sex schools that you can do anything you want to do. You are not afraid in anyway of competing with the males. Nor are the males afraid of competing with females. Also maybe you yourself were not distracted by the males but again as you pointed out that is you personally. I think the best thing for any student is to attend a school that is the environment that is best for them as an individual. I do not agree with you , from my own personal experience or from studies I have read that anyone needs the opposite sex in the classroom to perform exceptionally. My sister and I both went to all girls schools, and my uncle to an all boys school and we all performed better than my brother who went to a co-ed school as well as my cousins.

THBT sex education must be taught in High School students in the Philippines	"a pleasant day to you mr. or ms. jemual. 1. i still believe that sex education should not be taught in High School students in the Philippines. you have said in you 1st argument or clash with my argument about 33% of people engaging in premarital sex result to unwanted pregnancy and even abortion. you may have gotten me wrongly, i have stated that virginity is dignity in the sense that when one is not taking sex education and does not know certain ways to prevent unwanted results one will not undergo sex and will not risk virginity or his/her future. it is all about abstinence. also i would like to ask a question based from that fact; are you sure that those 33% are not taking sex education or not taking precautions (since some precautions are not 100% sure to prevent unwanted results) and what is the age bracket of the majority of that 33%? with what you say that Filipinos have the right to choose whether to engage in sex or not is absolutely true but as i was saying Filipinos hold a strong tradition for virginity and tradition can not be easily swayed just because of sexual urges and also as reflected in my past argument, that sex education isn't only available in school, and i believe that school is not really an appropriate place to learn about sex even if it is in school that you meet whoever you get engaged with. it becomes an embarrassment to students especially Filipinos since they are conservative and probably even the liberated ones maybe uneasy since majority of the class is already uncomfortable. 2. yes, teenagers become curious in what sex will feel like but sex education in school is not the only way to reach to teens about sex. parents are more appropriate bridge in teaching sex education not some stranger that gets in and talk about it and one may be too uncomfortable to ask questions to a total stranger about intimate things such as sex. also exploring does not always mean that you do it, exploring can be attained through reading materials and personal experiences of other people. again i am going to ask you, did you ever get curious about sex? and if yes (which is probably the answer because you opened the topic) did you ever engage in sex? 3. exactly, they already have subjects such as Anatomy or Health and in these subjects precautions already explained and the necessity for a separate subject like sex education is not needed since these two subjects already fill up the requirement or needs. also isn't Anatomy a more scientific approach in opening up the mind of students about their reproductive system? sex education as a subject is more laid back and therefore not entirely scientific as you have said. 4. knowing from another person (teacher) or from a textbook will not boost a person into facing the harsh realities of the world. on-hand experiences is still the best way. you may say that ""if this is so then they will engage in sex and be unprotected since they do not know what to do before doing it."" this is partly correct, since they may engage in sex but they will not be totally unprotected since they can learn what to do through some other institutions or from persons who are experienced and they can talk to freely without feeling hesitant in asking questions (like our parents) meaning i still stand that school is inappropriate for students to learn sex. one must be fully armed before entering a war, they may be many ways to be armed but there are only few which will be effective. 5. i know that sex education will not tackle complex topics but we know that this complex topics are sometimes the most important thing one should learn and if sex education will not teach it then the necessity rate for sex education to be implemented in schools will drop. as i have said earlier i believe that sex education should not be taught in High School students in the Philippines since High School students or the assurance that one is in high school puts one in the position that makes one fit to learn about sex is not true. one may be a high school student but not mature enough to accept whatever one teaches in sex-ed then all efforts to teach about sex and its complications are wasted. i end this round with me still believing that sex education should not be taught in High School students in the Philippines. please forgive (again) any errors i may have done in my speech. i may not be able to reply to your argument as fast as i have done know since this is not my computer and there is an activity i am going to attend in school. i am really sorry if you have to wait for a full 2 days. thank you."

51	S4a973dfd-A883a1238	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single sex education system is better than a co-ed system.	"I'll start off, as I always do when this is the case, with the disclaimer that this is not my actual belief. I am debating this because I like the challenge, and the arguments are not an accurate reflection of my actual beliefs.In this debate, I will be proving that Resolved: Single Sex Education System is Better Than a Co-ed System.Definitions:In order to properly assess the resolution, certain definitions must be recognized. First, we must define better, as we are arguing over which of the two options are better in the round.Better: Greater in excellence or higher in quality[1]Next, in order to ensure we're all clear on what we're arguing over, we must define the different levels of education in the debate.Coed: Of or relating to an education system in which both men and women attend the same institution or classes; coeducational [2]Single-Sex Education: the practice of conducting education where male and female students attend separate classes or in separate buildings or schools[3]I believe that educational systems are commonly known, and unless one of the two debators have conflict in the future over the topic, there is no need to define it.Contention 1: Co-ed education provides unneeded distractions.One of the arguments that comes to the front of the Coed Vs. Singe Sex education debate is that Coed education provides for too many distractions in school. This problem exists in all age groups. Whether it's in early education institutions like elemntary schools where the students think that boys/girls are gross, or when students are in high school and hormones are raging. These distractions lead to less attention on schoolwork or student participation in classes as students of one sex are trying to impress or date students of the opposite sex, especially with males. [4] This lack of attention would then lead to lower grades and less information learned and retained by students, thus undermining th entire educational system. Likewise, those that are intimidated by the opposite sex rather than try to impress them would be intimidated and so would not be able to properly focus on their schoolwork, or to properly socialize in the school environment. [5] These distractions in a coed environment serve to impact academics, and undermine the educational system as a whole. Therefore, a coed academic enviorment would be of lower quality than a single-sex academic environment, and so it would be considered ""better"".Contention 2: Single-sex students perform better than coed students.On average, Students in a single-sex academic environment perfom better than those in a coed academic environment. Although both sexes benefit as a whole, women receive an overall higher benefit from single-sex education. Research shows that they are more active in in class, develop higher self-esteem, score higher on aptitude tests, are more likely to choose stereotypically male-dominated careers, and do better in their careers after college. [6]Furthermore, studies performed in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, New York, Canada, and Ireland show that both boys and girls begin to thrive when the distractions and social pressures provided in coed classrooms are removed by seperating the sexes, and there are marked decreases in discipline problems [7].Contention 3: Coed Schools are counter-productive to the students' needsNot only are Single-Sex academic institutions better for students, but Coed academic institutions actually hinder the needs of students, particularly to the male population. According to a study on the matter, ""When young boys arrive at school today they enter a world dominated by women teachers and administrators as the percentage of male teachers in the nation's public schools is at the lowest level in 40 years. The girls around them read faster, control their emotions better, and are more comfortable with today's educational emphasis on cooperative study and expressing feelings. Boys favor visual processing and do not have the hand-motor control that girls readily achieve in early grades. There's hardly any of the physical action, competition, or structure boys so often crave. And they'd rather do just about anything than express their feelings. For these and other reasons, boys have trouble paying attention in class. They often ignore instructions and generate sloppy work. They are three to four times more likely to suffer from developmental disorders, and twice as likely as girls to be classified as learning-disabled. Many are punished for physical outbursts, controlled and medicated simply for behaving like boys (1 in 5 Caucasian boys spends time on Ritalin). They may not even be allowed to run during recess. This means that boys often get off to a bad start, fail to catch up, and often develop an aversion to school."" [7] Furthermore, a department of education study shows that boys in a coed environment are 50% more likely to repeat a grade, and drop out of schools a third more often than girls [7].Because Coed schools provide harmful distractions, Single-Sex students perform better than Coed students, and Coed schools are counter productive to the needs of students, I respectfully urge a pro vote.Works Cited:1.) http://www.thefreedictionary.com...2.) http://www.thefreedictionary.com...3.) http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com...4.) http://www.newyorkschools.com...5.) http://www.universitylanguage.com...6.) http://debatepedia.idebate.org...7.) http://www.csmonitor.com...(page)/2"	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S7fa4a031-A60b521e9	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	The use of cell phones by students should be encourage	"I rebut against my opponent argument. According to him or her statement ,he or she stated that ""we are advancing in technology"" In modern traditional days we communicate through drums but this days we use phone to communicate which make us lazy and dependant on machines ,we go to farm with combine harvester,tractors etc this decrease the skills of our knowledge. To proceed to my argument the Classroom , Technology, Mobile Phone In modern classrooms, instructors face many challenges as they compete for students' attention among a variety of communication stimuli. Rapid growth of mobile computing, including smart phones and tablets, presents a double-edged problem: along with previously unimaginable access to information come previously unforeseen distractions. Of wide concern to many instructors is the potential distraction caused by students using their mobile devices to text, play games, check Facebook, tweet, or engage in other activities available to them in a rapidly evolving digital terrain. That concern has potential merit; recent statistics from the Pew Foundation show that the median number of daily texts for older teens rose from 60 in 2009 to 100 in 2011 (Lenhart, 2012 ). Moreover, 64% of teens who own cell phones have texted during class, even in schools where cell phones are technically banned (Lenhart, Ling, Campbell, & Purcell, 2010 ). Those texts potentially come at the expense of learning, as texting during class reduces students' ability to self-regulate and give sustained attention to classroom tasks (Wei, Wang, & Klausner, 2012 ). Cell phones, and the broader array of digital mobile devices, pose unique communication challenges for both users and those with whom they interact. Some critics argue that texting and other digital communication behavior potentially diminish key social skills like effective listening. As one commentator noted, ""We think of phones as a communication tool, but the truth is they may be just the opposite"" (Skenazy, 2009 , np). Other views suggest that people are adapting to new communication norms in an increasingly digital world, learning to quickly attend to, process, and respond to multiple and sometimes simultaneous messages (Davidson, 2011 ). Given the many possible ways that digital communication tools will continue to influence practices of teaching and learning (Schuck & Aubusson, 2010 ), instructional communication scholars should enact programmatic research to understand how these tools impact classroom communication and subsequent learning outcomes. The present study builds on past research by examining whether texting or posting to a social network site has negative impacts on students' note-taking behaviors and subsequent performance on exams. To resolve my argument,cell phones brings about Disrespect : Cell phones are so small these days and using them surreptitiously that detecting their use is difficult. The issues of cyber-bullying, sexting, and other forms of serious misconduct are increasingly common and easier to conceal with cell phone technology. Cell phones in the hands of problem students just make the problems harder to discern and harder to handle. Some argue that the teen angst common in that age group is exacerbated with cell phone use: everything from gossip to sexuality becomes a bigger issue when cell phones are involved."

51	S6bece754-Aefe6bfe5	2	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Comprehensive Sex Education	"IntroductionAbstinence-Only education (AO) teaches adolescents to abstain from sexual activity, and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). AO programs teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to live; that sexual expression outside of marriage will have harmful social, psychological, and physical consequences; it usually omits controversial topics such as abortion, masturbation, and sexual orientation; and AO uses fear tactics (such as highlighting condom failure rate) to encourage the limitation of sexual expression. I will be arguing that schools should teach about birth control alongside sex, as opposed to limiting the discussion to ""don't have sex before marriage."" Rosalie will be arguing that comprehensive sex education should not be taught in schools. Do schools have the right to teach about sex? Should they? Most schools concentrate sexuality education in grades 7 through 9 and confine the unit to the health or science curriculum [1]. This is because sexuality directly links to both subjects. Comprehensive Sex Ed (CSE) does not teach about the morality of sexuality, but rather about factual things that pertain to sex. Schools are not discouraged from teaching fact-based information. For example schools teach about different religions, even though public schools are not allowed to promote one religion over another. Similarly, schools can teach about both sex and abstinence without necessarily promoting one ideal over the other. Consider the fact that schools also teach about politics without necessarily promoting one ideology over another. In other words, it's possible to teach about sex without encouraging students TO have sex. The conversation/curriculum would strictly be educational and informative. In the United States, 46% of all high school age students, and 62% of high school seniors, have had sexual intercourse [2]. Therefore we can effectively assume that 1/2 of all HS aged kids are having sex. Teaching CSE provides information that directly relates to the lives, health and safety of sexually active teens, as well as prepares the other half so they will be better equipped to understand the consequences and options. Since the schools would not be promoting sex but merely teaching about it, they have every right to promote factual information that pertains to health and science. Sex in and of itself is not a taboo subject but merely part of nature. It is the individual or cultural (religious) preferences that dictate particular attitudes toward sex, but schools are not responsible for accommodating the bias or personal beliefs of some. Rather schools exist to foster learning and provide a useful, well-rounded education. Learning about sex is very useful - more about that later. What if parents think the topic is inappropriate?It's common for schools to teach about reproductive health (specially menstruation) when students become adolescents, prior to reaching puberty. If parents prefer their children not learn this material, they have every right to deny the school permission for this lesson. The child can either be kept home, or more realistically be relieved from the class and not be exposed to things their parent or guardian does not feel comfortable with. Notes explaining the content material are often sent home for the parents to understand before making the decision. However just because some parents prefer their kids remain ignorant and afraid, doesn't mean that's the option many parents would choose. Thus schools should teach CSE and allow the parents who disagree to make other arrangements. The fact is there is a lot of scientific and useful health information about sex, thus schools have a reason to include it in the curriculum overall. After all we should assume schools are secular and therefore non-moral, fact-based information is relevant in class. What are the harms of Abstinence-Only sex education?AO programs do not acknowledge teen sexual behavior. They believe that sex outside of marriage is immoral. Consequently, these programs do not teach young people how to protect themselves when they become sexually active. Contraception and condoms may be mentioned only when discussing failure rates. As a result, young people who engage in sex will not be knowledgeable enough to understand why they are important or how to use them effectively. This puts sexually active young people at great risk. With AO, the consequences of STDs, guilt, and shame are used to frighten young people into abstinence. However statistics show that AO does not work at inhibiting sexual activity. Research shows that AO is ineffective at preventing both unwanted pregnancy and the spread of STIs, among other shortfalls [3]. In addition, AO has been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially life-saving information about sexual risk reduction [4].According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, ""scientific evidence simply does not support an abstinence-only-until-marriage approach."" A 2010 report by the Guttmacher Institute pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens reversed their decline in 2006, near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United States [3]. In other words, AO promoted pregnancy because teens were ignorant about birth control. Furthermore teaching AO did not actually prevent teens from exploring sex. Teens are having sex whether parents want to accept it or not. As a result of AO education, they are completely unprepared and do not understand the risks, options or preventative measures that could protect them. Why should schools teach Comprehensive Sex education? CSE includes age-appropriate, medically accurate information on a broad set of topics related to sexuality including human development, relationships, decision making, abstinence, contraception and disease prevention [5]. It is a more holistic approach that recognizes abstinence as one possible approach to sex, but prepares students for a more realistic one. The majority of Americans do not stay virgins until marriage. Even assuming one stays abstinent until marriage, they can still benefit immensely from learning about sex. First, CSE not only teaches about sex with others, but provides insight about one's own sexuality as well. For example CSE touches on masturbating and other things that have to do with the changing body. It might also touch on homosexuality and other sexual identities for informational value. Many teens have a lot of questions about their newfound sexual preferences and desires. While AO programs keep kids in the dark (many parents are too uncomfortable or ill equipped to have these conversations), CSE looks to provide insight that could benefit an adolescent's understanding of themselves and their bodies. CSE reduces risky behavior. In November 2007, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy released an authoritative and comprehensive review of research findings on the effectiveness of CSE programs. They found that none of the comprehensive programs hastened the initiation of sex or increased the frequency of sex. It also found that CSE worked for both genders, for all major ethnic groups, for sexually inexperienced and experienced teens, in different settings, and in different communities [6]. In short, CSE is helpful and effective across all youth populations. Conclusion Since many teens are having sex, it would make sense to assume that parents and society want them to be safe. Inhibiting STIs and unwanted pregnancy are important. Teens have a right to learn important information that directly affects them. They should be knowledgeable about their choices and the possible consequences, as well as how to protect themselves. This would leave them in a position to make more informed decisions. AO programs increase the risk of unwanted pregnancy and STIs. Research indicates they are completely ineffective at preventing teen sex. Therefore they only keep people ignorant and ill-prepared to make smart and healthy choices. On the other hand, CSE educates and protects teens. It explains (often tough or awkward) information to teens about themselves, their bodies and their options in a way that is informative and valuable. There is a ton of value in sex education that is relevant to health and science. One's mental health could also be affected. Uncomfortable parents can make other arrangements if they prefer to keep their children ignorant, afraid and exposed to potential danger. Otherwise, CSE provides a learning environment where adolescents can be exposed to information they might not even realize they needed to know, and that can teach them things they might want to ask their parents questions about later. Again CSE is not about the morality of sex, but the science of it. == Back to Con.

51	S9e12aef1-Af4148ba1	1	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Should teachers teach about non-straight sex	"I believe that, teachers should teach about non-straight sex because of safety, self image and respect. Firstly let's go into safety. I've heard lots of stories about people getting injured and STDs from unsafe straight sex. In non-straight sex there are a lot more to worry about, so people have to deal with these problems more often. Also in non-straight sex there are more misconceptions because people don't have figures clearing these things up. Secondly is self-image. Lots of young LGBT people that I've talked to, have problems with their self-image and accepting themselves. All of that is heightened when they don""t know what to do, when they want to explore their body's or have non-straight intercourse. Lastly respect. We can't get rid of disrespect but we can move it form sexuality. I say this with proof from myself. I used to have homophobic tendencies and when I wanted to insult somebody that's what I would go to. Homophobia comes from two places mainly, religion and not understanding; so we can help one of them at least."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S63354fc2-A6e5a8d5c	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Gay Marriage	"It appears my opponent has forfeited this round. I don't know why but I hope everything is alright. Anyway, here's my rebuttal to my opponent's argument. 1. Adoption: The scientific fact is that children's health is endangered if they are adopted into households in which the adults""as a direct consequence of their homosexual behavior""experience dramatically higher risks of domestic violence, mental illness, substance abuse, life-threatening disease, and premature death by up to 20 years. ""The probability of violence occurring in a gay couple is mathematically double the probability of that in a heterosexual couple,"" write the editors of the National Gay & Lesbian Domestic Violence Network newsletter. The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that ""people with same-sex sexual behavior are at greater risk for psychiatric disorders""""including bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, and anxiety disorders, major depression, and substance abuse. The Medical Institute of Sexual Health reports: ""Homosexual men are at significantly increased risk of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, anal cancer, gonorrhea and gastrointestinal infections as a result of their sexual practices. Women who have sex with women are at significantly increased risk of bacterial vaginosis, breast cancer and ovarian cancer than are heterosexual women."" (Executive Summary, ""Health Implications Associated with Homosexuality,"" 1999.) The Institute reports that ""significantly higher percentages of homosexual men and women abuse drugs, alcohol and tobacco than do heterosexuals."" Oxford University's International Journal of Epidemiology reports: ""Life expectancy at age 20 years for gay and bisexual men is 8 to 20 years less than for all men. ... Nearly half of gay and bisexual men currently aged 20 years will not reach their 65th birthday."" Is it healthy for children to be adopted by adults whose lifestyle is characterized by promiscuity and the medical hazards of multiple sex partners? A homosexual news magazine columnist in Detroit last month [February 2002] wrote regarding his partner: ""This is his first relationship, so he has not yet been ruined by all the heartache, lies, deceit, and game-playing that are the hallmark of gay relationships. ... A study I once read suggested that nine out of 10 gay men cheat on their lovers"" [emphasis added]. The Centers for Disease Control warns that men who have sex with men ""have large numbers of anonymous partners, which can result in rapid, extensive transmission of sexually transmitted diseases."" This isn't all of the information so if anyone is interested, they can continue reading here: http://science.jburroughs.org... 2. Progression: Is it progressive to destroy a pillar that society itself is built upon? I do agree that one's image is important but one's image shouldn't come at the expense of pushing for something that will harm society in a major way. Once again, homosexuals are not denied the institution of marriage. The reason they do not want to follow the rules of the institution is because the rules do not suit their homosexual behavior. This is not a civil rights issue, but a behavioral issue. 3. Authority: Why is the state involved in sanctioning marriage? The state is involved in marriage for two inter-related reasons: 1. The state wants to encourage, support, and sustain that institution which best serves the needs of children. 2. The state is concerned about what institution best serves the needs of children because that which best serves the needs of children, best serves the needs of a healthy society. Is access to marriage a civil right? No, access to marriage is not a civil right. Our civil rights are very specific rights that are accorded to individuals because of their status as humans. These rights are based on universal characteristics, not on feelings, desires, ""orientations,"" or volitional conduct. Our civil rights are the following: freedom of religion; freedom of speech; freedom of press; freedom of assembly; the right to vote; the right to life; right to have fire arms; freedom from involuntary servitude; the right to equality in public places; the right to due process of law; the right to equal protection under the law. Marriage is an institution, not a civil right. The government can legitimately define an institution and limit its membership in accordance with that definition. Do current marital requirements violate civil rights? Current marital requirements do not violate civil rights. Every individual who fulfills the requirements or conditions that society has deemed essential to the institution of marriage has equal access to marriage. What homosexuals are actually demanding is that they be permitted to redefine marriage""to eliminate one of the conditions that society views as central to marriage: sexual complementarity. Similarly, polyamorous people who love more than one person cannot redefine marriage by eliminating the criterion of numbers of partners. And incestuous couples cannot redefine marriage by eliminating the criterion regarding close blood kinship. And those who believe they are in love with minors cannot eliminate the criterion of minimum age. None of these groups of people are being denied their civil rights even though they cannot get married. They are being prevented from unilaterally redefining marriage which is a public institution that affects the civic good. 4. Sanctity of Marriage: Throughout history marriage has always been viewed as the joining of men and women. Why? Because society benefits when men and women get together and bring forth off-spring. Since homosexual unions never have that option, their unions cannot be called or seen as marriage. It is fair to give equal things equal value but it is unfair to give two unequal things the same value while calling them the same....in this case, equating unprofitable homosexual unions with profitable heterosexual unions. 5. Empathy: We can be empathetic towards something, but that doesn't necessarily mean that what we are empathetic towards is correct for us or society as a whole. 6. Economical: Although same-sex unions will pour money into the economy, the effects will not last. Just look at the places where same-sex marriage has been issued for more than a decade. Those place are still not doing to good financially. If homosexuals make up 2% of the American population, how is their money going to help stimulate the economy? Also, why not encourage more heterosexuals to get married if marriage money is going to help the economy? Heterosexuals make up a much more larger part of the population. 7. Freedom of Religion: Same sex unions will stiffen freedom of religion. All one must do is do an internet search of the cases brought against religious people and their businesses on behalf of homosexuals in places where same-sex marriage has been legalized. In ever place where same-sex marriage is the law of the land, any religion that teaches against such thing is automatically deemed wrong, not because that religion has been proven wrong, simply because the law now says so. Also, no government or culture is philosophically/religion neutral. That means someone's world views are going to win the government and culture and if the homosexual view wins, religious freedom that doesn't agree with the homosexual agenda automatically takes a back seat and in a way that is using the law and not debate to silence the opposition. You are now wrong simply because the law says so? No debate(s) regarding the matter? How is that fair in a so called free republic? Thank you."

51	Sf27da082-A442fab1b	2	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Parents, not schools, should teach their children about sex.	Given that cultural and social attitudes towards sex are so variable, it should be up to the family to decide how to broach this sensitive topic. Schools are supposed to give students the skills and knowledge they need for employment and/or higher education: sex education is a separate, much more personal, issue. Telling students to abstain ensures that no one is taught anything more than their parents want, and leaves room for parents to give a more extensive education if they so desire. This is especially true since most parents support abstinence education anyway: A Zogby International poll of U.S. parents found that 78% of parents think sex education classes in public schools should place more emphasis on promoting abstinence than on condom and other contraceptive use.[1] [1] Zogby International. “Survey of Nationwide Parents of Children Age 10-16.” Zobgy International. 27 March 2007.

51	S38169e6-Ad786cb30	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Girls and Boys Should Attend Different Schools	Girls and Boys Should Attend Different SchoolsGood Afternoon, Ladies and gentlemen, I define this topic as schools to be mainly high schools, because this is the situation now. This topic is not about the past, but the present. When I say schools, I mean we are not differentiating between public and private because it does not state so in the topic. Lastly, when I say schools we are leaving out selective schools because it is guaranteed that those schools are already the best, because they are made up of especially chosen students.Girls and boys should attend different schools because single sex schools excel. We argue that attending single sex schools are necessary for our academic and physical well being. Single sex schools are vital to our lifestyle. Co-ed schools give a standard education whilst single sex schools bring out the best in each student. In other words, they excel.In this round I will be arguing the academic side of the topic and in my second round I will be arguing for the physical side of why boys and girls should attend different schools.And now, to begin my case - Girls and boys have different learning styles. A single sex school can cater for their gender's suited learning styles. For example, girls often work better in groups and through listening/acoustics whereas boys tend to learn better independently and would rather just do an activity on the subject. To extent - boys would work better on a project than a listening to a lecture, and girls, well, they will learn better the other way round - they would learn better through a lecture than working on a project. In a co-educational school, staffs have to cater for both styles of learning. If a class does a project, the girls won't learn as much. If a class is given a lecture, the boys won't learn as much. Even if a class does a project one week and a lecture the next, the students are still not learning to their max. Only single sex schools can help achieve this goal. Single sex schools excel.Secondly, girls and boys are born naturally better at certain subjects. For example, girls are born better at English whilst boys are born better at Mathematics. If a girls school were to add a few extra minutes to a mathematics lesson per week they could end up as equal as boys. The same goes for boys, if a boys school were to add a few extra minutes onto an English lesson once a week they’d become equal with the girls in English. Of courser, students are still required to study at home, in their own time, to be the best they can be, but a few extra minutes for one lesson a week will give an equal ground for both genders to start off. In a co educational school, they could attempt this approach but will not succeed. The school would have to add a few minutes in both English and Mathematical lessons and will just be teaching boys and girls the same amount in each subject. This method can only be used in single sex schools, and must be used for fairness in education between girls and boys.Lastly, girls and boys are a distraction to each other during class. Boys are always trying to impress girls with dumb jokes and girls always trying to impress the boys. This causes major distractions in the classroom. For example, during geography, some girls are passing notes when a popular boy sees them. The girls act like nothing happened because they are trying to impress the boy. This is an interruption to important and valuable time, dedicated to learning. The actual scenario may have only been a few seconds but the people in their surroundings will of noticed and will continue to turn their head to check on the girls, to see what they are up to. This is just one example, of one class, of one year! Each time the distraction becomes more frustrating. This problem can’t occur in a single sex school because the other gender is not there to cause distractions. Another scenario that might happen in the classroom is that a few boys make a joke but some of the girls roll their eyes. Because boys want to impress the girls, they try to do something cool. What they do not realise is that this is also distracting, and like the first scenario, other people surrounding will notice and continue to look at them for the rest of class. Their attention will only be focused their surroundings, not the task at hand. Single sex schools excel.Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys should attend different schools simply because they excel. They can use a certain learning style(s). The schools can afford to add a few extra minutes a week to a certain class. Single sex schools provide a better education, bring the best out of students and thrive. They are a place free from the other gender’s distractions in classes. The quality education provided by a single sex school is impossible to acquire in a co educational school. Girls and boys can live in the same world, but they need to be separated whilst learning. Single sex schools are essential to a child’s life, if they want a great education, not a standard co education, but a quality, advanced education.

51	S63354fc2-A211e8e0e	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Gay Marriage	"Conclusion: Before I begin let me say that I'm sure that the vast majority of homosexuals are not horrible people and that is not what this debate is about. Homosexuals are not being denied the institution of marriage. The problem is that the institution doesn't approve of homosexual behavior and just because an institution will not tolerate your behavior doesn't mean you're outright being denied access to said institution and it's benefits. The institution is not saying that people who experience homosexual desires cannot get married at all. The institution is simply saying that there is a criteria that must be followed because this criteria is what benefits all of society. Answering Objections: Executive Summary 1. Don""t put discrimination in the Constitution! a. Too late""it""s already there. In fact, all laws discriminate! But it""s discrimination against behaviors not persons; and it""s with cause, not arbitrary. For example: i. The First Amendment discriminates against Muslims establishing a religion (a behavior), but it does not discriminate against Muslims as persons. ii. The 13th Amendment discriminates against businessmen taking slaves (a behavior), but not businessmen as persons. b. Likewise, our marriage laws discriminate against the behaviors of homosexuals, polygamists, bigamists, adulterers, and the incestuous among us, but they do not discriminate against them as persons. c. Laws must protect citizens from harmful behaviors regardless of why people commit those behaviors. 2. But homosexuals are a minority class like blacks. a. Homosexuals are not a class of people, and neither are heterosexuals. We are males and females, not homosexuals or heterosexuals. Why classify people by sexual desires? b. You will find many former homosexuals. You will never find a former African-American. c. Committing homosexual acts is not the same as skin color or gender. Homosexual behavior is harmful; skin color or gender is not. And sexual behavior is always chosen (even if the desires are not). d. This issue is not about discriminating against people but against the potentially harmful behaviors of people. And all laws discriminate against behavior (see #1 above) 3. But homosexuals were born that way! a. The source of homosexual desires has not been determined. But even if there is a genetic component (although one wonders how it is passed on), those desires do not excuse behavior. b. An orientation toward homosexuality doesn't make the behavior morally right anymore than an orientation toward violence makes gay bashing morally right. c. We were all born with an orientation toward bad behavior. And desires, whatever their source, do not excuse behavior. Should adults act on every desire they have? Of course not. In fact, the principled restraint of destructive desires is called CIVILIZATION! 4. Weren""t you born a heterosexual? a. No, I was born a male. b. My sexual behavior is chosen just like yours. 5. Opposing same-sex marriage is like opposing inter-racial marriage! a. No, ethnicity is irrelevant to coupling; gender is essential. (There""s only one race-- the human race-- but there are two genders.) b. Opposition to interracial (inter-ethnic) marriage is without merit. Men and women are designed for one another, so interethnic couplings are helpful. But homosexual couplings go against the natural design and are therefore harmful. 6. What about equal rights? a. Homosexuals already have them. Everyone has the same right to form relationships, but no one has a right to have their relationships endorsed by the state. b. Everyone has the same right to marry the opposite sex; homosexuals don""t like their choices and thus want special rights. c. If we grant special rights for homosexuals, on what grounds can we deny special rights for consenting adults who desire other socially destructive or unhealthy relationships such as polygamy or incest? 7. It's unfair discrimination to prevent same-sex marriage. a. No one is being treated unfairly because everyone is playing by the same rules: we all have the same right to marry the opposite sex. b. It is not unfair to define who does and doesn't qualify as a spouse. When the state refuses to recognize a marriage between a father and daughter, it is not discriminating unfairly. It is wisely protecting society by choosing not to sanction an unhealthy and socially destructive relationship. For the same reasons the state should not recognize homosexual relationships. c. Marriage, by design, is between an unrelated man and woman. The state should simply recognize the natural design of marriage; it should not re-define marriage. 8. It""s bigotry to prevent same-sex marriage! a. No, it""s sound judgment based on the evidence that same-sex marriage would be harmful, while traditional marriage is healthy and helpful. b. This argument, like others, presupposes a moral standard. (Homosexual activists acknowledge that bigotry violates the Moral Law"" why don""t they admit the same with regard to homosexual behavior?) 9. Why allow traditional marriage but prevent same-sex marriage? a. Because traditional marriage is our national immune system. It protects us from disease and social costs. When our marriages are strong, our society is strong. When our marriages are weak, we all suffer. b. Traditional marriage: i. Improves health and lengthens the life span of the man and the woman. ii. Protects women from uncommitted men. iii. Lowers welfare costs to society. iv. Lowers the crime rate (marriage civilizes men and focuses them on productive pursuits). v. Procreates and encourages an adequate replacement birth rate c. Children from traditional marriage homes are: i. Seven times less likely to live in poverty ii. Six times less likely to commit suicide iii. Less than half as likely to commit crime iv. Less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock v. Healthier physically and emotionally when they reach adulthood vi. Do better academically and socially d. Children from fatherless homes account for: i. 60% of America's rapists ii. 63% of America""s youth suicides iii. 70% of America""s long-term prison inmates iv. 70% of America""s reform school attendees v. 71% of America""s teenage pregnancies vi. 71% of America""s high school dropouts vii. 72% of America""s adolescent murderers viii. 85% of America""s youth prisoners ix. 85% of America""s youth with behavioral disorders x. 90% of America""s runaways e. Same-sex marriage would not benefit, but hurt traditional marriage and society. 10. How could allowing same-sex marriage possibly hurt marriage and society? There is no neutrality on moral issues. By legalizing same-sex marriage, the state would be approving of them and therefore encouraging them. Laws help change attitudes and encourage good (or bad) behavior. In other words, the law is a great teacher. Many people believe that whatever is legal is moral, and whatever is illegal is immoral. Same-sex marriage will: a. Trivialize the importance of marriage, leading to increased Illegitimacy and social costs. i. Elevating homosexual unions to the level of heterosexual marriage would further downgrade the perceived importance of marriage in our culture. Marriage will be seen as just about coupling rather than procreation. ii. This is the case in Norway where same-sex marriage has been in place since the early nineties. Illegitimacy is exploding partly because people no longer connect marriage to childbearing (see # 14 below). iii. Illegitimacy hurts everyone via increased crime and social welfare costs (not to mention the direct harm to children who are denied either a Mom or a Dad). b. Lead to higher medical and health insurance costs. i. We would likely see an increase in homosexual behavior following the endorsement of same-sex marriage like we saw a sharp rise in abortion following Roe v. Wade. ii. There's more (6 more points I wanted to make and point 10 is not finished) but I'm pressed for space so I'll stop here."	CON	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	Scdafbd9b-A4e9cf9a3	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	THW Make Gym Class Mandatory Throughout High School.	"In this round I will both outline my points and refute my opponents. I was not able to state my points in the last round because, unfortunately, my computer broke down. I am not using this as an excuse, because frankly, as truthful as it is, it's a bad reason. I'm just justifying why I am merging Round 2 and round 3 into one ""essay"". That said, I'd like to start out with a quote from the Berkeley Daily Planet. The purpose of high school, is to prepare students for a meaningful life in the 21st century; to be a good citizen, economically self-sufficient..."", said Terry Doran, School Board president in an article on the Berkeley Daily Planet. I agree that this is the purpose of high school, but disagree that mandating physical education for four years in order to graduate is the right approach to this. Not only does mandating physical education NOT provide to the goal of high schools, it also is severely detrimental to Schools and students in general. Argument 1: It is detrimental to schools and students. School funding in Canada is decided by the province as of today, and this funding is solely dependent on the taxes collected by the providential government. Taxes in Canada are collected as a percentage of income, and so the funding for schools isn't fixed as for the entire country. What this means is that schools in areas with a higher economic status recieve higher funding. Schools like these may not be seriously affected by the new bill, but other schools. with less funding will be. Incorporating a physical education class into the curriculum comes with a serious cost, both monetary and support-related. Mandating a physical education class means that every high school is now mandated to construct a gym-if they don't already have one, to purchase equipment for the class (whether this means basketballs and gymnastic mats, or CPR dummies for the health portion of it), to hire enough teachers to teach all of this, and to hold school board meeting to decide on the curriculum for this class. All of this requires a significant amount of money, which some schools don't have. Mandating schools that are tight on funding to obey this law means that money will now be taken away from Math classes, Science classes, or after school activities. With the money that would be saved by NOT mandating FOUR years of physical education, schools could provide more AP classes, or more after school activities which would offer more to students that four years of learning how to shower properly. To a student that is interested in entering a career in health or gym, benefits from this, but a student interested in the medical field, for example, does not benefit from the funding being directed away from the classes he/she requires. In this way, neither the school nor the students benefit from this law. Argument Two: It will cause rifts between students. Canada is a place of wide ethnic diversity, and with wide ethnic diversity comes diverse opinions. Many parents don't want their students in Sexual Education because of their moral beliefs or simply, their culture. If these credits are required for graduation, suddenly this becomes an issue. Will these missed credits be excused? Whether they do or not, an issue of whether or not the required credits are actually required comes into question. Issues of what should and should not be required in the curriculum will assail the school board. A high school is no place for this type of controversy. To take this a step further, students with disorders(like ASD-holes in the walls of your heart, over-fatigue disorder-makes you extremely fatigued with just an insignificant amount of exercise, blindness, etc) are inhibited from participating in some or all of the activities in gym classes, or maybe even not be able to participate properly. This will lead to rifts between students, and depression in students (according to the Medline Plus's page on depression causes). It also causes bullying and hazing in high schools. According to usnews.com, 47% of reported bullying incidents were sports/phy-ed related. Argument Three: Four years of Physical education classes in High schools is unnecessary. Until today, Physical education is required in Canadian school until 9th grade. The need for mandating 4 MORE years of physical education is unnecessary. 56.3% of students already participate in sports out of school, on average, and a majority of kids already know how to properly take care of them by 9th grade. Not only is four years of physical education, highly unnecessary, it also harms schools by exposing schools to lawsuits. For these Reasons, four years of physical education is highly unnecessary and just a waste of a school's resources and time. Not to mention, an idea that will expose schools to unneeded controversies. For these reasons I urge a CON ballot. Now, to address my opponent's points. My opponenet brought up obesity rates as his first contention. These statistics are true, but physical education is not the way to go. As Mary Strain stated perfectly in the Scholastic Magazine article about the Disadvantages of Physical education, ""Many kids take part in P.E. only because it's a requirement and there is no choice. Being forced to participate -- especially in sports children don't prefer or may not feel able to perform -- makes the experience a drudgery and may actually make them less likely to exercise outside the school setting. Some educators advise that schools allow students some choice in P.E. activities to avoid making exercise seem like a hated necessity, rather than healthy and fun. Absent this choice, P.E. may actually have the opposite effect than the one the school intended."". As she stated, physical education classes aren't the way to solve obesity issues. With more and more students taking classes online, relevant to this debate, physical education, the benefits of physical education such as lowering obesity aren't always existent. Also, There are no issues today with the workforce being too obese to do certain jobs, and none of them were ever forced to take 4 years of physical education, and so there is no evidence that the problems will suddenly emerge now. And as per your third sub-point regarding diabetes and other obesity related diseases, like i stated previously, physical education classes will not help. And as per tax increasing, mandating physical education in ALL schools, like i stated in my first point, will only serve to increase taxes even further. Then, for your second contention, teaching sex Education doesn't have a fixed success rate. For example, Slovakia has the 4th highest teen pregnancy rate at 26.9% according to http://www.nationmaster.com.... They however, are mandated to teach sex Ed in high school. Taking another approach, India has one of the lower teen pregnancy rates in the world at a mere 7.1%. Here however, Sex Education is not mandatory. South Korea has the lowest teen pregnancy rate in the world at 2.9%, but they don't have a fixed policy on Sex Education. Thus, Sex Education merely provides some knowledge on the workings of sexual interactions, but doesn't prove to effectively counter high birth rates. There is no reason to enforce a law unless it is proven that it benefits the public, and that these benefits outweigh the damages. I have shown through my rebuttle that these ""benefits"" that my opponent suggested would be effects of mandating physical education, aren't sure to happen. I have shown you the damages that mandating FOUR years of physical education in schools will yield. These tentative benefits that , yes, will work in only specific utopian societies and aren't proven to work everywhere, so not outweigh the damages that i mentioned. There is no reason to spend billions of dollars that we don't Have under the current economy, on a program that might not yield the benefits it claims to. VOTE CON."

51	Sf0770da-A760eca8e	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexual Marriage and Lifestyle: Detrimental and Not Necessarily About Equality.	"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"

51	S215be912-A5b15a199	2	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Why sex education should be taught in grade schools.	"Sex education should be taught in grade schools to students. Puberty begins at the age of twelve for females and thirteen for males. Puberty is a time of confusion, questioning, and self-examination, along with emotional and physical change. Alot of children and teens are uncomfortable talking to their parents about sexual behaviors and questions and are left feeling helpless. Sex education in grade schools allows a child to be able to freely express themselves emotionally, ask questions, gain answers, and be comfortable aroung peers who are experiencing the same difficult change. The only thing different about sex education is that it is NOT a ""how-to"" class; it will NOT teach students how to have, perform, and enjoy sex, nor will it teach a child how to properly use contraceptives. The class (program) is used to teach children about the difference in which their bodies is going through as well as teach them the bodily form, such as organs and etc. It is better to have a child be taught about sex and the body by a mature and responsible teacher, rather than from the media."

I was on the honor roll all 4 years at a college level, as was the majority of my school. If your grades were not kept up, you were asked to leave. There were girls in my school that were extremely good at all different subjects. I do not believe you need to go to school with the opposite sex to perform well. You are not at school to interact with the opposite sex , you are in school to learn. Here are some numbers I found on the subject ""In a twenty-year Australian study of 270,000 students, Dr. Ken Rowe found that both boys and girls performed between 15 and 22 percentile points higher on standardized tests when they went to separate schools."" ""A 2001 British study of 2954 high schools and 979 primary schools showed that while boys at the lowest ends academically improved the most in single sex schools, nearly every girl regardless of her ability or socio-economic status performed better in single sex classrooms than co-ed ones. The study concluded that single sex education was particularly beneficial to girls. Highest achieving students in this study were girls in single sex schools followed by co-ed girls, then boys in single sex schools and finally co-ed boys. The study noted that every one of the top fifty elementary schools and top twenty high schools in Britain are single sex"" ""In all-girls schools, girls take over all the positions of leadership in the school whether it's drama, sports, yearbook, or debate team. Students are more likely to continue in math and science and athletics. For example, 14% major in math compared to 10% of boys and only 3% of girls in co-ed schools."" I am not saying that Co-Ed is bad , but there are many advantages of single sex schools as well. As I have said I have been to both and I can say that I preferred my all girls high school to the co ed elementary school. In the all Girls school , I was able to concentrate more. I was very relaxed and more confident. I have never been unable to speak to and be comfortable around the opposite sex, if anything I developed a strong sense of who I am , and what I deserve, My self esteem was improved by attending the HS I did. My grades were wonderful and I received a top of the line education. When I went to college, I was at the top of my classes. I actually was bored as I had already read every book they assigned in my english class. I have never settled for less with any bf and I have a wonderful husband. Single sex education never affected me in a positive way. I believe there can be advantages of both co-ed and single sex schools , but to say that kids suffer at a single sex school is incorrect. I do not need men to learn. I am capable of learning in any environment. I think unless you have attended both types of schools , you can't make an accurate assessment on both sides.

51	S71152e3f-Af618df04	2	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex education in schools should be mandatory	In today's scenario, I feel Sex education is Must in Schools. Following are the reasons. 1) Due to the mass media and social networking sites, school going children are exposed and attracted to the stuffs which are ethically not accepted for them at this level. 2) Peer pressure forces the child to be the part of the activities which may be the reason for STD. 3) Unauthentic, incomplete and improper information may lead to serious problems. 4) The loss that includes physical, mental and social factors ultimately directs to the national Loss. In case the sex education is given to the same children, lot many problems will be taken care of - ultimately Prevention is better than Cure. There are some sections of the society where the parents are not that educated that they will guide their children in this regard. On the other hand some parents are well educated and so busy that they are unable to spare time for their children and that too on such topic. So sex education at school level is must.

51	Se69d093e-A8d0e4d2	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexual sex is more harmful than heterosexual sex	"Thanks again to Flametiger200 for this discussion. 1. Pro completely changed what #1 was about. In the last round, I explained that anal sex was prone to injury regardless of who was having it. Thus while gay men engage in anal sex more often, the risk has nothing to do with ""gay sex"" but anal sex which is not synonymous with gay sex despite the correlation. My opponent suggests that there are more gay men than lesbians. That's true but the figure is negligible. Plus, while more men identify as gay, the overwhelming majority of people who identify as bisexual are women. So bisexual women + lesbians have a higher population than gay men [1], and Pro hasn't proven that bisexual women have a lot of STDs (or that lesbians have). 2. Pro argues that condoms are only 70% effective for gay men but 80% effective for heterosexuals. When used properly (which is key!) condoms are actually 98% effective or more [2]. However Pro's source suggesting that condoms are less effective for gay men say that it's because gay men use them inconsistently and improperly [3]. Extend my argument about how ANY unsafe or unprotected sex (including inconsistent or improper use of condoms) is harmful regardless of one's sexuality. 3. My opponent repeats his argument on lesbians with higher rates of BV which ignores the vast majority of my rebuttals from the last round. Extend my argument that BV is not necessarily transmitted through sex, so this contention is completely irrelevant. Extend my argument that this bacteria is practically harmless. Extend my argument that heterosexual women have far more STDs overall (which I sourced in previous rounds). Extend my arguments on how lesbians tend to be less promiscuous which Pro dropped. 4. On his source, Pro writes, ""Copy and paste it on Google and click on the the link that's been cited 242 times."" But in the last round I've explained how this source was used on biased Christian websites that promote ""conversion therapy"" and other voodoo. He does not explain why this research is valid or a responsible sample study. It's 100% inaccurate to say that lesbians have more sex with men than straight women. If that were true (lesbians having sex with men) they would not be lesbians but bisexual. Furthermore, I argued that Pro has to concede that it's easier to spread disease through penises, or drop the point that ""lesbians have more sex with men"" (which hasn't been conclusively proven) because if penises aren't an issue, then this doesn't matter and it's a moot point. But it appears that my opponent concedes and accepts that it's easier to spread STDs through penises than vaginas.My opponent repeats that gay sex is the greatest way to get AIDS. Once again, there is absolutely nothing about gay sex that makes one inherently prone to AIDS. Rather, the transmission of AIDS is highest among gay men because gay men have higher rates of the disease due to unprotected sex. HOWEVER, if gay men (or anyone) was having protected sex -- then one's sexuality would be completely irrelevant. Moreover, Pro failed to respond to the fact that AIDS like many other STDs are curable and treatable which was my #5 point. 5. While more people have died from AIDS than pregnancy, the majority of those who died reside in third world countries like Africa where they have no treatment or resources for sex protection. More importantly, most of these people are born with AIDS that is passed on to them, rather than contracting it sexually [4]. Scientists have virtually found a cure for AIDS, which is the only STD that Pro was able to exemplify was truly dangerous. This is a moot point as the treatment for AIDS is so advanced and a cure will soon be the norm [5]. Extend my arguments that pregnancy and childbirth are more dangerous than STIs. Conclusion I will simply copy and paste my last round's conclusion since it's the same. Science doesn't support the argument that gay sex causes disease. It does support the argument that unsafe sex causes disease. Unsafe sex is not limited or inherently related to one particular sexuality. If you have safe gay sex, you'll be fine. If you have unsafe straight sex, you might not be fine. Both gay and straight people can have the same amount of sex and the same type of sex (anal, oral, etc.). Responsible people will be safe whereas irresponsible people will be endangered. Websites that talk about how to prevent STDs do not say to inhibit gay sex - they say to practice safe sex, regardless of type. Lesbians make up 1/2 the gay population and have safer sex habits (less partners, less possibility of transmission). Numbers show that lesbians have less STDs. Nevertheless, STDs are mostly curable and treatable - including AIDS - whereas pregnancy and childbirth can kill you. More people die from things related to heterosexuality (pregnancy) each year than gay sex.

51	Se69d093e-Aa436aa47	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexual sex is more harmful than heterosexual sex	"1. ""Homosexual men do engage in anal sex more often than heterosexuals. However anal sex among homosexuals is not inherently more dangerous. It is only more dangerous because gay men have higher rates of STDs"" Yes, but STDs is not the only reason as to why gay sex is harmful. Since gay couples tend to have anal sex much more than straight couples they tend to have more anal tears, anal leakage and anal cancer than straight couples, thus being another reason as to why it's more harmful than heterosexual sex. 2. ""STDs can largely be prevented by using protection. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that latex condoms provide an essentially impermeable barrier to particles the size of STD pathogens [1]. They are over 98 percent effective. Ergo, assuming both homosexuals and heterosexuals in controlled environments are having sex (wearing condoms), they will be equally protected against STDs. Condoms do not favor one demographic over the other."" You're right, but you see...the problem there is that the majority of gay men don't use condoms. There was a new survey conduced that found that the overwhelming majority of gay and""bisexual""men didn't use a condom the last time they had anal sex. Over 3,100 men participated in the survey, which asked a variety of questions concerning sex, sexual health and relationships. The study found that 72 percent of respondents said they didn't use condoms the last time they had anal sex. http://www.lgbtqnation.com... Another study was done by CDC researcher Dawn Smith who has found that only 16 percent of men who have sex with men reported consistent condom use during the study period. https://www.queerty.com... ""A 2010 Journal of Sexuality study found that if we were to define ""gay sex"" as non-vaginal sex, specifically oral and anal sex, then anytime two heterosexual people have oral or anal sex (not to mention BDSM or kink or group sex or role playing or masturbation), they are engaging in the very same activities that qualify as gay sex [2]. For instance more than 1/5 women engage in anal sex. Why is a blow job or anal sex inherently more dangerous amongst gays than straights? "" I somewhat agree with this point, but when I say gay sex I usually mean 2 people of the same gender having sex, and when I say straight sex I usually mean 2 people of the opposite gender having sex. I don't define straight and gay sex based on what they do in bed. So when gay couples are having sex THAT is gay sex...when straight couples are having sex THAT'S straight sex. But you see, the problem with gay sex is that gays have no choice but to have either anal or oral. It's dangerous for them because it's the only options they have. That's one of the reasons they have a higher std rate. ""High-risk groups for STDs include anyone who, within the past 10 years, has engaged in intravenous drug use, resided in Haiti or Central Africa, received multiple blood transfusions, or who is a hemophiliac or a regular sex partner of any of these people - not just homosexuals. I would argue there are high risk groups that extend beyond general sexual preference. Gay people who use protection will have INFINITELY less STDs than gay people who do not use protection, thus there are other variables to consider aside from sexuality."" Yes, there are other high risk groups of contacting STDs, but you have to remember that STDs is called SEXUAL transmitted disease for a reason. The most common way to contact STDs is through sex, not intravenous drug use or visiting hati. In fact according to the CDC gay sexual contact is the riskiest way to contact STDs. http://www.cdc.gov... Gay people who use protection will have a lower chance of contacting STDs, but it's too bad that the majority don't use protection. There are other variables, but sex is the most common way (gay sex to be exact). 3. ""Most importantly, lesbians qualify as homosexuals and homosexuals are the (sexuality) demographic with the least amount of STDs."" Gay men also qualify as homosexuals and they're the one's with a higher risk of STDs therefore, homosexuals at still at risk. Consider the fact that 88,000 women in the U.S. were diagnosed with the STD pelvic inflammatory disease"" and out of those cases, 2 were lesbians [4]. In other words, lesbians account for about 0.0022727272727273% of those cases. Just because lesbians have are at a lower risk of pelvic inflammatory disease doesn't really mean that they're more immune to stds. Lesbians are at a higher risk of catching BV than heterosexual women. http://womenshealth.gov... ""It's easier to spread/transmit/insert fluid and other organisms with a penis; a penis penetrates which makes it easier to swap bacteria and viruses. The risk for STDs among lesbians is lower than sex involving a man because less bodily fluids are exchanged between women."" I'm not so sure about that. I'd say that biology tells us it's just as risky to catch stds from a vagina. A penis starts off pretty dry in the beginning, but when women are horny they have TONS of vaginal fluids flowing out, so I'd say it's just as easy to swap bacteria between a man and a woman. Unless the man has been having homosexual sex, then the risk of a man penatrating a women isn't very high. ""The risk for STDs among lesbians is lower than sex involving a man because less bodily fluids are exchanged between women."" I don't think that's true. Especially when women maturbate or even while they're horny or orgasm. According to an American sex guru and co-author of the original G-spot book. At a recent conference, she told said""that in most cases, the amount of fluid secreted is usually around 'half a coffee cupful' for women. http://www.netdoctor.co.uk... That's quite a enough for lesbians to contact Stds. Anyways, the main reason as to why there are less lesbian std reports are due to the fact that the health consequences of lesbianism are less well documented than for male homosexuals. This is partly because the devastation of AIDS has caused male homosexual activity to draw the lion""s share of medical attention. But it is also because there are fewer lesbians than gay men. http://www.encyclopedia.com... So we can't really say whether or not lesbian sex is as harmful until it's studied and looked into more like homosexual and heterosexual sex. 4. ""Another thing to consider about lesbians is that if/when they do use penetration in sex, they might use sex toys instead of a real penis. While a heterosexual man (or woman) with an STD risks transmitting their STD, lesbians can use toys in place of real body parts, and toys don't have STDs."" Actually, lesbians still have a higher rate of stds then heterosexuals, but a lower rate than gay men. The reason for this isn't due to lesbian sex, but it's because, Study after study documents that the overwhelming majority of self-described lesbians have had sex with men. In fact Australian researchers at an STD clinic found that only 7 percent of their lesbian sample had never had sexual contact with a male. Skinner, et al., Abstract; Ferris, et al. p. 581; James Price, et al., p. 90 Consequently, the lesbians"" median number of male partners was TWICE that of exclusively heterosexual women. I'm running out of characters so just copy and paste this on Google, download the pdf and read it below. Katherine Fethers, et al., ""Sexually transmitted infections and risk behaviours in women who have sex with women,""Sexually Transmitted Infections, 76(5): 345-349, p. 348 (2000). Anyways my point is that women who identify as lesbian are actually at a higher risk of contracting STDS then straight women, not because of the lesbian sex but because they tend to surprisingly have more sex with men (heterosexual, bi sexual, gay and drug users) than heterosexual women. So even the average lesbian has a higher risk of transmitting stds than the average heterosexual. 5. ""Heterosexual sex poses the risk of pregnancy. Pregnancy carries with it a plethora of possible health related issues and complications [8]. Gay sex does not yield the possibility of pregnancy or any of the related problems."" Well according to the CDC only 600 women die each year of pregnancy in the U.S http://www.cdc.gov... While there are around 19-20 MILLION new std cases per year and 10s of thousands of people dying from HIV ALONE per year. Imagine the number if we'd combine ALL stds. The chances of you dying from preganacy are so low compared to some STDs. Plus. Having a child has a plus side for most people at least. We can't say the same for Stds. So to me the ""risk"" of getting pregnant beats the risks of homosexual sex."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	Sc9466f76-Ac9adfa8e	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single Sex Education is Better than Co-Education	"Thanks to my opponent for describing the points in such a lucid way.Here are the expansions of my points:(1)Students at co-education schools learn to interact better with the people of opposite gender:Students at co-ed schools meet a variety of people of opposite gender. It is definitely true that children meet many people of opposite gender outside school also. But to understand a gender better one must interact with a variety of people of that gender. Not all students are involved in extracurricular activities. Understanding siblings often backfires in understanding other people of that gender because young children think that all the people of that gender must be like their siblings.Here are some statements made by students studying in single-sex schools about their understanding of the opposite gender:""Boys were exotic creatures for us. We only met them inside the pages of books. In college, where they appeared in human form, we had no idea what to say to them."" [1](2)Co-education provides a platform for students of one gender to compete with those of the other gender:Competition is very essential in honing the skills of a child. Children must compete with the students of the opposite gender to realize where they stand. In some subjects, boys perform better than girls whereas in some other,it's the other way round. If children do not realize this at school level, they will face trouble and lag behind in competitive examinations.(3)Co-education helps in exchange of views and opinions between the students of opposite genders:It is evident that boys and girls see things with different perspectives. The views of boys about literature and poems can not be the same as girls' and girls' views about subjects like mathematics or physics can not be like boys'. Therefore, presence of both boys and girls in class will make the class more interactive and help in exchange of views among the students of opposite gender.(4)The level of understanding and learning by students depends upon efficiency of teacher and not on specialized methods:In some cases it is observed that students at single sex schools perform better than those at co-ed schools. But many other researches have also shown that students at co-ed schools perform better. ""Being with more girls is good for everybody,"" said Prof. Analia Schlosser, an economist from the Eitan Berglas School of Economics at Tel Aviv University. ""We find that both boys and girls do better when there are more girls in the class,"" she added.The study found that boys with more female peers in their classes showed higher enrollment rates in both advanced math and science classes, but overall benefits were found in all grades for both sexes. [2]Therefore, no sole conclusion can be deduced from the researches conducted by various organizations. I would like to add that the academic performance of the students depends upon the way teachers teach in the class and the amount of effort they put to make the class interactive and interesting.(5)Education doesn't mean only academic performance. Involvement of both boys and girls is necessary in many other activities of school life:I believe all will agree that education does not mean only academics. A student, in his/her school life participates in many other extracurricular activities which require participation of students of both the genders. Imagine a school football team without cheerleaders and a prom night with only boys or girls. These things may not seem necessary but are definitely a very important part of a student's school life. Single sex education may improve discipline or improve academic performance, but it makes a student's school life dull as they lack the companionship of the people of the other gender.Sources: [1] http://www.dnaindia.com...[2]http://www.medindia.net...Refutation:(1) Students at single-sex schools perform better than those at co-ed schools: As i have already stated, few researches can not deduce a sole conclusion about the performance of students in single sex or co-ed schools. Many other researches have also shown that students perform and behave better due to the presence of students of other gender in a class.(2) Males and females have different learning styles which must be treated differently:I believe there is no harm in allowing students to choose subjects which they find interesting. We can not force boys to love painting or girls to love computers. It is a thing which they have to decide on their own. In fact, presence of students of both the genders in a class allows them to share their interests, opinions and views about a thing which is not possible in single-sex schools. (3)Single-sex education promotes gender equality:I don't think gender inequality in the professions you mentioned is due to girls not being interested in them. There are many girls who find such professions interesting and choose professions also. But, it is due to the chauvinism of men and our patriarchal society that the women are unable to prove their worth in such professions. In fact, i believe allowing girls to compete with boys and score better than them will make them more confident and provide them motivation to choose professions which are dominated by men.(4) Students have a life outside of class:I agree with your point that some students at single-sex schools have life outside the classroom and are good at interacting with people of the other gender. But, it is not the case with everyone. Many girls and boys at single-sex schools face problems in interacting with people of the other gender confidently. Moreover, siblings do not help in making someone good at interacting with the people of opposite sex as they can not make students understand the whole gender completely. To understand the other gender completely one needs to interact with many persons and experience companionship of various people having different personality traits."

51	S19dd953-A8b7010a5	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single sex schools are good for education	"I believe that single-sex schools are not an ideal environment to teach children in Western society. The fundamental flaw in single-sex education is that its premise is reliant on every child being homogeneous; all boys fit their stereotype and all girls fit theirs. I can say immediately, from personal experience, that this is not true. I am gay and often found it difficult to socialise with other boys when growing up -- all my best friends were girls. If I were to be separated into an all-boy's class, I would have found it difficult to be happy and consequently to learn. Education does not consist of just core subjects and extracurricular activities; schools offer their pupils valuable life skills, which includes socialisation. Single-sex schools limit socialisation by gender and enforce a ""them and us"" mindset. Apart from the obvious disadvantage that this will have on the pupil when they find themselves in the workplace, it may also prove confusing when every other part of society encourages equality. I would much rather children to grow up in an environment with various different kinds of people -- different ethnicities, faiths and indeed gender. Teaching tolerance is just as important as core subjects. But do children learn better when taught without the opposite gender? The research is inconclusive; most research in favour of single-sex schools cite an increase in test scores by female pupils, but the boys seem to be getting the rough end of the deal because their test scores are often said to decrease. Other research claims that both genders perform better when taught together; I found this article thorough and interesting: http://www.greatschools.org..."

51	S5e2fadc8-A30376bd9	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Students from single sex schools fare better than children at mixed sex schools.	"Glad to oblige! Although ""attack"" is reserved for the next round, the nature of my position is that I must attack the proposition, which I will do without any particular response to Pro's opening argument. I am arguing against the proposition that students at same-sex schools fare better than students at mixed-sex schools. There are several fundamental problems with this proposition, as it is usually made. I do not need to establish a positive case that coed schools produce better outcomes than same-sex schools; however, I will offer some reasons why coed schools could produce better outcomes. First, the proposition is universal, while students of a particular gender are likely to vary in their characteristics. For this reason, even experts who study this issue and advocate for single-sex schools qualify their advocacy, stating that single-sex education is not best for every child. [1] One reason for the qualification is that assumptions about the learning styles of girls and boys, even if true, do not hold true for each girl or each boy. [1] It is logical to extrapolate and observe that, in an era of increased understanding of the difference between sex, gender, and orientation, that a perfunctory separation based on sex is unlikely to be positive for each child. Second, the data do not bear out the claim that same-sex schools produce better outcomes. Although some studies have claimed to find evidence of academic advantages associated with singe-sex schooling, subsequent studies have exposed that research as flawed. [2] For instance, the single-sex schools producing better test scores were already selective in admissions, and students who did not do well tended to drop out. When such factors are accounted for, there is no evidence that single-sex schools produce better outcomes. [2] On the other end of the spectrum, studies showing some advantages for at-risk students should not be interpreted to imply broad advantages to students who do not share their characteristics, even though such differences may be ignored by advocates who simply aggregate favorable data. [2, 3] There is a lack of quality studies to support the claim that single-sex schooling has measurable academic advantages. [1] In fact, a broad survey of the literature shows that, for a number of outcomes (both short term and long term, both academic and cultural) the research does not establish that students at single-sex schools fare better. [3] Ultimately, the breadth of curriculum and the quality of the school are better predictors of whether a student will ""fare better."" [4] Third, there is reason to believe that same-sex education does little to rectify the purported disadvantages of coeducation. In fact, some studies have indicated that focusing on sex separation leads to increased stereotyping and eliminates the chance for students of both sexes to learn positive ways of perceiving and interacting under the guidance of adults. [1] Furthermore, claims that same-sex education leads to better self-esteem for girls and enhanced learning for boys have been refuted by current studies. [5] Finally, the claim that girls and boys learn differently is of limited significance, because the main difference in learning styles occurs in adults and may be the result of educational approaches that assume differences based on sex. [1,2] The neurobiology does not support the claim that boys and girls have such different brains or brain development that different educational approaches based on sex are justified or useful. [6] Because the evidence does not establish that same-sex schools produce better outcomes, there is no reason to believe a claim that students who attend a same-sex school will fare better than those who are coeducated. On this demonstration alone, the reader should reject the proposed resolution. However, even if the reader does not agree that the evidence fails to support the resolution, there are some basic reasons why one could expect a coeducated student to fare better. From the beginnings of Western philosophy, thinkers have suspected that integration of the sexes will afford great advantages to society and have asserted that women must learn the same things as men. [7] While that is a societal observation and not about individual advantage, we now live in a sex-integrated society. It is unclear why education is not part of preparation for living in that society or why girls and boys do not need to be aware of each other's learning processes (if they are different, which is in doubt). In fact, it is much more logical to conclude that girls and boys need to understand and integrate with each other in a structured environment where well-trained, conscientious professionals provide appropriate guidance. Ultimately, the evidence does not support the superiority of same-sex schooling, and coeducational schooling could be important for preparing students for a sex-integrated society. The approach should be on to train teachers appropriately so that, whatever a student's (or parent's) choice, the instructor is prepared to help the student ""fare better."" [4] Even if it is trivially the case that some students fare better at a same-sex school, that does not speak to whether this state of affairs is necessary or is, instead, the result of a failure to address prejudices and provide better instruction. In conclusion, the reader should reject the proposed resolution. While some students might fare better at a same sex school, the universal resolution is unlikely to be true and is rejected even by same-sex schooling advocates. The data, furthermore, do not support that the resolution is even true on average. Instead, the initial data generated by advocates of same-sex education was inconclusive, and our current understanding is that such data was flawed. The evidence supports a resolution that single sex schools are no better than mixed sex schools. Finally, because we live in an integrated society, devising educational approaches that reflect that reality and educate children about living in a sex-integrated society is important. In evaluating this kind of resolution, which has policy implications, we should not focus on the trivial question of what might be better for one student today. Instead, we should question whether it makes more sense to focus on factors that have been shown to be more important in educational outcomes, such as proper training of instructors and an adequate breadth of curriculum. I believe it does. Sources: [1] Amy Novotney, Coed versus single-sex ed, American Psychological Association (2011), http://www.apa.org.... [2] Diane F.

51	Scee72b1d-A4ba3f04a	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	Se69d093e-A971691fb	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexual sex is more harmful than heterosexual sex	"1. You've pointed out that out that lesbians are half the population of homosexuals, and thats one of you're problems. According to The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, a sexual orientation law think tank, released a study in April 2011 estimating based on its research that 1.7 percent of American adults identify as gay or lesbian, while another 1.8 percent identify as bisexual. Drawing on information from four recent national and two state-level population-based surveys, the analyses suggest that there are more than 8 million adults in the US who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual, comprising 3.5% of the adult population. Of men, 2.2% identify as gay and an additional 1.4% as bisexual. Of women, 1.1% identify as lesbian and an additional 2.2% as bisexual. http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu... So there are most likely more homosexual men than homosexual women, so if we were to combine homosexuals, gay men are actually the majority compared to lesbians, therefore the ratio of homosexuals having the most anal sex would still be in favor to them. So the ratio wouldn't really be negated. If the ratios were equal then why would heterosexuals still have a lower std and anal disease rate? Ive proven that gay sex is more harmful due to the fact that gay men engage in more anal sex than heterosexuals. Ive proven that both gay sex AND anal sex is harmful. if a gay man has anal sex with ANOTHER MAN he is STILL engaging in gay sex. just because he's having anal with another MAN doesn't mean it isn't gay sex, and since GAY anal SEX is at an incredibly higher risk of danger than heterosexual sex Ive proven that gay sex is more harmful. ""After all, if a gay or lesbian couple never had anal sex, or had it less often than a straight couple, it wouldn't be the gay sex that was harmful, but the frequency of anal sex which is not based on sexuality."" hmmm... well too bad con is speaking hypothetically and not factually, a gay couple who don't have or not having as much anal sex as heterosexual couples is pretty rare, and doesn't apply to most homosexuals. like i said. Anal sex or sex in general IS based on sexuality of the sex, having any type of sex with a man qualifies as gay sex. if a gay man has anal sex with another man they are participating in gay sex, since gay men tend to do it more frequently than heterosexuals my point still stands. gay sex his more harmful than straight sex. 2. ""I pointed out that STIs can largely be prevented by condoms. Pro says that many gay men don't use condoms. Ergo, Pro is arguing that irresponsible sex is dangerous, NOT gay sex."" you're correct the STD rates of homosexuals will go down for homosexuals if the majority of them used condoms. The problem is that condoms are only 70% effective for gay men. http://www.catie.ca... http://www.pridesource.com... while its around 80-90% effective (or higher)for heterosexuals https://www.guttmacher.org... so even if both homosexuals and heterosexuals were to use condoms gay sex would still be riskier than heterosexual sex. therefore my point still stands. ""I've already explained that lesbians do not have high rates of STDs and account for 1/2 of the homosexual population."" I've rebutted con's claim by showing her a study done by the Sydney Sexual Health Centre in Australia that included several doctors and consisted of 1432 WSW who claimed to exclusively only have sex with women or haven't have sex with a man, but rather a woman in the past 12 months. The study also consisted of 1423 WSM women that reported never having sex with a woman. The results of the study were that Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was significantly more common among WSW. Genital herpes and genital warts were common in both groups, although warts were significantly less common in WSW. It also stated that the prevalence of hepatitis C was significantly greater in WSW WSW were more likely to report previous sexual contact with a homo/bisexual man or with an injecting drug user than heterosexual women (which already puts them at a higher risk). Here's the link to the study again. Katherine Fethers, et al., ""Sexually transmitted infections and risk behaviours in women who have sex with women,""Sexually Transmitted Infections, 76(5): 345-349, p. 348 (2000). Copy and paste it on Google and click on the the link that's been cited 242 times. The reason as to why this info and research isn't out there isn't because of scientific research. I've stated it's because of the LACK of scientific research. Lesbians certainly do have a lower rate than gay men, but I wouldn't take that giant leap and say that itd. It's lower than heterosexuals. Lesbians do have sex with gay and Bi sexual men more than heterosexuals. So until the study is taken as seriously as heterosexual and gay STDs we can't say too much about it. Con claims that the main reason gay men have high std rates is because they're not afraid of pregnancy lool. I think that's a little silly. Obviously they can't get pregnant, but I wouldn't say that's the main reason. Con is right about them being more careless about sex, but also fails to mention that The average HIV transmission rate during anal sex is estimated to be 18 times higher than the rate during vaginal intercourse. Homosexuals are in a higher risk of hiv/aids due to the fact that they have GAY anal SEX more than heterosexuals, and gay anal sex is MUCH more riskier and harmful BECAUSE of the high STD rates and anal defects that heterosexuals don't usually face. So my point still stands gay sex is still riskier/more harmful than heterosexual sex. Con continues to claim that lesbians are half of the gay population. It's been rebutted. The CDC won't say it directly (probably due to political correctness) but if we use logic and common sense we can figure out that gay sex (in America at least, and most parts of Europe) is the number 1 transmitter of STDs. HIV/AIDS is a SEXUAL transmitted disease. If HIV/AIDS is transmitted the most through SEX wouldn't it be logical to assume homosexual men transmitt it the most to others due to the fact that their the ones who carry the disease the most? It only makes logical sense to say hiv/aids is transmitted mostly by gay sexual contact the most. I mean....what else could it be? Heterosexuals can't be the ones transmitting it the most Sexually. In fact new cases of HIV from the CDC are from women who have sex with Bi sexual men. http://nypost.com... Gay sex it's self isn't the problem. You are correct. But gay sex is definitely PART of the problem. If unsafe sex was the only problem then homosexuals and heterosexuals would have around the same rate of stds. But that's not the case. Homosexuals still have an INCREDIBLY higher rate, so this should give anyone a clue that gay sex is also part of the problem. A study was done showing that 70% of women didn't use condoms when having sex with men. I said it's too bad, because it would definitely lower the risks of stds between homosexuals, but not as much as heterosexuals. 3. Bacterial infection may not be an STD, and the cause isn't completely understood, but certain activities, such as unprotected sex or frequent douching, increase your risk. http://www.mayoclinic.org... Just because BV can happen to virgins doesn't mean it still can't be pinned on sex. HIV can happen to virgins (incredibly rare) but does that mean HIV can't be pinned on sex? Besides. The virgin can with BV can still have sex and transmit it. 4. 4. Well according to the study that I showed that consisted of thousands of women and many doctors. The majority of lesbians have had more sex with homosexual, Bi sexual, and drug users than heterosexual women. Which puts them at a higher risk of STDs than normal heterosexual women. Unless if con comes up with an even better cited medical source like I've done debunking that study, then I guess my claim is more reliable than cons. I'll cite it one last time. Katherine Fethers, et al., ""Sexually transmitted infections and risk behaviours in women who have sex with women,""Sexually Transmitted Infections, 76(5): 345-349, p. 348 (2000). Second, the studies that show this have been demonstrated to use horrible sampling for their data, and those results have been largely discredited among peer review anyway [2, 3]. Hmm? Con has brought up yet again another logical fallacy. Didn't you even read your links? None of it says that about BV. Or lesbians. it has never been discredited either. In fact. Most of it actually support what I say. Especially you're Oxford link. In my arguments I said lesbian women have a higher chance of getting BV. Your link says. Bacterial vaginosis is common among women in general and even more so among women with female partners. I said that we can't really assume that lesbians have little to no risk of STDs because of the extreme lack of research on this subject. Your link says WSW should not be presumed to be at low or no risk for STIs based on sexual orientation, (which is exactly what con has been doing.) Then later goes on to say Although extensive data are available regarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among men who have sex with men, relatively little has been published about STI prevalence and risks among other sexual and gender minorities, including women who have sex with women (WSW). Health care providers and their female clients would benefit from increased knowledge of STI risks and testing guidance for women who have same-sex partners. I claimed lesbians or WSW were most likely to be Hiv positive due to the fact that they do more Hiv risk behaviors than heterosexual women. Like drug injections, and having sex with gay and Bi sexual men. Your link claims that More common is the potential for WSW to acquire HIV through other modes, including injection drug use and sexual contact with high-risk male partners. And then cites other links like, http://ajph.aphapublications.org... And http://www.tandfonline.com... 5. I'm running out of characters so I'll make this quick. 303,0000 women died of pregnancy last year. 1.2 million people died of hiv/aids in 2014. Hiv/aids is an std, so that counts as an std death. Therefore 1.2 million+ people died of stds. If you're in a developed country the chances of you dying of pregnancy is near 1% if you have hiv/aids you WILL die sooner or later unless you're filthy rich like magic Johnson, unfortunately not very many people are as rich as hum to pay for the expensive medication. Being pregnant has a plus side. Most people are delighted to have children. We can't say the same for stds. Therefore the risk of being pregnant is as bad as the risk of catching a disease. Science doesn't exactly say that gay sex is harmful, but it does say heterosexual sex is safer. It'll be dishonest to say otherwise. I've gone over most of con's conclusion. Since I'm running out of characters I'll end hear. Thank you for the debate con. Vote pro"	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school

Comprehensive Sex Education	Full Resolution: Comprehensive Sex Education Should Be Taught in Public Schools Abstinence-only sex education is a form of sex education that teaches not having sex outside of marriage. It often excludes other types of sexual and reproductive health education, such as birth control and safe sex. Comprehensive sex education, by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence [1]. I will begin my arguments in Round 2. I prefer to debate someone with experience.If you are restricted from accepting this debate but have an interest, let me know!The first round will be for my contender's acceptance. Good luck.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org...	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S8be2b95f-Adab4fbf8	2	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex Education Should Be Taught In Schools	"Thank you for your defense. Here are my opening statements. Typically, in sex education, you learn how to put on a condom, tips on safe sex, the risks of getting infected, and much more, according to the current curriculum. [1] This is definitely necessary when you look at the statistics of STDs and STIs. ""More than half of all people will have an STD/STI at some point in their lifetime....About half of all new STDs/STIs in 2000 occurred among youth ages 15 to 24."" With sexual education, we can reduce the harm and possibly deaths of young people due to sexually transmitted diseases. Thousands die every year from diseases such as AIDS and HIV. ""In the classroom setting, high quality sex education curricula that have been shown to be effective in delaying sex, reducing the frequency of sex or the number of sexual partners, increasing condom and contraceptive use, and reducing the number of STDs in youth are those that not only discuss the dangers of high-risk sexual activity, but also address multiple factors affecting sexual behavior, such as perceived risk (i.e. the personâ€™s belief that he or she is at risk for a STD), social norms (i.e. the attitudes and behaviors around condom use within the personâ€™s social circle), and self-efficacy (i.e. the personâ€™s confidence in their ability to insist on using condoms with their partner)."" As proven before, condoms are made to prevent pregnancy and disease. If used correctly, they work 98% of the time. [6] Obviously, if high quality sexual education is taught, then STDs will go down, particularly in youth. B. Teen Pregnancy ""In 2014, a total of 249,078 babies were born to women aged 15â€""19 years, for a birth rate of 24.2 per 1,000 women in this age group."" Apparently, this is supposed to be the low! Yes, while the rates have gone down, teen pregnancy is still an issue. It affects the teens, the children, and families involved. ""In 2010, teen pregnancy and childbirth accounted for at least $9.4 billion in costs to U.S. taxpayers for increased health care and foster care, increased incarceration rates among children of teen parents, and lost tax revenue because of lower educational attainment and income among teen mothers. ""Pregnancy and birth are significant contributors to high school dropout rates among girls. Only about 50% of teen mothers receive a high school diploma by 22 years of age, whereas approximately 90% of women who do not give birth during adolescence graduate from high school. ""The children of teenage mothers are more likely to have lower school achievement and to drop out of high school, have more health problems, be incarcerated at some time during adolescence, give birth as a teenager, and face unemployment as a young adult."" Like the quote said before in my last point, high quality sex education reportedly can increase the use of contraceptives and condoms which, in turn, can reduce teen pregnancy. This can improve the futures of many teen girls and boys, as most teens may not be ready for a child, especially when most of them are still living at home and are in the care of their own parents."

51	S212ed27a-A6d023861	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Laptops in Class	"Profuse thanks again to Alyssa! At this time, I will--as per the structure laid out in the OP--rebut Pro's opening arguments.C1. Portable College EducationI have two arguments against this contention:(1) Topicality. The topic of this debate is about the use of laptops in schools or colleges, it is not about the use of laptops as schools or colleges. Now, while on the face of it, this may seem like quibbling, there is a significant difference in using a laptop as a classroom or study aid and in using the laptop as the classroom itself. I am therefore concerned about the topicality of this whole argument, or, at least, of parts of this argument.(2) Effectiveness. Online courses are, not surprisingly, not nearly as effective as real-life classes. This mirrors the arguments I have been making regarding how note-taking on laptops isn't as effective as longhand note-taking and so on. Several sources and arguments corroborate the claim that online courses just aren't doing students as much good.(2a) Student success and matriculation rates in online courses are less than in real-life courses""[I]n 2012, 60.4 percent of students enrolled in online courses completed them with a passing grade--10 percentage points lower than the success rate of 70.6 percent in traditional courses."" [1]""Preliminary data on UT-Austin’s two other fall semester MOOCs [(massive open online courses)] show completion rates ranging from about 1 percent to 3 percent. These rates aren't unusual...[T]he University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education presented a study on 16 MOOCs offered by the University of Pennsylvania through a company called Coursera. They found that completion rates averaged at around 4 percent."" [2]""The research has shown over and over again that community college students who enroll in online courses are significantly more likely to fail or withdraw than those in traditional classes, which means that they spend hard-earned tuition dollars and get nothing in return. Worse still, low-performing students who may be just barely hanging on in traditional classes tend to fall even further behind in online courses."" [3] ""A five-year study, issued in 2011, tracked 51,000 students enrolled in Washington State community and technical colleges. It found that those who took higher proportions of online courses were less likely to earn degrees or transfer to four-year colleges."" [3](2b) For many students, online courses are less effective teaching methods""First, student attrition rates--around 90 percent for some huge online courses--appear to be a problem even in small-scale online courses when compared with traditional face-to-face classes. Second, courses delivered solely online may be fine for highly skilled, highly motivated people, but they are inappropriate for struggling students who make up a significant portion of college enrollment and who need close contact with instructors to succeed...Lacking confidence as well as competence, these students need engagement with their teachers to feel comfortable and to succeed. What they often get online is estrangement from the instructor who rarely can get to know them directly. "" [3](2c) Online courses enlarge racial disparities in education""Researchers also found that achievement gaps are exacerbated in the online world. For example, the gap between white and African American students in traditional classes was 12.9 percentage points; that widens to 17.5 points in online courses."" [1]C2: Instant Data AccessImagine you're sitting in class, and your teacher mentions topic X. You look it up. You start reading the online article, and five or ten minutes later you realize you got so absorbed in the article that you missed a portion of the lecture. Instant data access may sound like a boon, but in fact it is merely one more potential distractor in the classroom. Why not wait to look up a topic later in the library? Why does data access need to be ""instant,"" when the very fact that it is instantaneous is problematic?C3: Efficient Use of TimeAgain, I have three quick points to raise by way of objection:(1) Lack of Evidence. My opponent makes the assertion that laptops can be a great way of maximizing efficient use of time. Perhaps that's true when they are used wisely, but Pro offers us no evidence that this is how they're used. For instance, instead of looking at school material on my laptop, I might just spend that time perusing through facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Without any empirical data, Pro cannot make the claim that laptops actually, and on balance, maximize students productive use of time. Certainly, the evidence I've presented about distractability speaks to the contrary.(2) Weight. Even if you buy Pro's claims that laptops help students use time efficiently, there are several reasons why you should weigh my evidence on distraction and information retention/comprehension more heavily:(2a) ""Measurability."" My arguments are quantified; by this I mean I am citing measurable, statistical impacts to my claims. We should always prefer claims that are clear and measurable to claims whose overall impacts are indeterminate and vague. After all, we know what harms will transpire if we affirm, but we can only speculate at the benefits.(2b) Severity. My impacts are more severe that Pro's impacts. Efficient use of time may reap some benefits, but if those benefits aren't paying off on tests (as shown by my arguments) then those benefits clear aren't outweighing the harms.(3) Permutation. We can use desktops or library computers to help us organize and store our files and so forth. Surely, even if we have to walk back to our dorms or to the library to use these machines, they still save time on average by automating, organizing, and storing things, etc., just like laptops do. So, while these might not save as much time as laptops, they would still save some time. Therefore, why bother having laptops when they have clear harms (e.g. they increase distraction rates in the classroom), and when a large chunk of their benefits could be reaped without them?C4: Efficient use of SpaceCross-apply all of the attacks I made against Pro's C3 here, as they all fit.C5: Saving TreesI have two issues with this contention:(1) Topicality. Recall, the resolution asks whether laptop use is ""beneficial for the student."" This contention doesn't elucidate any benefit for the student, but rather talks about a benefit to the environment; thus, it's not topical.(2) Permutation. Desktops can also minimize the harms to the environment while not incurring the same harms as laptops.C6: DistractionUnfortunately, I cannot access the source for this study (404 error). I would ask Pro to please provide it in the comments, and I promise to rebut it next round. I would prefer to discuss distraction next round anyway, as that is where the bulk of those arguments are concentrated.But, from what I can ascertain just from what was posted, the study only surveyed/pertained to one class. Moreover, it confirmed that there was a distraction factor when students ""multitasked."" To quote Pro directly: ""you're taking a class on something you don't know about and you multitask, you're going to score about 10% less on an end of lecture test."" So, really, this only it reinforces my argument.C7: To the FutureUltimately, we might save money switching to online classes, but, as evidence by my earlier studies/sources, online classrooms are less effective than traditional classrooms. It is not, it seems to me, beneficial to the student to exchange quality for cost savings, esp. when we can find other ways to cut costs besides going digital.SOURCES1 - http://www.utsandiego.com...2 - https://www.texastribune.org...3 - http://www.nytimes.com..."

51	S2a5bda38-Ae146ca1b	1	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Safe sex should be taught in public schools instead of abstinence.	"I'll continue to clarify my reply from round 1. Having ""safe sex"" taught in public schools is impossible because there is no such thing as ""safe sex,"" which I've established in round 1. Instead, I would suggest looking at options which are technically possible such as: abstinence-plus/comprehensive sex education, abstinence-only sex education, nothing at all, or possibly another type of program. Abstinence-plus/ comprehensive sex education is generally defined in literature as teaching about condoms in addition to the choice of abstinence. Abstinence-only education in literature is generally defined as teaching that abstinence is the only way to go. If the abstinence-only curriculum talks about condoms it's in terms of failure rates. According to the Waxman Report (1), in abstinence-only education there's also a lot of misleading information such as anatomy and physiology errors, errors concerning contraception, and gender stereotypes taught within popular curricula. Researchers such as Douglas Kirby and DeClemente would suggest comprehensive sex education since, compared to abstinence-only sex education, it reduces high risk sexual behavior and increases the likelihood of condom use with first intercourse. The studies they refer to normally have abstinence only as a comparison group since it acts as a better control group than no form of sex education at all. We're left to infer that comprehensive sex education is better than no sex education. If there is a conflict with whether sex education belongs in the public school system there is the option for no sex education. This is also an option. However, we're left with questions such as who will provide this information if the school won't? If information is provided elsewhere, can we be confident students will get information from accurate sources? Can we be confident parents are always willing and are competent to teach sex education? Is it not the student's right to have knowledge in order to make better informed decisions, especially when it concerns their own well being? In summary here, in a choice between ""safe sex"" education and abstinence-only it's clear we don't have a choice because technically there is no such thing as ""safe sex"" education. If we recognize that there are more choices than ""safe sex"" education (which technically is impossible and therefore not really a choice) and abstinence only (which doesn't sound too wonderful), we can look at other options such as comprehensive sex education or no sex education at all. My argument is that we technically cannot choose the option given. Therefore, we must choose an option we technically can choose; so, we must choose something else. Also, as the band Rush so wisely states: ""If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice."" References: 1. http://oversight.house.gov..."

51	Sb8c9af14-Aaab6291	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Children need to be exposed to the opposite sex in preparation for later life	The formative years of children are the best time to expose them to the company of the other gender, in order that they may learn each other’s’ behaviour and be better prepared for adult life. Moreover, the school's role is to prepare its students for life which involves interaction between the sexes, by preventing inter-sexual interaction we hurt the role of the school significantly. The effects of same-sex schools are significant. This creates segregation men and women, this which as a result of a lack of contact between them can create fear and uneasiness between them. This might be compatred to segregation between black and white in the USA or South Africa where the resulting racism and troubles to bond has yet to heal. We already live in a society where women are discriminated against, segregation cannot be the answer to this. Furthermore, the number of subjects benefiting from single-sex discussion is so small that this could easily be organised within a co-educational system. Furthermore, even if girls naturally perform better in an environment without boys, they need to learn how to perform just as well with boys. Dr. Alan Smithers, a respected British schools expert, declared in a 2006 report that ‘distraction by boys was a myth’ and that ‘half a century of research has not shown any dramatic or consistent advantages for single-sex education for boys or girls’.[1] [1] Asthana, A. ‘Single-sex schools ‘no benefit to girls’’.

51	S861da101-A5653ac85	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single-sex education	"This round I will form rebuttals and counterarguments to my opponent’s contentions. Thank you for presenting your arguments. I will do my best to accurately represent them while avoiding a straw man. 1. Students from single-sex schools are better academically than mixed-sex schools ""Do Single-Sex Schools Improve the Education of Low-Income and Minority Students? An Investigation of California's Public Single-Gender Academies"" The title of that article already throws up a red flag. I try to avoid bias and remain as objective as possible; however, with respect to this situation, it appears the education pool has already been greatly diminished. The vast majority of single-sex institutions are private, and therefore the tuition is exponentially high for a low-income or minority student. “In the 2009-2010 school year, according to the National Association of Independent Schools, or NAIS, the average tuition at day private high schools stood at $19,906 a year, while boarding schools averaged $40,875. The tuition is even higher for the most elite prep schools.”[1] 1 $11,490 2 $15,510 3 $19,530 4 $23,550 5 $27,570 6 $31,590 7 $35,610 8 $39,630 [2] ""Several teachers also commented that the setting made certain actions unlikely. When boys did not have girls present, they felt less need to show off, act out, or engage in attention-getting behavior. Likewise, girls who did not have boys present did not have to vie for their attention. Instead of competing with each other, girls learned to work collaboratively, bond as friends, and became more focused on their academic work."" This statement entirely ignores the necessary growth and development of the child with respect to social skills. The whole paradigm of boy-girl relationships is tantamount to the interactions of men and women in their later years. This statement is also from the perspective of the teacher, not the student. Observation is a flawed skill, and cannot accurately represent the students true intentions or emotions. Also, cooperation is not restricted to single-sex education. The point of intersex cooperation also needs to be mentioned. Cooperation among one’s own sex can easily be achieved through segregation in a co-educational setting; however, the converse cannot, in a single-sex institution the “cooperation” is limited by its very nature. For the remainder your argument not much needs to be said. You are committing a false cause fallacy by assuming because the test scores are higher, it must be the result of the lack of the opposite sex. In reality, the selectivity results in the demand for higher education values, thus the teachers typically have prestigious degrees. The achieved result is in the greater attainment of knowledge. This is not due to separation of sexes. 2. Students from single-sex schools don't have any sociability problem Due to time restraints, I will have to keep this short. I already referenced social ability in my previous rebuttal; however, I will expound upon it in short. Self-Esteem and Educational and Career Aspirations are used to describe SS students; however, I again assert that this is a result of private education, not a result of single-sex education. The study shows other researches showing that Delinquency is lower on SS school students. This does not mean that CE schools student are more delinquent than SS, just shows that they have an environment less favourable to develop a delinquent. As stated before, the lack of the opposite sex favours friendship over competition between the classmates. Boys won't be fighting for a girls won't be doing crazy things for a boy's love. A lack of Delinquency again results from the selectivity and the increase in academic integrity that is a side effect of a prestigious private education. Again forming relationships with the opposite sex is a crucial aspect of youth. “Competition” in this sense may be a good thing, but I also go to a co-educational school, and competition is not an issue, nor are girls constantly “doing crazy things for a boy’s love”. I fail to see how eating disorders are the result of separation of sexes. That appears to be a red herring and therefore possesses no validity in this argument. ""You can come like in the morning.. and you don't have to put like make up on because we're girls and if there were guys here...[We would be thinking],'Oh my god, I can't go like this.""(4) One girl’s opinion does not accurately represent the whole. Again it seems as if a logical fallacy is at work. A hasty generalization appears to be the case. The American Council for CoEducational Schooling put together a report, The Pseudoscience of Single Sex Schooling, which worked down to break some of the ""cherry picked"" claims that back same-sex education. In this report, the organization asserted that single-sex education reinforces sex stereotypes, arguing, ""Boys who spend more time with other boys become increasingly aggressive,"" while ""girls who spend more time with other girls become more sex-typed."" The lead author of the report, Diane Halpern asserts, ""It’s simply not true that boys and girls learn differently,"" reminding readers that ""we used to believe that the races learned differently, too.""[3] “Although much has been said about the benefits of same-sex schools, not many are touting the benefits of the old standby of coeducation. According to the ACLU, some studies find that students in coeducational schools can do better than single-sex students. And the ACLU is quick to point out that same-sex schools that do well are successful not because they are segregated, but because they have the hallmarks of good educational environments, including small classes, adequate funding, parental involvement, and qualified teachers, which help bring about success in coeducational classrooms as well. The ACLU underlines that socialization, competition, and collaboration between sexes in school prepares students for success in the real world as well, as real life is not separated by gender.”[3] One last thing needs to be said in regards to your personal argument. As I said earlier, I attend a private institution. It is ranked very highly in the United States, where I live, and it operates as a co-educational school.[4]I thought I would throw in a personal argument simply to counteract yours.

51	Se69d093e-A7e9f8927	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexual sex is more harmful than heterosexual sex	"Thanks, Pro. I look forward to an interesting debate. 1. Homosexual men do engage in anal sex more often than heterosexuals. However anal sex among homosexuals is not inherently more dangerous. It is only more dangerous because gay men have higher rates of STDs, which brings me to my next point. 2. STDs can largely be prevented by using protection. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that latex condoms provide an essentially impermeable barrier to particles the size of STD pathogens [1]. They are over 98 percent effective. Ergo, assuming both homosexuals and heterosexuals in controlled environments are having sex (wearing condoms), they will be equally protected against STDs. Condoms do not favor one demographic over the other. A 2010 Journal of Sexuality study found that if we were to define ""gay sex"" as non-vaginal sex, specifically oral and anal sex, then anytime two heterosexual people have oral or anal sex (not to mention BDSM or kink or group sex or role playing or masturbation), they are engaging in the very same activities that qualify as gay sex [2]. For instance more than 1/5 women engage in anal sex. Why is a blow job or anal sex inherently more dangerous amongst gays than straights? It's not. High-risk groups for STDs include anyone who, within the past 10 years, has engaged in intravenous drug use, resided in Haiti or Central Africa, received multiple blood transfusions, or who is a hemophiliac or a regular sex partner of any of these people - not just homosexuals. I would argue there are high risk groups that extend beyond general sexual preference. Gay people who use protection will have INFINITELY less STDs than gay people who do not use protection, thus there are other variables to consider aside from sexuality. 3. Most importantly, lesbians qualify as homosexuals and homosexuals are the (sexuality) demographic with the least amount of STDs. Consider the fact that 88,000 women in the U.S. were diagnosed with the STD pelvic inflammatory disease [3] and out of those cases, 2 were lesbians [4]. In other words, lesbians account for about 0.0022727272727273% of those cases. The thing is, a penis is more likely to spread STDs than a vagina. That's not bias, that's clear biology and scientific fact. A penis + vagina and a penis + penis both = higher STD rates. Vagina + vagina does not [4]. Bisexual women are 3x more likely to have STDs than lesbians [5]. Indeed lots of government research has been done proving that bisexual women who have sex with men are up to 17% of greater risk for STIs than their lesbian peers [6]. Again this is due to basic biology and the way disease is spread. Sex is safer when none of your partner""s bodily fluids (vaginal secretions, breast milk or blood - including menstruation) enter your body. This is a biological fact [7]. It's easier to spread/transmit/insert fluid and other organisms with a penis; a penis penetrates which makes it easier to swap bacteria and viruses. The risk for STDs among lesbians is lower than sex involving a man because less bodily fluids are exchanged between women. Therefore, at the very best, this resolution only applies to 1/2 the homosexual population - gay men. But lesbians qualify as homosexuals, and lesbian sex is safer than heterosexual sex. Thus Pro has not fulfilled his burden. 4. Another thing to consider about lesbians is that if/when they do use penetration in sex, they might use sex toys instead of a real penis. While a heterosexual man (or woman) with an STD risks transmitting their STD, lesbians can use toys in place of real body parts, and toys don't have STDs. 5. Heterosexual sex poses the risk of pregnancy. Pregnancy carries with it a plethora of possible health related issues and complications [8]. Gay sex does not yield the possibility of pregnancy or any of the related problems. I look forward to seeing where this debate takes us. Thanks again! [1] http://www.cdc.gov...

51	S48c4bfcb-A21dc60ee	2	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex Education should be taught in public schools.	"Ok if you want to explain my points further, then I will. I. Unbiased means teaching the facts. The various examples you posted are no facts they are clear over exaggerations. 1. How to rape 2. Why smoking is good 3. Do drugs 4. Become Anorexic 5. Surpass the brink of obesity In cases were both sides have some valid points, such as two politicians debating about the economy or foreign policy, then that's unbiased because it is presenting facts and both points of view. In the points above, the facts about smoking, drugs, obesity, anorexia, and rape are all obviously clear - they end up hurting you one way or another; any other information given would be lies and turn from an unbiased education to propaganda. Moreover, the above examples make the implication that sex can be ranked among the list above, ranked with smoking, drugs, obesity as if it was something that can lead to a cancer or other disease. Sex is proven to be a necessary bodily function and a person actually NEEDS to have sex for their own health and to continue life. To rank sex or even imply that sex could be ranked with the above just shows how little knowledge of the subject you actually have. You also say ""All these things are good from the perspective of the person doing…"" I know many people who wished they didn't smoke, could control their sexual impulses, weren't addicted to drugs and are trying to quit, and want to loose weight. I will give you that anorexia is the exception. To end, by unbiased you knew perfectly well I was talking about not drilling the Bible in schools. For to long ""moral entrepreneurs"" have shoved their ideas and beliefs in our faces and it needs to stay out of the classroom because then the education becomes biased. Just because they are a majority doesn't give them the right to unduly influence non-Christian students with their personal beliefs. II. To not teach Sex Education would be harmful to students. In a perfect world, every parent would pass on the knowledge they need to conduct safe and happy sex lives, but in reality we know this doesn't happen. Talking about sex with a child, especially your own child can be very difficult. Parents, more often than not, like to live in their bubble and think every other kids is doing it but not mine. This is what ultimately led to sex education, parents weren't teaching it and somebody had to. Here's my theory, if cavemen were able to figure out ""how to do it"" then two teenagers growing up in a world were sex permeates almost all of our most daily activities, from television commercials and advertisements to asking were babies come from, they will find out about sex. The problem is they will know about it, but not know everything that they need to conduct sex safely. They learn about friends who don't know what they're talking about, or inexperienced older brothers and sisters, or the occasional stranger or teacher. 2 out of 3 will give misinformation. Unless a child in forbidden from leaving the house or watching TV one way or another sex will come up, that isn't even a question, even if you put a guy and a girl on a deserted island they will figure it out. That means they need to be prepared and prepared properly. Abstinence programs have been attempted to no avail. One study done in Texas by the British Medical Journal revealed that ""before the abstinence education 23% of ninth-graders have had sex, 28% did after the program was finished."" Then another study by the Center for Disease Control found that those who took ""virginity pledges"" delayed in any sexual activity by 6 months. But after that, they discovered oral and anal sex, which are apparently still ok somehow, and didn't know a thing about the use of condoms, birth control, or any other forms of safe sex. They were also more likely to get a STD than those who had a real sex education. Eventually 88% go on to have pre-marital sex. Even the ones who remain virgins until marriage, they still eventually have sex, and just because your married doesn't mean you're safe from STDs. Furthermore, going back to my contentions about the difference between and unbiased education and teaching the facts. According to a Washington Post study, in abstinence only education they are actually ""taught"" Half the gay male teenagers in the U.S. have AIDS. (Another ""fact"" is that only homosexuals can get AIDS.) Touching a persons genitals can result in pregnancy (there are other variations like oral sex, masturbation, and the like could do the same). A forty three-day-old fetus is a ""thinking person"" (their brain has sometimes not even developed by this point). AIDS can be spread through sweat and tears Condoms fail to protect the transmission of AIDS 31% of the time – the actual number is 3% according to the Center for Disease control. Women who have abortions are ""more prone to suicide"" and as many as 10% become sterile. Just slightly biased don't you think? Finally, a word on morals. It might be against one person's morals to teach sex education in schools, but I know for sure that that isn't everyone's morals. Because there isn't a definite majority (like 98% lets say), since there are conflicting morals, the facts should be taught at schools and the morals taught at home. The schools has no right to preach to me about sex when I and my parents would much rather I learn about safe practices instead of propaganda spread by these self-proclaimed ""moral entrepreneurs."""

All school should be gender exclusive	Same sex education is something that has almost always been an option, and has not negatively influenced the society yet. Let's start off with the basics. Single sex schools provide a safer environment in both a mental and physical aspect. Being in an all female/male school, it's not likely for your child to be sexually harassed and/or attacked. Your child would not have to worry about the pressure of being sexually active either (considering a majority of the population is heterosexual).

I have forgotten to mention that my arguments will be based on the point of view of the United States. In general, however, the contender may bring up arguments based on worldwide statistics. The primary issue with having Friday as part of the weekend is simple: America, as a country, is ""uneducated"" in relation to other countries. Many people who disagree with this topic point their attention to a decline in national test scores for both middle and high school students. On a roll of forty countries, America was placed in twenty-fifth place for highest scores on a standardized test. However, there has been no proof that this low statistic is due to the number of days in the workweek. Other factors, such as a school's budget and the quality of school instructors, make a larger impact on productivity than more days. In ABC's documentary ""Stupid in America"", one mother of a child who goes to a United States public school, stated that she could teacher her child more in one week than the school could in the entire semester. This example itself proves that higher quality instructors can increase the learning in their classrooms in shorter times. To conclude my turn of round 2, keeping Friday will not help the situation America is in, and a higher number of days in the school week doesn't necessarily guarantee a better education. Though I have more reasons for this debate, I wish for my opponent to respond to these topics: agree or disagree and why. (1) http://reason.com... http://www.youtube.com..."

THBT sex education must be taught in High School students in the Philippines	"i believe that sex education should not be taught to high school students even if they are in the 3rd year of their high school or the 4th. especially in the Philippines since as i know from some Filipino friends that Filipinos are people who are conservative and values their virginity measuring it equal with their own dignity. i mean to say that when one teaches sex education to teenagers the cases of premarital sex will increase since they can perform sex with the following certain guidelines to prevent unwanted pregnancy. i am not saying that sex education teaches one to perform sex or to teach them of procedures in performing sex, what i am saying is that when one engage in sex education one can follow guidelines to prevent unwanted events to happen after intercourse and since Filipinos treasure virginity, they may be tempted to do it since they know how to prevent unwanted event that may occur after sex and this becomes a violation of tradition. i am also aware of your statement that conservative attitudes have led to more cases of STD and teenage pregnancy, but can you define ""conservative attitudes"" more since in general conservative attitudes is the rejection of sex education and therefore the rejection in partaking in any sexual activity that will help in the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and spread of diseases. Thus, it will not be a point for you but a point for me. sex education should not be taught still to high school students since maturity of one person can not be based through ones age. in general, i may agree to teaching people of sex education but only the mentally prepared and people who voluntarily enrolls oneself to join lessons for sex education. finally, sex education should not be taught to high school students, not unless they can handle it individually, since they already have many school work, to handle another bundle of workload. school is also not the only place where you can learn or have sex education as your speech have said teaching them to high school students means teaching them in school. with that i end my speech. please forgive me for some errors since i haven't checked on it after i have typed it. hope to hear from you soon. thank you."

I have weighed the opportunity cost of one and the other, coming to decide which one prepares me better for the real world. You have been insisting that the female school has helped YOU achieve more than you could in co educational schools. However, the world is not all bout you, all about the females. We are both women, we both know that females mature earlier than males. In fact boys and girls are a good influence on each other, engendering good behaviour and maturity – particularly as teenage girls usually exhibit greater responsibility than boys of the same age. We can actually help the males! :D Academic competition between the sexes is a spur to better performance at school. You are exactly right that we go to school to learn, not to interact with the opposite sex. In the coeducational schools, I have competed with males student, learned their logical thinking process and influenced to be better in maths and science. I didn't date any of the males when I was in college. If the individual has strong self control, then he/she would not be distracted by the opposite sex. We live and learn, if we are not open to the new things, to the rest of the world, we will be left behind. At some point in our lives males and females need to learn to work together. It's good preparation for the real world! In real world, it is not about just one gender. Even if you obtained higher academic achievement in your previous single sex school, that is not the only thing society measures you at. Co educational schools give both male and female students an opportunity to see how the other works under stress, offer more practical studies such as engineering courses and larger variety of computer technology courses. Again, it's useful experience for the real world. Merry Christmas to your family as well! I am sure you have lovely kids just like youself.:)	CON	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S6bece754-Aa72f8d62	2	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Comprehensive Sex Education	"Thank you Pro! I will use this round for my opening arguments, and use the next round for rebuttals. Introduction: There are parent’s who don’t want their children to be taught sex education in school, just as there are teachers who feel that it’s not their job to teach sex education. There are some families, who have strict morals. They may encourage their children, not to have sex, until they are married. Their parents may have talked to them about the risks, and bad outcomes of having sex already. When any type of sex education is taught, including abstinence, it gets kids to thinking, and talking about it with their friends. Some of their friends may have already has sex, and tell their friends, whom are virgins, that “it’s okay to have sex” because “Nothing bad happened” to them. Pupils may become persuaded, and tempted to go out and have sex, since their friends are doing it, this is called peer pressure. I will be arguing: 1. It's not a teachers duty to teach sex education. 2. Comprehensive sex education is innefective 3. Sex education is a waste of the goverments money. I will also touch some on immorality. C.1 It’s Not a Teacher’s Duty to Teach Sex Education A study in 2010, discovered that 1 in 3 schools are not teaching sex education properly, merely because teachers are too embarrassed to discuss it, or have little knowledge on the topic. [1] “The report said sex had been ""squeezed out"" from the curriculum because ""since the topics were particularly sensitive, some teachers felt uncomfortable in teaching such demanding themes…Students may still be subject to embarrassment or excitable by subject matter. If not taught properly, sex education in school can become a matter of ridicule and students may not take any interest in it.” How are we to know, that the teachers are teaching this effectively? Who says that the program of sex education they’re teaching is proper? Are we asking children if they are even comfortable with being taught on such a topic at their age? When you’re young, you may make sex jokes with friends and such, but not feel comfortable to talk to an adult about sex. When a teacher whom is un-experienced in the topic, and nervous, it causes a chain reaction, making children nervous themselves, and confused. Especially if the teacher doesn’t exactly know what he, or she is teaching. [2] “Mostly teachers who are given the task of teaching sex education to students are not experts and have vague ideas about sexual health themselves. This is even more harmful as incorrect information is extremely lethal as it can actually leave a wrong impression on the students. Children have an impressionable mind and incorrect information imparted at an early age can actually transform them into ignorant adults.” I think we can all agree, that parents are the most qualified to teach their own children about sex, considering they have had a child, unless the child was adopted. They also can teach children what they (as in the parents) want their children to know. Maybe they would rather teach their children about abstinence, rather than comprehensive. C.2 Comprehensive Sex Education is Ineffective. Why do we study history? Well, for 1 main reason I can think of, is to not repeat mistakes from the past. We can do the same thing with comprehensive sex education. Comprehensive sex originated in Sweden in 1950, and the ideas and teachings spread throughout the world. In the late 70’s many studies were done to show that comprehensive teachings are in fact, ineffective. [3] “From 1971 to 1981, government funding at all levels for contraceptive education increased by 4,000 percent. During that time, teen pregnancies increased by 20 percent and teen abortions nearly doubled.5 “ “A 1986 Johns Hopkins University study concluded that comprehensive sex education did not reduce teen pregnancies,6 a finding replicated by other studies.” “A 1986 Lou Harris Poll, commissioned by Planned Parenthood (a leading sponsor of comprehensive sex education), found that teens who took a comprehensive sex education course (including contraceptive education) were significantly more likely to initiate sexual intercourse than teens whose sex education courses did not discuss contraceptives.7 “ As study in 2002, showed that sex education had very little influence on teenager’s sexual lifestyle, and choices. [4] One of the biggest studies ever conducted on the impact of sex education delivered by teachers suggested that specially designed programme aimed at Scottish secondary school pupils had no more impact on adolescents' sexual activity or risk taking than conventional lessons although it increased their knowledge of sexual health and marginally improved relationships. And a review of research in the US and Canada indicated that pregnancy prevention programmes for 11-18, including sex education classes, family planning clinics and other outside school initiatives had not delayed sexual intercourse, improved birth control or reduced teenage pregnancies. ` C.3 Sex Education is a waste of Money. [4] From “1971 to 1986 the government spent $2 billion of taxpayer’s money on sex education. During this same period, the number of girls who became pregnant while using contraceptives rose 266%. There was also a 107% increase in those who had abortions and a 93% increase to those who contracted STDs.” The purpose of comprehensive sex edu, is to teach kids, and teens how to have safe sex. Either A) the reason why the rates are high, is because teachers are not teaching kids properly, or B) kids honestly don’t care, at all. Kids and Teens will do what they please. [4] “Usually a successful program is not brought by teachers, it’s brought by parents,” says Liz Sanchez, curriculum coordinator for the ) . “Get even one parent you know and bring them in. Educational systems respond to parents.” This goes back to my beginning arguments. Teachers don’t feel comfortable teaching sex to other people’s children, they may have the right to, but it’s simply not their job. C.4 Immorality of Sex Education If we look of the definition of “Comprehensive Sex Education” it will read: [5] “teaches about abstinence as the best method for avoiding STDs and unintended pregnancy, but also teaches about condoms and contraception to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and of infection with STDs, including HIV. It also teaches interpersonal and communication skills and helps young people explore their own values, goals, and options.” But in today’s current teachings, we are making children perform uncomfortable exercises, and parent’s aren’t comfortable, nor are they happy about it. [6] “Most comprehensive sex-ed curricula contain sexually explicit and offensive materials. For example, curricula have students practice unrolling condoms on bananas, cucumbers, or model phalluses. Curricula also contain discussions of anal sex and homosexual role-playing and encourage teens to practice mutual masturbation and watch erotic movies. Much material in “abstinence plus” curricula would be alarming to parents.” For example, the curriculum Be Proud! Be Responsible! instructs teachers to: “Invite [students] to brainstorm ways to increase spontaneity and the likelihood that they’ll use condoms…. Examples: …Store condoms under mattress; Eroticize condom use with partner…Use condoms as a method of foreplay.… Think up a sexual fantasy using condoms….Act sexy/sensual when putting condoms on…. Hide them on your body and ask your partner to find it. Wrap them as a present and give to your partner before a romantic dinner. Tease each other manually while putting on the condom” I think we all can agree that these sorts of things, stated above, should not be a focus of a child in middle school, or high-school. By having kids perform these exercise, and giving them ideas, we are almost convincing them to go out and have sex, and there is always risks involve while having sex, even when using a condom, because they are not always effective. I wish my opponent good luck on the next round! :) Sources: [1]http://www.telegraph.co.uk... [2] http://www.onlymyhealth.com... [3] Where-Sex-Education-Went-Wrong [4]http://www.battlefortruth.org...

51	Sc158c234-Af9e455c7	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	This House Believes Single Sex Schools Are Better For Education	"I apologise. Unexpected opportunities for socialising arose. Well, you haven't really refuted my argument, you merely took the opportunity to focus entirely upon the academic aspect of education. Instinctively I suspected that there was far more at play than a simple coed / single sex dichotomy. Indeed, I know from personal experience that single sex schools are likely to be both highly selective and expensive. Satisfyingly, my thoughts are corroborated. ""As Faye Crosby, a professor of psychology at Smith College, and other critics have observed, Tidball did not control for characteristics of women's colleges, apart from sexual homogeneity, that might well account for the success of their graduates. She did not allow for the socio-economic privileges shared by many graduates of elite women's colleges or for the selectivity of the schools.""[1] Furthermore: ""Tidball's subsequent finding, that single-sex schools produce more female achievers in the sciences and medicine, also collapses under scrutiny. Faye Crosby and her Smith colleagues found in a comparison of similarly selective single-sex and coeducational schools that ""women's colleges are not more productive."" There are no definitive comparative data on the benefits of single-sex colleges for women. ""Data are slim,"" Crosby writes, ""but they indicate that coeducational schools are as likely to produce women scientists as are women's colleges.""[ibid. p.2] In the same article, there is also a comment by sociologist Cynthia Epstein regarding the apparent superiority of single sex schools: ""There does not seem to be research support for this perspective"". It does not seem to be true, then, that your study is reliable. Even if I were to grant the truth of your study, what would this prove? Apparently, that single sex schools are better for girls. My issue with this is that we are discussing education for both sexes, and so you must prove it is better for both. I notice that your arguments have, on the whole, been rather feminist - discussions of 'sexual harassment', the focus on girls, and the idea that men are the 'aggressors' (a key feminist tenet). In the debate over coed and single sex education there is in general a rather sexist attitude - boys are incapable of keeping their hands off the girls, who are in turn 'frightened' and 'bullied'. These are two classic genders stereotypes, and they are always perpetuated by the side arguing in favour of single sex education. This is suggests to me that instead of challenging sexual inequalities through education, those in favour of single sex education are in fact promoting sexual inequalities by pandering to gender stereotypes. In my eyes, the position of those in favour of single sex education's superiority are in this mindset: 'Rather than teach our students how to coexist with the other sex, separate them!'. If you desire to create a world where males and females are equal and cohesive, then they must be educated together, for if they spend their education believing that men and women are irreconcilable, then they will likely believe this for their adult lives too.

I would like to counter his counter refutations and then re-inforce my own points once more. Please do not counter counter counter refute. It gets a bit silly then ;). Fifth round will be short, concluding words with key refutations and summing up the argument.Counter counter-refutations 1. Students need [to] interact with the people of other gender, but now-a-days it is very necessary to learn that at a very early stage.First of all, my opponent did not provide a source so we can count this as speculative. Second of all, I harken back to your quote of the woman who felt out of place briefly at college. There is no, I repeat no evidence that single-sex schools have done damage to people after their first awkward period of college. I'm sure this woman lives a healthy life interacting with students of both genders.2. My point was not that children should be told that they are worse than boys, but they must realise that there are some students who are better than them at some subjects and they need to [improve] themselves to survive in the competition. This very indirectly counter refutes my refutation. It is pretty irrelevant. What I am saying is, by having a football team that only boys join, and a cheerleading team that only girls join, we are perpetuating gender stereotypes. Computer classes that are not required are mostly boys, and home ed classes are mostly girls. Using single-sex schools, we can teach students that it doesn't matter if computer is a ""boy"" subject. They can do this class free of ridicule.3. No teacher can provide students what they would have gotten by interacting and discussing with one another. There is no source cited to this, so we can assume it is just an opinion. According to the NASSPE (National Association of Single-Sex Public Education), single-sex teachers are very trained in targeting gender nuances and expressing ideas to students of all one gender.4. Every student has a different learning style and capability irrespective of his/her gender. There are many ways each gender differs. Go to a seven year old boy and a seven year old girl and ask this question: ""How long can you stand still and be quiet"" and you will find very different answers. They are built into our brains. Teachers that teach at single sex schools are very trained in teaching to these different genders. Why do you think they segregate schools in to different grades? Second grade is for seven year olds and fourth grade is for nine year olds, because there are significant differences in the way that they learn, and what they have learned so far. It is the same for girls and boys. Girls respond to calmness in a teacher and sounds, while boys respond to visual cues and funny and loud teachers. A girl might be intimidated by a singlesex boys teacher and a boy might be bored by a single-sex girls teacher. Source is the NASSPE5. Cheerleading is a very popular sport and many girls are interested in cheerleading. This is because girls can't play on the football team and boys can't cheerlead. From a young age at co-ed schools we are taught that football is for boys and cheerleading is for girls. Girls don't cheerlead because it is fun. I mean, they do, but the underlying reason is that they are taught that they don't play football. Points1. Students and single-sex schools perform better than those at co-ed schools. Especially with the amount of flunking students at high schools nowadays, we cannot leave any stone unturned. Any method thatcan up grades significantly needs to be implemented.2. Males and females have different learning styles which must be treated differently. By treating aforementioned differences we can raise learning efficiency.3. Single-sex education promotes gender equality. I find myself coming back to the football cheerleading example again and again. We can teachs students that they can be whoever they want to be without fear of being judged, or without being told that ""they can't join the football team"".4. Students have a life outside of class. Single-sex students are not locked inside their school. Along with extra-cirricular events, inter school events occur and let students interact.Your move.

51	S63d0848d-A1eaff833	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	single sex schools are more effective than co-ed schools	first I would like to point out what is the schools actual job is. They basically have to give you all of the necessary knowledge along with helping you get prepared for the life ahead of you. Now single sex schools are proved to not differ from co-ed schools in student performance, but in single sex schools you take a part of 'preparing for the life ahead' away. Students do not achieve a 'normal' childhood, since they are not in enough contact with the opposite sex. And this has a massive side effect. Students are not able to communicate properly with the opposite sex, making it harder for them to find partners or keeping one in the first place. Also sex education becomes difficult, since students didn't have much contact with the opposite sex. Being in a co-ed school also makes people more subjective. They think more creatively than students in single sex schools since in co-ed schools both boys and girls experience different emotions, which students in single sex schools can't achieve in the same level. This also means that differentiating emotions themselves, so basically knowing what you are feeling in the moment, is later on difficult for single sex students, since they didn't have enough experience in all of the emotions. http://www.independent.co.uk... http://www.ncgs.org... http://www.apa.org...

"So, I will start with my rebuttal.""Either way, my point remains that the real-life evidence shows otherwise in that teenage pregnancies have dropped over time [1]. If teenagers couldn't comprehend the consequences, then they wouldn't think to use contraceptives, as they wouldn't know the risk of pregnancy.""Even if there was a drop in pregnancies, the U.S. still remains with the highest rate in teen pregancies in the western world.""The AAP’s “Policy Statement—Sexuality, Contraception and the Media,” published in August 2010 notes that, “According to the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 46% of all high school seniors have had sexual intercourse, and 14% have had 4 partners or more.

Besides, there is still a chance they could get pregnant either way, with or without the condom. ""Other than total sexual abstinence, only condoms currently provide significant protection against HIV and other STIs. Condoms cannot protect against viral infections on portions of the anatomy that condoms do not cover."" http://www.themediaproject.com...

Therfore, that goes along with women leaving there husbands, killing their children (abortion), and becomming lesbians (fragile relationships which leaves each gender mistrusting the other).Here is more evidence that supports abstitence only projects.... ""Studies That Reported Positive Behavioral Change:Positive behavioral changes were reported in 12 studies of abstinence programs. (See the Appendix and Reference List.) Abstinence-only Intervention. A 2010 study in the medical journal Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, published by the American Medical Association, concludes that an ""abstinence-only intervention reduced sexual initiation"" as well as recent sexual activity among a group of African-American adolescents.[16] Two years after attending an eight-hour abstinence program, about one-third of the participants had initiated sexual activity, compared to nearly one-half of the non-participants who enrolled in a general health program. That is, the abstinence program reduced the rate of sexual initiation by one-third. Moreover, abstinence program participants who became sexually active were not less likely to use contraception.By contrast, the study also evaluated two alternative interventions, one that only taught contraception (i.e., the ""safe sex"" approach) and another that contained both abstinence and contraception content (i.e., comprehensive sex education), and found that neither program delayed or reduced teen sexual activity.[17] Furthermore, these programs, whose main emphasis is on contraception, failed to increase use among adolescents.The study implemented a randomized controlled experiment, the gold standard for such evaluations. Six hundred sixty-two sixth- and seventh-grade African-American students participated in the experiment. These students attended four public middle schools that served low-income communities in a northeastern U.S. city. Students were randomly assigned to attend an eight-hour abstinence-only program, an eight-hour ""safe sex"" program that promoted contraception, an eight- or twelve-hour comprehensive sex education program that taught both abstinence and contraception, or an eight-hour general health class without any sex education content, which served as the control group.Reasons of the Heart. Taught over 20 class periods by certified and program-trained health educators, the Reasons of the Heart (ROH) curriculum focuses on individual character development and teaches adolescents the benefits that are associated with abstinence until marriage."" ""A 2008 study evaluated the ROH curriculum's impact on adolescent sexual activity among seventh grade students in three suburban northern Virginia public schools.[18] The researchers also collected data on a comparison group of seventh grade students in two nearby middle schools that did not participate in the program. Students in those schools instead received the state's standard family life education, which included two videos on HIV/ STD prevention and one on abstinence.The evaluators surveyed seventh grade students in all five schools before and after the program. They found that, a year after the program, 32 (9.2 percent) of the 347 ROH students who were virgins at the initial survey had initiated sexual activity, compared with 31 (or 16.4 percent) of the 189 comparison group students. Controlling for the differences between the comparison group and ROH students,[19] the study reported that ROH students were half as likely as comparison group students to initiate sexual activity.[20] The evaluators concluded, ""This result appears to compare favorably to the reductions in initiation achieved by some of the abstinence programs [evaluated in earlier studies].""[21]Sex Can Wait. Sex Can Wait is a three-series abstinence education program with one series for upper-elementary students, a second for middle school students, and a third for high school students. The Sex Can Wait program lasts five weeks and offers lessons on character building, important life skills, and reproductive biology.A 2006 study evaluated the program's long-term (18-month) impact on adolescent sexual behavior.[22] The researchers compared students who participated in Sex Can Wait to those who received their school districts' standard sex education curricula on two behavioral outcomes: overall abstinence and abstinence during the last 30 days. As the authors noted, ""the study compared the effects of the Sex Can Wait curriculum to 'current practice' rather than true 'control conditions.'""[23]The researchers found that, 18 months after the program, upper-elementary students who participated in Sex Can Wait were less likely than non-participants to report engaging in recent sexual activity. Among middle school students, participants were also less likely than non-participants to report engaging in sexual activity ever and in the preceding month before the 18-month follow-up. Finally, among high school students, the authors found reduced levels of sexual activity in the short term but not in the 18-month follow-up.[24]"" http://www.heritage.org...;I would note to not be like a lot of people out there who don't give credit where it's due.

When separating the sexes critics use the argument that female students need to get the same education as their male counter parts. I say, they will both get better educations if they are separated at a young age to help them both avoid the distractions from the needs of the other. Parents should raise Males and Females differently so why shouldn't we educate them differently too?There are many issues with our educational system, how we teach our young boys in one of those issues. Many young boys, ages 2 until puberty, so between 10-13 years, are much less mature than their female counter parts, but what they lack in maturity they make up in being hyper active beings. Young boys are much more likely to have ""ADD and ADHD"" 2 ""diseases that have been made up because educators do not know how to keep young children, mainly boys calm and attentive in class, young boys are much more likely to face disciplinary issues, more likely to repeat a class and more likely to fall behind. Young boys need more discipline at a young age to help them develop they also need much more activity. Young boys need to learn from their mistakes not punished before they make the mistake. They need to be yelled at and worked hard. Young girls do not need this in their education and with out the distraction of boys causing a riot in class they will be better off than they would in co ed classes. If having co ed classes helps with real world experiences, then having single sex schools, you can teach, boys in general, how to respect others much better, how to be gentleman, how to be better men. Something that only a select few boys can learn outside the home. If there is not male figure in the house, who does the young boy look up to as his male figure? A male teacher? where are those in elementary schools? They look up to gang leaders and drug dealers.

Single-sex education	"For the final round I will make my rebuttals short, as brevity will be my partner in this last exchange. “Another common mistake about children going to same-sex schools is that they only have contact with one sex. This is wrong because...” I never said they’re entirely secluded, but a healthy dosage of the opposite sex only benefits sociability. A limited amount of contact can be detrimental, and your supporting claims are not sufficient. (a) the student have parents which he lives with and interact with them every day That was not what I was referring to when I mentioned communication with the other sex... (b) a boy going to SS school may have a sister or a girl a brother so they would interact with the different sex at home The sibling is not guaranteed to be of the opposite sex, and, even if it is the opposite sex, they may not be able to cooperate. The possibility also exists that a sibling rivalry may be detrimental, as opposed to beneficial. This point remains insignificant, as only children will not benefit from that form of companionship. (c) the student can interact with the other sex doing activities that are not related to the school, like a foreingn(sic) language course or a sport Sports are usually single-sex. I don’t know of a sport that allows members of both sexes to participate with one another. I can understand extracurricular activities; however, the majority are achieved through the school. If the school is single-sex, then the clubs and activities still remain single-sex. (d) a SS school for boys may have women teachers or a SS school for girls men teachers.” Kids rarely interact with teachers. Children, especially at the middle school level, at times have difficulties listening to teachers actually teach, much less strike up a conversation. “ And how SS school has anything to due with the men's divorce? It does not make any sense.” The article does state that men who have been educated at a single-sex possess a higher percentage of divorce. The attributable reason behind this would be the lack of sociability developed from the segregation of sexes. “And in round 3 Con shows a report from the American Council for CoEducational Schooling that break some myths about SS schooling. Of course this report will favor CE schooling! They are the American Council for CoEducational Schooling! Therefore, any argument from this report is invalid due to it's lack of neutrality on the issue.” The two quotes you are referencing, I apologize I remain unable to locate the exact link, but they are from the organization’s website. Anyway, they were acted as an epitome of my stance on single-sex education, not necessarily to reinforce anything I had previously stated. “Con tries to diminish the academic superiority from SS schools stating that they have good scores because they are private. Well, there are CE private schools, so why they do not have better scores than SS private schools? Con`s argument doesn't make any sense.’ My personal argument, in a sense, addresses that “supposed” disparity. My school is nationally accredited, as my source explicitly stated. It is not a single-sex school, yet it is private and coeducational. I do not wish to focus the remainder of my rebuttals on this topic, as I have already presented a counterargument in the previous round. “By far, the advantage most often associated with schooling boys and girls separately is that it eliminates distraction. Freed from the worries of impressing the opposite sex, boys and girls can focus on their books” ""Janice Streitmatter studied and compared the results of girls taking physics in a coeducational and single-sex setting. According to Streitmatter (1998) the girls repeatedly asked the teacher questions and used the answers as opportunities for group learning. As a result of the opportunities for increased participation, achievement also improved. In Streitmatter's findings, in the single-sex physics class 87,5% of the girls made an ‘A’ and 12.5% of the girls made a ‘B’; whereas in the coeducational class only 14.3% of the girls made an ‘A’, 14.3% made a ‘B’, and 71.4% made a ‘C’."" ""By separating the sexes into different classes or schools, the students would be free of distractions from the opposite sex and would be better able to concentrate on academic pursuits."" (3) Distractions would still exist, with or without the opposite sex. Boys can still be distracted boys, and girls can most definitely still be distracted by girls. With respect to the middle paragraph, other factors are present that distinguish who makes an A and who doesn’t. My previous argument addresses this issue, so I will not rehash old information, as this is the final round and would not wish to instigate any new issues as a result. You also did not mention my own personal argument, therefore it still remains as a valid point. In conclusion, I believe coeducational schooling is superior due to the fact that: Single-sex education hinders the development of social interaction between juvenile boys and girls Indicative of the primeval and antiquated system of education that asymmetrically favored males Emotionally detrimental to young males in particular I thank my opponent for a spirited and enjoyable debate.

BushWhile I would regard myself as liberal, myself and Bush and I expect Con share a value in the education system and also for providing the best possible social and working environment for the next generation(s).""THBT Single-Sex Schools are Good for Education.""I don't anticipate that these terms are ambiguous except 'Good for Education', which I will affirm several sub points within this debate.1. Good for academic performance2. Good for education employees3. Good for accommodation of values within educationGiven that no standard of what 'good' would need to fulfil has been provided by Con, I would assume a reasonable starting point would be the standards held up by Co-Educational schools. If we hold that Co-Educational schools are 'Good for Education', then demonstrating that Single Sex Schools are at least as 'good' will win this debate. My opponent would need to either negate all my arguments, or positively demonstrate that single sex-schools are worse for education than co-educational schools (hence demonstrating they are bad for education). Alternatively he is required to attack my presuppositions.Now onto contentions.C1. Single-Sex Schools perform at least on par with co-educational schools academicallyResearch on the effects of single-sex vs. co-educational are notoriously difficult to control for various secondary factors, however a US Dept. Of Education review of 2251 of such studies entitled ""Single-sex versus coeducational schooling: A systematic review"" which concludes:""As in previous reviews, the results are equivocal. There is some support for the premise that single-sex schooling can be helpful, especially for certain outcomes related to academic achievement and more positive academic aspirations. For many outcomes, there is no evidence of either benefit or harm. There is limited support for the view that single-sex schooling may be harmful or that coeducational schooling is more beneficial for students.""Another review mirrored the general findings of the US Dept of Education on general performance, but also found that there was a ""medium advantage in middle school for girls, for both mathematics and science performance"" [ http://www.apa.org...]There are several theoretical points to favoring single sex-education. One such example is sexual stereotypes, which lead to diminished performance of girls in male-dominated disciplines such as maths and science (girls don't want to be seen as 'tomboys' for example). Such a peer-pressure stereotypical effect is absent in single-sex schools.Moreover both male and females have different psychology, hence education can be tailored in a manner which would maximize their learning capacity towards one gender or the other in single sex institutions.[http://www.singlesexschools.org...]C2. Single-Sex Schools accommodate for a spectrum of social valuesIt is no secret that single-sex schools were established in the west for both traditional and religious reasons. Whilst the former is less important in today's society, the latter remains important, especially given that >80% of the US is religious, for example. Several religious sects mandate and value segregated education for boys & girls (amongst other values), and hence single sex schools provide an accommodation for families that hold such values.[http://www.llcsjournal.org...]Moreover, several families value raising their children during their most hormonal and vulnerable stage away from the temptations of the opposite sex, citing potential misgivings such as underage and premarital sex, teenage pregnancy, social pressures, etc.Furthermore, it can be the case that one's child operates better socially and in a learn gin environment with same-sex peers. Hence the child's happiness needs to be valued.ConclusionBy making rather easily defended assumptions, I have demonstrated that single sex schools are good for education. Both the statistics from an overwhelming number of studies, as well as pragmatics and social considerations make my case for me.As such, please vote Pro."

51	S2db4e8f9-A38f576d1	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	"""The minimum legal drinking age should be age 25"""	"I'd like to thank CON for a great debate. O1) Paternalism Principle The government is more rational and better at making decisions than most people. Almost all lawmakers have a college degree. Congressmen have consultants to help them understand technical details. Lawmakers debate extensively using scientific research. Lawmakers have the time to analyze risk and reward. The average person does not. Therefore the paternalism principle has merits. We are not designed to ‘analyze risk over reward for every action'. Con has the BOP to show otherwise. Adults under 25 are especially bad at this task [1]. We are designed to survive in prehistoric times, not modern times with automobiles, weapons, and drugs. Con also uses a slippery slope fallacy to state that ‘why not the government regulate our every move?' It is better to learn from one's mistake as long as the mistakes will not cause serious permanent damage. Con's examples do not fit into this category. Consuming large amounts of alcohol does. If Con truly believes in the libertarian ethics, would he allow all drugs and banish the FDA? Should school not be compulsory? a) War on Drugs Drugs are still illegal in Portugal just decriminalized. Drug trafficking is still a criminal offense, and possession is still fined. [2] Con states ""16% have used cocaine."" The key word is ""used"" not ""active users"". If one takes that into account, the number is only 2%[3] This is a much smaller number than when cocaine was used widespread[4], demonstrating the success that the war on drugs has had. Con states that ""even if Pro can prove that paternalism worked, that doesn't justify the principle's use."" Pro has made a positive affirmation without backing up his claim. How is it unjustified? b) Seatbelts Seatbelt laws are effective. 80% of Americans using a seatbelt is a great number! People still commit murders even though it is illegal. That does not mean murder should be legal. c) Helmets Con's source proves nothing. The study didn't even apply to motorcyclist. Motorcyclists are required to wear helmets in laws in some states, not bicyclist. According to an article in the Journal of Medical Associations: ""Head injury death rates based on motorcycle registrations were also lowest in states with comprehensive helmet-use laws.""[5] O2) Brain development Unless Con can debunk the study I presented, it is a safer bet for the minimum drinking age to be 25, not 21. Your source says nothing about neurons not forming, just the distance between connections. It's a very hasty assumption to assume that means the brain does not mature. C1) Alcohol impedes brain development Often if people drink, they drink more than moderation. Both personal experience and evidence demonstrates this. Still, even moderate drinking causes brain shrinkage [6]. C2) Other harms Adolescents are still below the age of 25 so my sources still stand. C3) Alcohol harms others The source I cited states in its conclusion: ""Compared with a wide range of other programs and efforts to reduce drinking among teenagers, increasing the legal age for purchase and consumption of alcohol to 21 appears to have been the most successful effort to date""[7] The issue of drunk driving is associated with alcohol consumption, since one need to consume alcohol in order to drink and drive. This is the same logic of why enriched uranium and dangerous chemical possessions are regulated. Con states there is a difference since they can only be used for weapons. This statement is false. Enriched uranium can be used for energy. Perhaps a person could be a rare metal collector. Many dangerous chemicals are regulated even if they are not used for dangerous purposes. For example, special transportation needs to be considered for chemicals that are hazardous or explosive. The fact remains that drunk driving is a problem since one cannot voluntarily become sober. This is why it is treated differently from other issues as reading and driving, which is far less common. The best way to stop this would be to stop the drinking in the first place. It would be impractical to get rid of the car, since it is necessary for transportation. Drinking is unnecessary. C4) Alcohol related crimes 60% of all homicides are attributed to alcohol.[8] Imagine how many lives could be saved if the minimization law was 25. Even if this might ‘unfairly punish' some people, these people can wait until there 25 until they can drink. Many of our laws restrict certain age groups in participating in certain activities (ex: driving, voting, sex, etc.) based on statistics conducted on these age groups. Why should alcohol be any different? ==Rebuttal== R1) Con drops this case R2) Social lives There are alternative places for social gathering. Entertainment, mall, doing an activity (ex: golfing, paintballing, etc.), restaurants, etc. There are clubs that allow people under 21 to enter. I know from personal experience. With the demand to be social, businesses will create settings for social gatherings for people under 25. People rarely drink in moderation in social gatherings and I have shown above that drinking even in moderation is unhealthy. Con does not address that people under 21 also have social lives despite a minimization law already in place. R3) Career Opportunities I am correct that those of age 25 are unlikely to enter into a prestigious business deal. The average age of a CEO is 50[9]. Considering that it takes an average of 28 years to become a CEO, it seems very unlikely for someone with only a few years of professional experience will get involved in important business deals. Con states that business deals are domestic. Businesses are increasingly global [10] If the economic could progress during the times of prohibition, the positive effect on alcohol in business is minimal. This article shows how to build business relations. There is not one mention of alcohol [11]. R4) criminal justice or public health? I've shown ample evidence that making an act illegal is not only effective, but more effective then public health campaigns. R5) calling for help There are people who do not call for help. However, this number is still low. This point is moot unless Con proves that more lives are lost by people not calling for help than the amount of lives saved by the minimal drinking age law of 1984. I've shown, through plummeting drunk driving, minimum drinking age laws has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. R6) Risky behavior Binge drinking increases after the age of 21. My source states ""Rates of binge alcohol use in 2007 were 1.5 percent among 12 or 13 year olds, 7.8 percent among 14 or 15 year olds, 19.4 percent among 16 or 17 year olds, 35.7 percent among persons aged 18 to 20, and peaked among those aged 21 to 25 at 45.9 percent""[12] R7) No refute against claim that ""rights can bet taken away if pose threat to oneself and others"". Everyone is better off, and the resolution would result in diminished harm. Even if one disagrees with the parental principle, one at least agrees that the government has the right to protect others from harm, based on social contract theory. Conclusion: Almost all of my sources are peer reviewed journal that use the scientific methods as opposed to my opponent who uses mainly anecdotal and opinions. I have shown how the parental principle is effective in saving lives. Many people unnecessarily die at the hand of alcohol. This resolution could save many lives. Any benefit alcohol has is minimal compared to the unnecessary destruction it causes. http://tinyurl.com...[1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com...

Teens should be allowed to have sex	"Your argument is that teens should have sex because they know how to use a condom, ""magic pill"", etc. I will give 3 reasons why teens, shouldn't be allowed to have sex. 1.Sex Ed-Your proposing for teenagers to have sex in today's current system. Today's current system has terrible sex ed in many red states. States such as Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, etc. have little if any sex education classes. Not every teen has good access to significant sexual education. The vast majority of state-based sex education programs ignore science, do not require information about HIV or other STIs, and ignore the LGBTQ+ population Tufts University School of Medicine 2-14-2014, ""Biased Sex Education in the United States,"" No Publication, https://sites.tufts.edu... Each state has its own policies about sex education in schools. Although the American Medical Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both recommend that all students receive a comprehensive sex education, including information about how to prevent STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Only 22 states and the District of Columbia mandate that schools provide sex education. In many states, the type of information that can be taught is biased with 17 not requiring instruction about HIV/AIDS; 19 requiring that information taught in sex education classes be medical, factually, or technically accurate; and eight have ""no promo homo"" laws which either prohibit gay-inclusive or sexual-orientation-neutral instruction or require that teachers provide anti-gay instruction. Currently, 27 states require an emphasis on an abstinence-only approach to preventing pregnancy. The schools can discuss other birth control methods but must stress that abstinence is the main method of protection. Abstinence may be the best way to prevent pregnancy, but abstinence-only education programs have been shown to be ineffective. Instead, they may deter teenagers from using contraceptives. Studies have shown that students who receive comprehensive education are 60% less likely to become pregnant or get someone else pregnant. Teen pregnancy rates in 2013 were highest in Mississippi and Arkansas, and both states have an abstinence-only education. The young women in these states are prone to experience the other consequences and health risks of teenage pregnancy, such as a higher likelihood of living in poverty or being in poor health. Their children have an increased risk of having health or cognitive disadvantages, and many become teen parents as well. Additionally, schools with abstinence-only education do not provide information for STD prevention. Often, students are not instructed about preventive methods, such as using condoms or receiving HPV vaccinations. This can lead to a higher risk of contracting and/or spreading STDs, including HIV/AIDS. In 41 states and the District of Columbia, schools that teach sex education are not required to teach medically accurate information. They are allowed to- and often encouraged to- provide statistics that inflate the failure rate of contraceptives or emphasize only the risks of abortion. Exploiting the possible ineffectiveness of contraceptives can have devastating effects. Students who choose to engage in sexual activity may decide not to use protection, believing it will not make a difference. Without using protection, they can risk both pregnancy and contracting STDs. Teaching inaccurate information also sets a dangerous precedent for future health instruction. This piece of evidence shows that sex education is a failure, inconsistent and downright discriminatory to the LGBTQ+ population. 2.Laws-How sex and age work according to laws now is the age of consent. The age of consent allows for anyone above that line to have sex. In Texas, it's 17. This allows anyone 17 or older to legally sleep with anyone 17 or older. Since you want to allow ALL teenagers to have sex, that means a 43-year-old male teacher can have legal sex with a 13-year-old girl. If you don't find anything disturbing or wrong with this, then hopefully the judges can find the moral line you can't. 3.LGBTQ-As shown earlier, LGBTQ populations don't get good coverage of sex ed and is missed as a topic. This shows that until we allow ALL people to be covered, then we need to make sure that no one is going to make mistakes they don't have the knowledge to take care of."

51	S11b834b9-Aa9a7cef5	1	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	THBT sex education must be taught in High School students in the Philippines	What is sex education? Sex education is a broad term used to describe education about human sexual anatomy, sexual reproduction, sexual intercourse, and other aspects of human sexual behavior. Common avenues for sex education are parents or caregivers, school programs, and public health campaigns. Education about reproduction typically describes the creation and development of a new human being, from conception and the development of the embryo and fetus, through to childbirth. It often includes topics such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and how to avoid them, as well as birth control methods. Why sex education? Although some form of sex education is part of the curriculum at many schools, it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, and topics dealing with human sexuality and behavior (eg. safe sex practices, masturbation and sexual ethics). In many countries, sexual education raises much contentious debate. Chief among the controversial points is whether covering child sexuality is valuable or detrimental; the use of birth control such as condoms and hormonal contraception. Increasing support for abstinence-only sex education by conservative groups has been one of the primary causes of this controversy. Countries with conservative attitudes towards sex education (including the UK and the U.S.) have a higher incidence of STIs and teenage pregnancy. Why in the Philippines and why high school students? It is a great issue in the Philippines because some say that students in high schools are to young to know about sex education. Elementary years are for childish things while in college is for maturity stage while in high school, they are easily taught, and they are curious, so, I chose high schools students Parameters: The parameter of this debate is that only to 3rd years and 4th years are to be allowed in knowing this kind of subject That will be all for now..

51	Saff75a5f-A6bfabf18	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Coeducational schools are better than single-sex ones	"Hello there, I believe single-sex schools are far more effective at providing education than mixed schools. Personally, I went to a single-sex school myself and benefitted enormously from it, but my experience is also backed up by lots of research suggesting that both genders simply have different needs in education. It's true that one day, both sexes will need to work and cooperate well together in life and the workplace, but attending a single-sex school doesn't mean you won't be able to do this. The main reason to attend school is for education, especially in subjects that you are passionate about. Half of all mixed schools have no girls doing A-level physics. This can't be because girls just do not like physics. Instead, it's that there is pressure to behave in a ""Manly"" or ""feminine"" way at mixed schools, resulting in pupils not taking subjects they want to do so that they conform to this social rule. At a group of single-sex schools, girls are more than twice as likely to take physics than girls nationally, surely you will agree that we can not stop young students from studying subjects they love? When I was at school, there was plenty of opportunities to socialise with the other sex. Whether it was in school plays, parties, or simply getting the buses and trains on the way home. Single-sex schools don't create a barrier between sexes socially; they just allow both sexes to learn separately as their learning needs are very different. On your last point, what evidence is there to suggest that mixed schools are more gentle, happy and inclusive? Personally, I think that in mixed schools, some boys behave obnoxiously in front of girls in an attempt to impress them, which certainly wouldn't create a more gentle place."

Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S878e2e96-A3c42616b	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single Sex Schools Are Good for Education.	"As this debate is based on whether Single Sex schools are good for education, I do not have to prove that Single Sex schools are better, only that they are in some ways good for education. ""Some parents don't want their children to be in mixed-gender classrooms because, especially at certain ages, students of the opposite sex can be a distraction. Leonard Sax and others agree that merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little. But single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students. Some research indicates that girls learn better when classroom temperature is warm, while boys perform better in cooler classrooms. If that's true, then the temperature in a single-sex classroom could be set to optimize the learning of either male or female students. Some research and reports from educators suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both girls and boys. Advocates claim co-ed schools tend to reinforce gender stereotypes, while single-sex schools can break down gender stereotypes. For example, girls are free of the pressure to compete with boys in male-dominated subjects such as math and science. Boys, on the other hand, can more easily pursue traditionally ""feminine"" interests such as music and poetry. One mother, whose daughter has attended a girls-only school for three years, shares her experience on the GreatSchools parent community: ""I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise."" Federal law supports the option of single-sex education. In 2006, Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations, allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools, as long as such options are completely voluntary. This move gives parents and school districts greater flexibility."" [1] These are some arguments from the website listed below. [1] http://www.greatschools.org..."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	Se69d093e-A7e1475ac	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Homosexual sex is more harmful than heterosexual sex	"1. Pro says that gay men have anal sex more often, thus are at greater risk for anal problems. Two issues with this. First, I've already pointed out that lesbians are half the homosexual population (and they don't have anal sex). So if we combine lesbians with gay men, then on balance, gay and straight people have about the same amount of anal sex, therefore this ratio would be negated. Second, Pro has not proven that gay sex is more harmful; he's proven that anal sex can be harmful - but is not always. Not all gay sex includes anal sex. Gay men engage in other sexual acts. Further, Pro's argument is that having more anal sex = more potential for harm, NOT that gay sex is more harmful. After all, if a gay or lesbian couple never had anal sex, or had it less often than a straight couple, it wouldn't be the gay sex that was harmful, but the frequency of anal sex which is not based on sexuality. 2. I pointed out that STIs can largely be prevented by condoms. Pro says that many gay men don't use condoms. Ergo, Pro is arguing that irresponsible sex is dangerous, NOT gay sex. If you have a lot of sexual partners without protection, that is dangerous regardless of sexuality. However the resolution is not ""Gay men are more promiscuous"" or ""Gay men have more anal sex"" which are both true. Instead the resolution is simply about gay vs. straight sex, and there's no reason to assume that gay sex automatically equals sex without protection. This could easily be ratified by more gay people using protection, so it is not inherent to homosexuality. My opponent claims that gays have higher STD rates because they are forced to have anal and oral sex. I've already explained that lesbians do not have high rates of STDs and account for 1/2 of the homosexual population. Still, the reason gay men have high rates of STDs is because they do not fear pregnancy, so tend to be more careless when it comes to protection. This is not based on one's sexuality though but their own preferences on caution. To clarify, Pro's source by the CDC does NOT say that gay sex is the riskiest way to get AIDS. The link says that by demographic, gay men have the highest rate of AIDS. Once again (this is my main argument in this debate) just because more gay men have AIDS than straight men, on balance, does not mean that gay sex itself is the problem. Unsafe sex is the problem. Pro says ""It's too bad more gays don't use protection,"" which admits that if using protection, the risk factor becomes negligible between straight and gay sex. 3. My opponent has argued that BV (bacterial vaginosis) occurs more in lesbians. The source he posts admits, ""The reason for this is unknown."" If the reason for this is unknown, then Pro cannot attribute the reason to gay sex.Pro has tried to say that lesbians might have more bacterial vaginosis than straight women on balance (although the link also included BISEXUAL women, who also have sex with men...). First, BV is one of the most benign diseases you can get and many do not qualify it as an STD at all [1]. In fact, BV has been found in virgins who have never had sex. It can be sexually transmitted, but it doesn't have to be, so this statistic is moot because the reason for BV cannot be pinned on sex. Second, the studies that show this have been demonstrated to use horrible sampling for their data, and those results have been largely discredited among peer review anyway [2, 3]. Pro has failed to mention straight women have more herpes, HPV, crabs, gonorrhea, syphilis and AIDS than lesbians. There are two reasons for this. One, penises make it easier to spread disease. Pro contests this, but more about that in a second. Second, lesbians tend to be in monogamous and long-term relationships compared to their heterosexual peers [4]; in other words they have less sexual partners. While gay men tend to be promiscuous, lesbians tend to be the opposite. That's essentially why I accepted this debate: to demonstrate that conservatives fraudulently suggest ""gay sex"" is dangerous which isn't true. Unsafe sex is dangerous, and half the gay population (lesbians) are not sleeping around or acquiring high rates of disease [5].It's very common knowledge that lesbians have significantly less sex than gay men [6]. For Pro to discount half of the homosexual population in this debate would be dishonest. 4. Pro claims that lesbians have more STDs and more sex with men than straight women which is absurd. Just because sexuality is fluid and some lesbians enjoy sex with men (some straight women enjoy sex with women) doesn't mean that on balance, lesbians have more sex with men. While Pro cites the page of a book that none of us have access to, I took the liberty of Googling the source. It came up on ""conversion therapy"" sites for homophobic Christians such as factsaboutyouth.com [7]. In other words, I will assume the research is problematic and heavily biased, but here's an even more important point: Pro claims the fact that lesbians ""have more sex with men"" puts them at greater risk. But why would that put them at greater risk, unless Pro concedes that penises make it easy to spread disease? Pro cannot have both. He either has to concede that it's easier to spread disease through penises, or drop the point that ""lesbians have more sex with men"" (which hasn't been conclusively proven) because if penises aren't an issue, then this doesn't matter and it's a moot point. 5. Pro claims that only 600 women die from pregnancy each year in the U.S. It's very convenient for Pro to limit this discussion to the U.S. with all of our western medical advances. Unfortunately the global statistics do not yield such a pretty picture. Over 303,000 women died from pregnancy complications last year [7]. It's not looking so great in the U.S. either. Whereas 7.2 women died per 100,000 births in 1987, that number swelled to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2009 and 2011 [8]. More than 800 women die every day from pregnancy or childbirth related causes [9]. The majority of sexually transmitted diseases do not kill you [10] therefore the number of people who die from pregnancy/childbirth every year FAR outnumbers the amount of people who die from STDs (whom are not all gay). Ergo, pregnancy is more dangerous than STDs and pregnancy can only result from heterosexual sex - not homosexual sex. Most STDs are treatable and many are curable. Conclusion Science doesn't support the argument that gay sex causes disease. It does support the argument that unsafe sex causes disease. Unsafe sex is not limited or inherently related to one particular sexuality. If you have safe gay sex, you'll be fine. If you have unsafe straight sex, you might not be fine. Both gay and straight people can have the same amount of sex and the same type of sex (anal, oral, etc.). Responsible people will be safe whereas irresponsible people will be endangered. Websites that talk about how to prevent STDs do not say to inhibit gay sex - they say to practice safe sex, regardless of type [10]. Lesbians make up 1/2 the gay population and have safer sex habits (less partners, less possibility of transmission). Numbers show that lesbians have less STDs. Nevertheless, STDs are mostly curable and treatable whereas pregnancy and childbirth can kill you. More people die from things related to heterosexuality (pregnancy) each year than gay sex.

51	S2c813efa-A97c94a4	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	The user known as Danielle used dishonest tactics in her same-sex parenting debate.	"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S861da101-A172870e1	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single-sex education	"1- Students from single-sex schools are better academically than mixed-sex schoolsThe first reason for that is the environment in which students are inserted. A study made by two professors, Lea Hubbard (University of San Diego) and Amanda Datnow (University of Southern California), entitled ""Do Single-Sex Schools Improve the Education of Low-Income and Minority Students? An Investigation of California's Public Single-Gender Academies"" shows the students opinions relative to the single sex school environment. A boy stated:""When there's girls in here, there's gonna be less learning and, you know, there's gonna be more distractions' cause, look, when I'm sitting right here... and a fine girl walks in, then I'm gonna turn around and start messing with them.""(1)The teachers also noticed how the students behaved differently in the setting:""Several teachers also commented that the setting made certain actions unlikely. When boys did not have girls present, they felt less need to show off, act out, or engage in attention-getting behavior. Likewise, girls who did not have boys present did not have to vie for their attention. Instead of competing with each other, girls learned to work collaboratively, bond as friends, and became more focused on their academic work.""(2)My point is, without the presence of the opposite sex, students are more able to concentrate on their academics. Another study that supports my argument is ""Single-sex versus coeducational schooling: A systematic review"", made by the US department of Education. It has researches from all over the world about single sex/cooed education. On All-Subject Achievement Test Scores, which ""have been defined as scores indicating the composite mastery of specific skills or scholastic content areas (i.e., mathematics, verbal, science, etc.) acquired over a restricted span of time"", shows that, of the nine studies examined, six reported results supporting single sex schools while only one reported results supporting coeducational schools.(I was not able to copy/paste the tables from this study. Please understand and forgive me.)Other subject is Self-Concept, which can be defined as “the totality of a complex, organized, and dynamic system of learned beliefs, attitudes and opinions that each person holds to be true about his or her personal existence”. Of seven studies, 4 reported results favoring single-sex schooling and the other 3 reported null results(indifferent). That means that SS schools have a better environment which favours the intellectuality of their students.(3)The study also shows that it is less likely to people who went to SS schools to be unemployed. Because of the better academics they will be the best professionals to be hired and hardly will be unemployed. Even though there were a lot of null results in this study, the results favoring single-sex educational were in most cases higher than the favoring coeducation.2- Students from single-sex schools don't have any sociability problemAgain I will use the same studies from the past argument and state that the environment whereupon the students are inserted does not cause any problem. In my preview argument, I showed teachers from a study stating that the environment from single sex schools was beneficial for both girls and boys academically and socially. Although some researches favours CE schools on Self-Esteem, the US department studies also shows that SS schools students have higher Educational and Career Aspirations. This shows, at some, point, that students from SS schools have a high self-esteem. They know they can be at the top of their careers, they know they can be the best, and most of all, they want it. (3)The study shows other researches showing that Delinquency is lower on SS school students. This does not mean that CE schools student are more delinquent than SS, just shows that they have an environment less favourable to develop a delinquent. As stated before, the lack of the opposite sex favours friendship over competition between the classmates. Boys won't be fighting for a girls won't be doing crazy things for a boy's love. (3)Girls in SS schools recognize better their role in society as Working Women than girls in CE schools. And the result for boys is the same, both for SS and CE schools. This ends the myth about the machismo in SS boy schools.(3)One research also showed that CE girls are more likely to have Eating Disorders. CE school girls need to be ""hot"" for their male classmates and sometimes they think their is a necessity to be thiner, while in SS girl schools don't have this problem.(3)Another research from the study also shows that girls from SS schools statistically choose College Majors which are gender-mixed rather than predominantly female more than girls CE schools.(3)On Sex role Stereotyping on girls only, one study favoured SS schooling and the other one favoured CE schooling, showing that NO, SS schooling does not creates in the students mind a stereotype for their work environment.(3) The other study showed how girls felt more comfortable in a SS school than in a CE school. An interesting point of view was this one:""You can come like in the morning.. and you don't have to put like make up on because we're girls and if there were guys here...[We would be thinking],'Oh my god, I can't go like this.""(4)This comproves that social stereotypes, especially with women, are less likely to happen in SS schools than in CE schools. 3- Personal argumentAs I stated in round 1, I study in a SS school. There is no problem at all with me or with my friends. We don't stereotype women, some of my friends have or had girlfriends, and it has a different climate or environment from the one in CE schools. This was the first school I felt I fitted in. An only male or female environment makes it easier for you to bond with other people, to make new friends. And academically, my school is considered the best one in Brazil(I'm Brazilian).(5)Sources:1http://www.jstor.org...2 idem3 http://files.eric.ed.gov...4http://www.jstor.org...5 http://en.wikipedia.org..."

51	Sc2472cfa-A3bbfab9	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	It's bad when Children sexually experimenting on each other.	Personally i don't see the problem with children sexually experiment on each other. I think most children would do it if they were not hold back by grown ups. When i was young and probably many others here can relate to my story, i had some sexual desires and i experimented with a girl at the same age as me. I was probably about 6 years old. I felt really bad at that time, because i felt there was something wrong with me because grown ups made me believe that me having sexual desires was not normal and sex was some taboo that i should not be exposed to . Now when i have grown up, i can reflect on my experience and i know that there was nothing wrong with me. Most kids go through something similar. I don't think it is healthy for kids to go through this. I also think painting sex as some kind of taboo to our kids makes those kids grow up always feeling in some way that sex is something to be ashamed of. They start calling each other sluts for having to much sex, telling each other sex should only be to procreate, make fun of people for having some kinky sex. in other words, i think a lot of our social problems come because we aren't honest to kids about sex, we hide it and talk around it. We confuse them and often they stay confused and ashamed.	CON	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S8be2b95f-A88ec9e30	1	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex Education Should Be Taught In Schools	"Thank you. Here's my rebuttal to my opponent's argument. First of all, my opponent only wrote one sentence and it's a bare assertion. He doesn't provide any evidence saying that kids are better taught by their parents than schools or that schools are insufficient in teachings sexual education. With no sources or logic applied to this argument, it can easily be thrown out, but I'll go even deeper into it to prove my point. Not all children have parents, that's clear.""It is estimated there are between 143 million and 210 million orphans worldwide (recent UNICEF report.) The UNICEF orphan numbers DON’T include abandonment (millions of children) as well as sold and/or trafficked children. The current population of the United States is just a little over 300 million…"" [1]Those children can't be taught sexual education by their parents. What about children who are abused or neglected by their parents? ""...there were nearly 27,000 reports of child abuse and neglect in Pennsylvania in 2013 and about 22,500 Pennsylvania children lived in foster care in 2014."" [2] This is in Pennsylvania alone. What about on a larger scale?""According to NCANDS whose latest statistics are for 2005 an estimated 3.3 million referrals of child abuse or neglect were received by public social service or CPS agencies. Of these referrals, 899,000 children were confirmed to be victims of abuse or neglect (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007). That means about 12 out of every 1,000 children up to age 18 in the United States were found to be victims of maltreatment in 2005 (USDHHS, 2007)."" [3]Would these parents be qualified/willing to teach their children about sexual education? Most parents aren't qualified to teach the way a licensed teacher hired by a school can, unless, of course, they're teachers themselves. Thirdly, let's say that every single child in the world had parents who are actually somewhat capable of teaching their child. In this fantasy land, they're actually decent parents who properly take care of their child efficiently without abuse or anything like that. But there's one thing that isn't certain: if they're putting in the time. In a school environment, you can ensure that every child is being focused on and they all get an equal amount of education and time. In a home environment, you can't exactly make sure of this. Thank you. I look forward to my opponent's defense.Citations[1]http://www.orphanhopeintl.org...[2]http://www.papartnerships.org...[3]http://www.americanhumane.org..."

Therefore, I am only go to provide the titles of my arguments and will not go into much detail to allow my opponent a chance to redeem himself next round. Thank you for this debate. Hopefully, you come back next round! Also, Con did not say who had the BoP. I assume Con must prove that single-sex schools are not beneficial OR mixed gender schools are better. Then, I as Pro must prove that there are benefits of single-sex schools. ArgumentsTwo subpoints fall under my first point here. FocusStudent FocusStudents will focus on more important things such as their education, thus these students will have a greater chance to a better future. Focused CurriculumTeachers have the option to alter certain aspects of the curriculum or their teaching method to create a better relation between the student and what he/she is learning. Two more subpoints fall under my second main point.School EnvironmentLoss of Gender StereotypesSingle-sex school environments allow male and female students to pursue careers in fields that are usually dominated by members of the opposite sex. More Relaxed SchoolingThis is sort of tied in with my focus point. There are generally fewer cliques and there is less pressure on students socially to act certain ways; therefore, students can be themselves. My two main points, focus and schooling environment will be elaborated in the next round. I will ask kindly for my opponent to not refute anything I said in this round (though I'm not sure how much you could really refute right away :P) as I did not get a chance to rebuttal any of your arguments.Thank you!Good luck in the rounds to follow!

51	S861da101-Aa6a6176a	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single-sex education	"Single-sex education hinders the development of social interaction between juvenile boys and girls During the developmental years of the average teenager, intergender interactions are a necessity. Not only for gradual progression into a sociable individual, but also for achieving the happiness that accompanies a healthy relationship. As with most abilities, it will be easier to develop knowledge of the other sex at a young age. By segregating the two sexes into opposing institutions, the children are deprived of the opportunity to interact with the other sex on a regular basis. The result of this is unfamiliarity. Men and women are forced to gain understanding and knowledge concerning how to converse with the other sex later in life. By that point, they have have been thrust into a scenario, say a workplace, where collaboration between sexes is required. Unfamiliarity is a therefore a hinderance. Dr. Alan Smithers, a respected British schools expert and the professor of Education at Buckingham University, declared in a 2006 report that “distraction by boys was a myth’ and that ‘half a century of research has not shown any dramatic or consistent advantages for single-sex education for boys or girls.”[1] “In Hong Kong, where 10 per cent of schools are single-sex, girls appeared to do better. But in Belgium, where co-educational schools are in the minority, boys and girls who study together get the best results. He highlighted the fact that 40 per cent of people who had a single-sex education wanted their children to go to a co-educational school.”[1] The above three quotes highlight another point that I am attempting to make. Not only do they hinder growth with respect to social skills; they also do not create a more effective and conducive learning environment. The number of single-sex state schools has fallen from nearly 2,500 to just over 400 in 40 years. In Scotland co-educational schools that separated students into single-sex classes did not improve the success rates of the boys.[1] Fundamental differences exist in both sexes. Girls typically focus better, while boys desire change more frequently. While girls may achieve greater educational success; they do not attain any skills with boys. While boys typically suffer in a single-sex environment, they also lose the ability to gain an understanding of girls. Indicative of the primeval and antiquated system of education that asymmetrically favored males Previous centuries and civilizations predominantly favored men. Education was a premium that only the wealthy could afford. Aristocrats and the nobility placed their boys into the most fortunate position available in order for the family lineage to continue down the path of wealth and prestige. By segregating genders, one runs the risk of devaluing the education of either boys or girls due to the differences in the education received. The classes that are taught best in a single-sex environment can be easily integrated into a co-educational system. By separating genders, the schooling each one receives isn’t guaranteed to be same, as it would be if both were incorporated. I’m currently unable to access the source I used to obtain the above information. I will provide the source and extra, more specific information in the next round. ""We know from the history of our country that separate is not equal,"" said Liben. ""There's no reason to divide along the lines of biological sex.""[3] Title 9 of the U.S. Education Amendments prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in institutions that are federally funded. The above quote remains specifically applicable to the United States. Classes such as home economics and metal shop are typically single-sex in nature; however continuing single-sex education in this form directly violates this statute.[3] Emotionally detrimental to young males in particular Men are at an extreme disadvantage when placed in a single-sex environment. Past experiments and research have shown that males struggle academically in an all-male system. They are more prone to gender stereotypes as a result of unfamiliarity with the opposite sex; therefore, no females would exist to abolish the stereotype. Thus the misconception perpetuates itself.[3] “The report also cited a 2010 study which compared two preschool classes. In one class, the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children. The other teacher did not. After just two weeks, the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex. The kids also showed an increase in gender-specific stereotypes (i.e. boys played with trucks, girls with dolls).”[3] The above quote exemplifies points 1 and 3. Not only do young children learn less information, they also don’t operate as well with the opposite sex than they would in a co-educational setting. Lynn Liben, professor of psychology and education at Penn State and co-author of the study conducted. The third and fourth statements below are excerpts from the report. men educated in single-sex schools are more likely to “face divorce and depression by their early 40s.”[2] “boys brought up in a single-sex environment are less able to relate to the oppositesex than those taught in a co-educational school.”[2] ""There's really no good evidence that single-sex schools are in any way academically superior, but there is evidence of a negative impact,""[3] ""Kids' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited, and there could be long-term consequences where, for example, girls are used to being in roles only among other girls, then they have to face the real world where that's not the case."" [3] The above applies to not just boys, but also to girls. It also correlates with point 1. The emotional and social aspects of children are not properly developed and, in conjunction with that pitfall, the children do not receive a substantially better education. Men are at the greatest disadvantage as the above quote referring to divorce and depression elucidates explicitly. Unfamiliarity again reappears in the second quote from the second source. Indeed it appears boys suffer significantly worse than girls. Sources [1]http://www.theguardian.com... [2]http://www.care2.com... [3]http://abcnews.go.com... That concludes my arguments for the time being. I look forward to hearing my opponent’s contentions and subsequent rebuttals. I look forward to a fruitful discussion.

51	Se193035b-Ab86655e4	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Resolution: Single-Gender classrooms would improve the quality of education in American publicschool	"History: ""it existed in the 18th century before coeducation started to trend in the 19th century. However, it picked up steam in the late ""90s, especially when the Supreme Court made a ruling in the United States v. Virginia case involving male-only military college Virginia Military Institute. The conclusion: Single-sex classrooms were only constitutional if comparable resources were available to both genders. In 2006, the No Child Left Behind Act added a provision giving single-sex classrooms and schools the ability to exist as long as they are voluntary. From 1995 to 2006, the number of single-sex schools in the United States rose from 3 to 241"" (5) there are many proven benefits to single gender classrooms. It is because of this reasoning we agree with the resolution. Case 1: Proven Intellectual Benefits In Single Sex Schools Students have shown benefit when participating in single sex schools. For instance, look at the difference between single gender school and public school! (1)Not you: Put the date it was taken.

""It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education. Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science, meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men. Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work, there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments."" Ash: A misconseption, people like to use that excuse for a way to get a way out of work, also if you take a look at boys in america you""d find that they could care less about school. Therefore the dates DOES matter. The data is useless if it can""t be backed up End quote. Here is yet another graph, (2) supporting the benefits of single-gender schooling. As you can see from this graph, the percentage of male proficient students in Co-Ed compared to the percentage of males from single-sex schools, double in single-sex schools. Here is a quote from the article. "" In a research study, done in London, it was shown that single sex male schools allow young men and boys to express their emotional side better than co-ed schools. Boys are more likely to move towards art, along with dance and music, instead of simply conforming to the stereotypes that are perceived in co-ed school districts. Also, in single-sex schools, classes are more structured towards the males"" learning style, rather than having to work with both genders (Williams). not you:In this society boys do not go to art often. A study actually showed that diff. genders dont learn diff. sexist. End quote. A quote from my third source, addresses a research study done in London. (3) Case 2: Advantages of Single-Sex Schools According to long term studies of children from around the world, students achieve more and learn better in single sex schools. (3) ""An Australian study of 270,000 students found that both boys and girls performed significantly higher on standardized tests when they attended separate schools. During an experiment in Virginia in 1995, 100 eighth graders were separated just for math and science courses. Almost immediately, the girls began to achieve more, become more confident and participate more often in class.In 2001, a British study conclude that nearly every girl regardless of her ability or socioeconomic status performed better in single sex classrooms than co-ed ones. The study of study of 2954 high schools and 979 primary schools showed that while boys at the lowest ends academically improved the most in single sex schools, single sex education was particularly beneficial to girls. Every one of the top fifty elementary schools and top twenty high schools in Britain are single sex schools in britain discibplain is a must, this is america land of the mcdonalds. we don""t teach as Ash: People in Britain are more disciplined than in America.well than britain.When rating their computer skills, 36% of graduates of independent girls"" schools consider themselves strong students, compared to 26% of their co-ed peers. 48% of girls"" school alumnae rate themselves great at math versus 37% for girls in co-ed schools. Three times as many alumnae of single-sex schools plan to become engineers. . "" End quote Gender inequality and differences There are many differences between boys and girls. This source supports this. Boys have a higher physical activity level and develop self-control later than girls. Girls seem to show stronger verbal skills and demonstrate empathy more readily than boys. Knowing that: In general, boys seem to be more successful with increased structure. For instance, one of the best ways to provide instructions for boys is to list directions in bullet format on the board and provide a time frame for completing all steps, or even each step. In this way, teachers can also define specifically how they want students to prepare for tests. Boys will typically only read over their notes or the textbook as preparation, sometimes the morning of the test. Requiring specific steps""such as making vocabulary flash cards the first night, sketching key concepts the second night, and making their own questions the third night""in studying for a test provides clearer expectations and directs students to prepare appropriately. After several months of setting study expectations, teachers could then make a transition to requiring exit slips, in which students explain how they will prepare for the test as they leave class. Again, this provides more structure in which students take ownership and can be held accountable. On the other hand, girls tend to benefit from increased opportunities for making connections between themselves and the content. To tap this, teachers could build in more cycles where students voice their opinion about content, make comparisons between content and their own experience, and use manipulatives or real objects to explore concepts. The facts: In mathematics, 14 schools showed higher achievement for single-gender girls than coed girls, and in only 3 schools did coed girls achieve higher than their counterparts in single-gender classes. For boys, 13 schools showed higher achievement for single-gender than coed; 5 schools showed the reverse. In reading and language arts, 14 schools indicated that single-gender girls outperformed coed girls; 3 schools indicated the reverse. For boys, 11 schools said that single-gender classes outperformed coed classes; 7 schools showed the reverse. In the area of discipline, 7 of the 10 schools submitting data indicated that single-gender classes had a lower number of discipline referrals than coed classes. More data supporting the position: (5) ""Jefferson Leadership Academies was in the spotlight in 1999 when it became the first public middle school in the United States to have entirely single-gender classes. Its reason? Research showed that girls did better in math and science in all-girl settings. This decision came just a few years after Failing at Fairness: How Our Schools Cheat Girls was published by two American University professors.""Ash: research showed that recently genders dont learn diff. ""It eliminates gender stereotypes. When single gender classrooms are available, boys and girls tend to follow personal pursuits that interest them instead of trying to fit into specific stereotypes. Boys, for example, might pursue poetry. Girls tend to stop trying to focus on the goal of ""keeping up with the boys"" and instead stay focused on their own personal interests."" (7) ASH: At the same time creates stereotypes because if girls no longer are pressured then they say that Girls are smarter than boys. There is no better result for this. Instead of going in to an opposite direction to fix this problem, try and tackle it head on. In Virginia it is against the law to commit a crime while wearing a bullet proof vest. Instead making that law to capture them easily, instead go in for the boycott (analogy). Case 3: Un wanted pregnancy studies show that girls who go to single sex school have less unwanted pregnancies. (6) ""Decreased risk of teenage pregnancy.A533; One very robust finding in American schools is that girls who attend girlsA533; schools are dramatically less likely to experience pregnancy than are girls who attend coed schools.A533; For example, at The Young WomanA533;s Leadership School (TYWLS) in Harlem, the rate of teenage pregnancy is about one girl in 40; the rate of teenage pregnancy for other girls in the neighborhood is about one girl in three (Chris Farmer, personal communication, 2003).A533; Thus, the risk of pregnancy for girls attending TYWLS is roughly an order of magnitude lower than for other girls in the neighborhood.A533; Critics respond that TYWLS is a selective school and that girls selected to attend TYWLS may be less likely to experience an unwanted pregnancy regardless of what school they attend.A533; For that reason, the A533;before and afterA533; experience of schools such as the James Lyng High School is instructive.A533; When the school was coed, about 15 girls a year experienced an unwanted pregnancy; after the switch to a coed format, only about A533;one or twoA533; girls a year experienced a pregnancy (Wayne Commeford, personal communication, 2003).A533;Because the Lyng High School is not a selective school but is a regular public school which did not change its enrollment procedures after the switch to the single-sex format, it seems clear that the dramatic reduction in pregnancies was due to the change in format from coed to single-sex. Ash: You are right. The girls are not going to want pregnancy, or boys, husbands, knowledge of the opposite sex. And stereotypical views. So yea, youre right 1.http://www.personal.psu.edu...

51	S428a8bea-A6fcf1b51	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single Sex Schools Are Better for Education.	"To begin I would like to review a few points from the last few posts that have been made by both MassRebut and I. After that, then I will end with my conclusion. My argument will reiterate and add new and different points to bring to focus when looking at single-sex schools versus co-educational schools. ----- If MassRebut was not implying or assuming that ""single-sex schools are better for education,"" in the first statement of his previous post, I ask myself why he remains in the debate after negating his own line of logic. Looking at MassRebut""s cited debate point (along with the title of our entire debate) MassRebut can realize the forfeit of his argument with the statement of ""no where have I implied or assumed or even suggested that single sex schools are better for education"". When I stated, ""there are no jobs that only hire one sex,"" this was an example to show that single-sex education is not the best for students because it does not prepare students for the co-ed work world. To reiterate: there is not ""one job"" that accepts only males or only females. Two main purposes of US education are learning basic knowledge and socialization skills. The working world includes interaction with both sexes. In single-sex schools, the individual is only exposed to and socialized with one group. Students in single-sex schools are therefore prepared to work and cooperate with only one gender. Therefore, single-sex schools do not prepare students for the world of employment. Co-educational schools have the two purposes fulfilled (learning a basis of knowledge and socialization), whereas single-sex schools only include the knowledge base. ----- ""Boys and girls are interested in each other and define themselves by it as stated by it as stated by Dragonrule029 but they could try for the football team or for the musical for a million other reasons not just because they are interested. They could also be doing it to impress someone or get the attention or to even become friends with someone, which proves my point correct which stated that students have different driving factors in co-ed schools and they deviate from their true paths just because the other sex is present. Even I agree that ""Not everything that is done in schools is meant to ""show-off"""" but is certainly influenced by the other sex and even that depends on how much interested they are or how much they like and want to impress each other which is not a good learning environment for them."" We have agreed that not all actions are done to show off, according to the quoted statement above. Although, I would like to point out that in MassRebut""s first argument he said ""every action of the student is because he wants to impress or show off to someone he likes in the school"" and in the quotations above MassRebut says: ""Even I agree that ""Not everything that is done in schools is meant to ""show-off"""""" which is therefore contradicting and negates that part of the argument. Regarding influencing the opposite sex, since I have already negated where that statement began, MassRebut can decide if he would like to pick up that piece of the argument again or not. ----- ""When Dragonrule029 talks about homosexuality and how it will cause the same level of distraction as it will in co - education schools and students will be distracted no matter where they are, well this view is completely wrong. Why? Well, because not all students are homosexual and there is a 1% chance that one or two students will be and so how will this make other students distracted, the ones who are not involved and the ones who do not care? In co-ed schools, everyone would be looking at each other and the level of distraction in these schools is incomparable to single sex schools and to homosexual students. And what are the chances that there are not homosexuals in co-ed schools?"" This is yet another interpretation that was taken incorrectly, not to mention the fact that more than 1% of the student body could be homosexual or another type of sexual attraction. Studies have shown that 12% of students identify as homosexual or other. The entire point of mentioning the homosexual population was to show that it does not matter where a student attends school, there will always be the ""distraction of attraction"". ----- Another reason why co-educational schools are better for education: Non-segregation. This can be looked at through the lens of a similar situation where there was an attempt to separate two groups. The Jim Crow laws of ""Separate but equal"" would ring a bell if MassRebut has had any basic American history. The belief was that because students ""look"" different their education should be different - but when comparing the African-American and the Caucasian school districts of the time, it was obvious that indeed they were not ""equal"" but in fact only ""separate"". Jim Crow laws"" reasoning was that the two groups thought differently, had different needs, and needed different educational settings. Examples of the fallacies of ""separate but equal"" were clearly seen throughout the education programs at that time and are valid concerns even in a modern day setting of ""separate but equal"" gender-based schools. ----- Developing relationships with the opposite sex: Developing relationships with the opposite sex does not necessarily mean a boyfriend/girlfriend situation; it could mean a mental bond such as friendships. Different kinds of friendships are important in the development of a human being (both boys and girls are both human beings and they deserve to be treated as such). Like previously stated in the section I wrote about the ""purposes of education"", examples can be seen why girls and boys should work together in classes. Part of that general statement was that they must learn to interact with each other so the idea of working with the other sex is not foreign. To add on to that thought, friendships and social experiences in schools between males and females will help them develop as individuals. ----- Statement from MassRebut: ""Firstly, I'll talk about girls. Simple statement: They are better off in single sex schools. Women in particular benefit from a single-sex education; research shows that they participate more in class, develop much higher self-esteem, score higher in aptitude tests, are more likely to choose ""male"" disciplines such as science in college, and are more successful in their careers."" Even though MassRebut states that in single-sex schools girls chose more male-dominated fields, it remains to be proven if this is due to location in a single-sex environment or due to other contributing factors (teacher skills, parent support, personality traits, etc.). It is a fact that student success is correlated to the way the teacher distributes knowledge to the students. Differentiation in instruction means that the teacher must present the knowledge in a way the students will understand it. This is true in every educational setting. The responsibility lies with educators to design their lessons to reach their students"" learning needs, not simply segregate groups by sexes to simplify the teaching role. The teacher must take the responsibility of properly including and differentiating instructional methods, in order to best teach all students in his or her classroom. In addition, Stereotyping is increased when attending single-sex schools because neither gender interacts with the other. The placement of students in single-sex schools influence both groups to adopt more gender-oriented roles while attending their school (example: females choosing to be nurses, teachers or secretaries, with males choosing to be engineers, electricians or administrators). Also, imagine the girls who are put in the single-sex class under the basis that it will be a better learning environment so they can eliminate the distraction of the males in order to be more successful? What will that mean to them? If they are directly or indirectly told that they cannot be successful while studying with males nearby, this will affect how they are able to relate and work with males in their lifetime. It may even cause some young women to believe that if they are with males, their lives become unsuccessful. This (as mentioned before) will also affect their willingness to work, cooperate, and interact with the opposite sex in future environments. To conclude my argument: -Girls and boys must learn to work with one another (can only be offered in co-ed schools) -Distraction of attraction will be everywhere -Single-sex schools are segregated environments -Stereotyping is increased in single-sex schools -The teacher determines the success of the student not the gender makeup of the classroom Therefore, co-ed schools are still better for education than single-sex schools. This concludes my argument."	CON	need sex education schools	need sex education school
51	S6bece754-Add34c9f8	2	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Comprehensive Sex Education	"Re: IntroductionTeachers cannot pick and choose the curriculum that is taught in public schools. If a teacher would like to promote or avoid particular subjects, they would have to teach in a religious or private school. ""School districts limit teachers’ religious expression in order to avoid violating the establishment clause... When teachers speak to their classes, they represent the school and the school board. Teachers, as agents of the government, may not inculcate students... Otherwise, they run afoul of the establishment clause"" [1].Whether or not a teacher has or promotes religious ideals, their job as a public school official is to promote school policy regardless of their own beliefs. In the last round, I've explained how sex education is an extricable part of both health and science education, thus has a place in public schools.My opponent mentions that by exposing kids to the topic of sex, it might get them talking about sex amongst their friends (which we should assume they have and/or will do anyway). But gossip among uninformed children is specifically why sex education is so important. Rather than have a group of ignorant young people trade misconstrued and false information, sex education can provide valuable insight that is both factual and accurate. The alternative is having kids pass along misinformation they overheard or attained from problematic sources. Re: Teacher's ObligationsCon argues that because we cannot be sure teachers are teaching sex ed effectively, we should drop it. By that logic, why teach math, science, english or any other subject? We implement standards in education such as standardized testing and teacher performance reviews to promote competency amongst educators. This is how we measure effectiveness and promote the best teachers possible. If teachers are observed to not teach sex ed effectively, their competency as an educator should be called into question. School is filled with a lot of sensitive and controversial subjects including political discourse, the subject of evolution, and tragic or heated occurrences in history (especially war and terrorism). Teachers should not shy away from these important discussions, and if they are not comfortable having them, they should not be hired or keep their jobs. Research shows that there is a great benefit to tackling tough subjects in the classroom, particularly where people have different ideals. This promotes discussion, learning, tolerance and understanding. ""Addressing tough topics is a critical component of building community in the classroom. Real community is based on the full acknowledgement of difference, as well as the establishment of common purposes. When children are comfortable sharing their unique histories, there is the potential to uncover shared experiences and to identify themes for investigation"" [2]. It is important to have tough class discussions [3] that prepare students for differences and challenges they will face in the real world [4]. Regardless of what approach teachers use, students should be equipped with the skills necessary to identify and understand multiple perspectives. Con questions if students are ready and willing to learn about sex at a certain age, but students do not get to choose their curriculum for any subject. However if they are uncomfortable, they may ask to be excused or take it up with their parents who can pull them out of the lesson, as I have explained. Furthermore, kids might not even realize that there are things they don't know about but should know about, which is why exposure to these lessons is so important. Re: Comprehensive Sex Education is IneffectiveThe effectiveness and success of comprehensive sex education is overwhelming. >> Researchers studied the National Survey of Family Growth to determine the impact of sexuality education on youth sexual risk-taking for young people ages 15-19, and found that teens who received comprehensive sex education were 50 percent less likely to experience pregnancy than those who received abstinence-only education [5].>> Two-thirds of the 48 comprehensive sex ed programs studied had positive effects: * 40% delayed sexual initiation, reduced the number of sexual partners, or increased condom or contraceptive use.* 30%reduced the frequency of sex, including a return to abstinence.* 60% reduced unprotected sex [6]. >> Researchers at the University of Washington set out to compare the sexual health risk of adolescents who have received various types of sex education. This study used data collected in 2002–03 through the National Survey of Family Growth, a nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics. The researchers analyzed data from 1,719 heterosexual respondents to the NSFG who were 15–19. The results? ""Young people who received comprehensive sex education were 50% less likely to report a teen pregnancy compared to those who received no sex education... this study confirms that abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are NOT effective in changing young people’s sexual behavior or preventing negative outcomes such as teen pregnancy. More importantly, however, it confirms that programs that teach young people about both abstinence and contraception/disease prevention are, in fact, effective"" [7]. >> Comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV according to the American Psychological Association. Research shows that 1 in 5 adolescents will have sex before the age of 15, and ""only comprehensive sex education is effective in protecting adolescents from pregnancy and sexually transmitted illnesses at first intercourse and during later sexual activity. In contrast, scientifically sound studies of abstinence only programs show an unintended consequence of unprotected sex at first intercourse and during later sexual activity. In this way, abstinence only programs increase the risk of these adolescents for pregnancy and sexually transmitted illnesses, including HIV/AIDS"" [8].Con hasn't provided much information about why her studies ought to be considered valuable; we don't know the size, scope and sample study information. The vast majority of research overwhelmingly supports my position. I could provide innumerable other sources that are peer reviewed and explain what seems obvious: when students learn how to protect themselves, they will be able to. When students DON'T know what to worry about or how to be safe, they likely won't be safe. But I don't have the character space, so that logical conclusion should be accepted.My opponent will not be able to prove that parents will teach their children everything they should know about sex, or that by bringing the topic of sex up in school will somehow promote sex. History shows that young people have been having sex since they've reached puberty since the beginning of humanity. Puberty typically occurs between ages 9-13 and it was common for our ancestors to have sex around age 12-14 for optimal reproduction [9]. This is when adolescents today still start feeling sexual urges despite our cultural conditioning that suggests we should delay sex until we are mentally mature.Re: Waste of Government MoneyThe U.S. has the highest rates of teenage pregnancy and STDs among developed countries [10]. Almost 90% of Americans believe that it is important for young people to have information about contraception and prevention of STIs, and that sex education should focus on how to avoid unintended pregnancy and STIs [11]. Ergo the citizen's voices should be heard since people are in danger, and they want others and our youth to be informed. Studies show that health and academic achievement are linked. Sexual risk taking and its unintended consequences can negatively impact students at school. Health classes and sex education can reduce the prospect of one contracting an STI. My opponent defeats her own argument in talking about sex when she says kids will ""do as they please."" Research agrees and shows that students will have sex regardless of whether or not they are taught about sex in school, so it makes sense to assume that teaching about safety will promote sexual safety [12]. Re: Immorality of Sex Education Con's only argument on why sex ed is ""immoral"" is because some parents are uncomfortable with it. Some parents are uncomfortable with their child eating gluten, but that doesn't mean gluten is immoral. There is nothing inherently immoral about sex; it is a natural, biological function that is inherent to life and reproduction. It is human instinct. If some people find it immoral, that is their biased prerogative. I am not advocating to force sex ed amongst a child against their parent's will. I've repeatedly explained that children should speak up if they are uncomfortable. In the last round, I outlined that parents have every right to inhibit their child from the discussion (the same way they can not expose their child to the lessons on puberty and reproductive organs/health). Con writes, ""By having kids perform these exercise, and giving them ideas, we are almost convincing them to go out and have sex"" which is unsupported. This is a bare assertion with no proof. In fact kids are exposed to sex in the media [13] including television [14] and especially online [15]. Moreover, statistics show that teaching about sex sometimes leads to a decline in sexual activity. See my earlier point about studies showing that comprehensive sex ed leads to a delay in sexual activity. Condoms are over 98% effective when used properly [16]. This is a lot more than 0% effective which is what Con's proposition supports. If kids don't know the dangers of unprotected sex or how to properly protect themselves, they are more likely to engage in riskier behavior that promotes harm. SOURCES: http://tinyurl.com..."

51	S48c4bfcb-Ade3d6ba1	2	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex Education should be taught in public schools.	"""I. Unbiased means teaching the facts. The various examples you posted are no facts they are clear over exaggerations. 1. How to rape 2. Why smoking is good 3. Do drugs 4. Become Anorexic 5. Surpass the brink of obesity In cases were both sides have some valid points, such as two politicians debating about the economy or foreign policy, then that's unbiased because it is presenting facts and both points of view. In the points above, the facts about smoking, drugs, obesity, anorexia, and rape are all obviously clear - they end up hurting you one way or another; any other information given would be lies and turn from an unbiased education to propaganda. Moreover, the above examples make the implication that sex can be ranked among the list above, ranked with smoking, drugs, obesity as if it was something that can lead to a cancer or other disease. Sex is proven to be a necessary bodily function and a person actually NEEDS to have sex for their own health and to continue life. To rank sex or even imply that sex could be ranked with the above just shows how little knowledge of the subject you actually have. You also say ""All these things are good from the perspective of the person doing…"" I know many people who wished they didn't smoke, could control their sexual impulses, weren't addicted to drugs and are trying to quit, and want to loose weight. I will give you that anorexia is the exception. "" ITS NOT CLEAR DENYING ANY INFORMATION IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS UNJUST. ADVOCATING THIS IS RIDICULOUS. "" In a perfect world, every parent would pass on the knowledge they need to conduct safe and happy sex lives, but in reality we know this doesn't happen. Talking about sex with a child, especially your own child can be very difficult. Parents, more often than not, like to live in their bubble and think every other kids is doing it but not mine. This is what ultimately led to sex education, parents weren't teaching it and somebody had to. Here's my theory, if cavemen were able to figure out ""how to do it"" then two teenagers growing up in a world were sex permeates almost all of our most daily activities, from television commercials and advertisements to asking were babies come from, they will find out about sex. The problem is they will know about it, but not know everything that they need to conduct sex safely. They learn about friends who don't know what they're talking about, or inexperienced older brothers and sisters, or the occasional stranger or teacher. 2 out of 3 will give misinformation. Unless a child in forbidden from leaving the house or watching TV one way or another sex will come up, that isn't even a question, even if you put a guy and a girl on a deserted island they will figure it out. That means they need to be prepared and prepared properly. Abstinence programs have been attempted to no avail. One study done in Texas by the British Medical Journal revealed that ""before the abstinence education 23% of ninth-graders have had sex, 28% did after the program was finished."" Then another study by the Center for Disease Control found that those who took ""virginity pledges"" delayed in any sexual activity by 6 months. But after that, they discovered oral and anal sex, which are apparently still ok somehow, and didn't know a thing about the use of condoms, birth control, or any other forms of safe sex. They were also more likely to get a STD than those who had a real sex education. Eventually 88% go on to have pre-marital sex. Even the ones who remain virgins until marriage, they still eventually have sex, and just because your married doesn't mean you're safe from STDs. Furthermore, going back to my contentions about the difference between and unbiased education and teaching the facts. According to a Washington Post study, in abstinence only education they are actually ""taught"" Half the gay male teenagers in the U.S. have AIDS. (Another ""fact"" is that only homosexuals can get AIDS.) Touching a persons genitals can result in pregnancy (there are other variations like oral sex, masturbation, and the like could do the same). A forty three-day-old fetus is a ""thinking person"" (their brain has sometimes not even developed by this point). AIDS can be spread through sweat and tears Condoms fail to protect the transmission of AIDS 31% of the time – the actual number is 3% according to the Center for Disease control. Women who have abortions are ""more prone to suicide"" and as many as 10% become sterile. Just slightly biased don't you think?"" Lot of problems but teaching kids will not fix them. ""Finally, a word on morals. It might be against one person's morals to teach sex education in schools, but I know for sure that that isn't everyone's morals. Because there isn't a definite majority (like 98% lets say), since there are conflicting morals, the facts should be taught at schools and the morals taught at home. The schools has no right to preach to me about sex when I and my parents would much rather I learn about safe practices instead of propaganda spread by these self-proclaimed ""moral entrepreneurs.""""

51	S937b1a96-A198bbc54	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single-gendered classrooms	C1. Single-sex institutions are bad for the emotional health of males.Men always say that they do not understand women, perhaps because they were sent to single sex schools. Research has proved that boys who went to single sex schools as opposed to mixed schools are more likely to get divorced and suffer from depression in their 40. This is proof that we should school our children in mixed schools in order to give them the best bill of emotional health. Dr. Diana Leonard, who presented the findings, concluded that ‘Boys learn better when they are with girls and they actually learn to get on better’.C2. Single-sex schools are manifestations of patriarchal societiesSingle-sex schools are a throwback to the patriarchal society of the past; in many historical cultures, only men were allowed an education of any sort. To perpetuate this is to remind women of their past subservience and to continue to hold them from full social inclusion. In India, where the colonial yoke of British rule remains, the national average for the difference in male-female literacy is 16.7%, with some districts as high as 28%. Single-sex schools discourage female education and make it increasingly difficult for parents to find room for girls in the limited co-educational schools. A push for single-sex education therefore is ‘predicated on outdated, moronic, and destructive gender stereotypes’. C3. Children need to be exposed to the opposite sex in preparation for later lifeThe formative years of children are the best time to expose them to the company of the other gender, in order that they may learn each other’s’ behaviour and be better prepared for adult life. The number of subjects benefiting from single-sex discussion is so small that this could easily be organised within a co-educational system. Furthermore, even if girls naturally perform better in an environment without boys, they need to learn how to perform just as well with boys. Dr. Alan Smithers, a respected British schools expert, declared in a 2006 report that ‘distraction by boys was a myth’ and that ‘half a century of research has not shown any dramatic or consistent advantages for single-sex education for boys or girls’.sourcesGarner, R. ‘Why single-sex schools are bad for your health’.

I am surprised you had no comment about the importance of respect. I must say, it bothers me respectfulness doesn't SEEM to be of an importance to you. ""All the more reason to keep at the education. Currently, 83.5% of teenagers use condoms, pills, injections, or vaginal rings to protect against pregnancy, and only 12.9% had used no birth control in their last sexual encounter [1]. When this statistic is placed in the context of the correlation between mandatory sexual education, and teenage pregnancies by state, there is strong evidence to suggest that sexual education decreases the likelihood of teenage pregnancies [2].""Not standard sex education. It decreases the likelihood of teenage pregnancies, but doesn't guarantee you will not get pregnant and doesn't protect you against ALL STD's. Not only this, the contraceptive only protects you wear you are covered at. This being said, it is really easy to get a STD because of contact between the semen and skin. ""Sex ed doesn't encourage sex, it encourages safe sex practices [3]. Also, of course there will be risks, but there is a reduced risk (I reiterate the strong correlation between contraceptive use and teenage pregnancy)."" Why have a reduced risk when there could be no risk? Besides who wants to be infertile?

Usually, but not always, this fluid is regenerated once the woman goes off the pill. If the fluid is damaged or not regenerated, there is a possibility that conception could be impacted."" ""it is possible that bacteria will hitch a ride on the IUD device, enter the uterus causing it to become infected and damaged. If infected, the infection can, in some cases, lead to infertility.""""According to the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, abstinence only education has ""not demonstrated successful outcomes with re-gard to delayed initiation of sexual activity or use of safer sex practices"" [4]. Also, your source regarding the alleged decrease in sexual activity from abstinence only education asserts that: ""Two years after attending an eight-hour abstinence program, about one-third of the participants had initiated sexual activity, compared to nearly one-half of the non-participants who enrolled in a general health program. That is, the abstinence program reduced the rate of sexual initiation by one-third."" One half minus one third is one sixth.

I guess you didn't want to read that evidence I presented supporting abstinence programs in round one, huh?Here, I'll put some more salt on that wound.http://www.heritage.org... ""Not Me, Not Now. Not Me, Not Now, a community-wide abstinence intervention program, targeted children ages nine through 14 in Monroe County, New York, which includes the city of Rochester. The Not Me, Not Now program devised a mass communications strategy to promote the abstinence message through paid television and radio advertising, billboards, posters distributed in schools, educational materials for parents, an interactive Web site, and educational sessions in school and community settings. The program had five objectives: raising awareness of the problem of teen pregnancy, increasing understanding of the negative consequences of teen pregnancy, developing resistance to peer pressure, promoting parent- child communication, and promoting abstinence among teens.Not Me, Not Now was effective in reaching early teens, with some 95 percent of the target audience in the county reporting that they had seen a Not Me, Not Now ad. During the intervention period, there was a statistically significant positive shift in attitudes among pre-teens and early teens in the county.The sexual activity rate of 15-year-olds across the county dropped by a statistically significant amount, from 46.6 percent to 31.6 percent, during this period.[33] The pregnancy rate for girls ages 15 through 17 in Monroe County fell by a statistically significant amount, from 63.4 pregnancies per 1,000 girls to 49.5 pregnancies per 1,000. The teen pregnancy rate fell more rapidly in Monroe County than in comparison counties and upstate New York in general, and the differences in the rates of decrease were statistically significant.[34]"" ""Exactly, it does keep me safe. As for encouragement, I can't say, as I have never driven any significant distance without wearing it.""Well, I know having a seat belt in a car enourages me to drive because it makes me FEEL safe.

Abortion is an entirely other debate.""Well, technically this is going off topic anyways. Why? A less need for children goes along the lines of overpopulation. We aren't debating whether the world is overpopulated or not. We are debating whether standard sex education is beneficial or not.

The program targeted seventh, eighth, and ninth grade students and reached about 4,000 youths each year. The curriculum included a five-day workshop with speakers, presentations, skits, videos, and an adult mentoring component.A 2001 evaluation analyzed a sample of 329 students and found that only 5.9 percent of eighth grade girls who had participated in Abstinence by Choice a year earlier had initiated sexual activity compared with 10.2 percent of non-participants. Among eighth grade boy participants, 15.8 percent had initiated sexual activity, compared with 22.8 percent among non-participating boys.[35] (The sexual activity rate of students in the program was compared with the rate of sexual activity among control students in the same grade and schools prior to commencement of the program.)""""""Project Taking Charge. Project Taking Charge was a six-week abstinence curriculum delivered in home economics classes during the school year. It was designed for use in low-income communities with high rates of teen pregnancy. The curriculum contained elements on self-development; basic information about sexual biology (e.g., anatomy, physiology, and pregnancy); vocational goal-setting; family communication; and values instruction on the importance of delaying sexual activity until marriage.The program was evaluated in Wilmington, Delaware, and West Point, Mississippi, based on a small sample of 91 adolescents.[40] Control and experimental groups were created by randomly assigning classrooms either to receive or not to receive the program. The students were assessed immediately before and after the program and at a six-month follow-up. In the six-month follow-up, Project Taking Charge was shown to have had a statistically significant effect in increasing adolescents' knowledge of the problems associated with teen pregnancy, the problems of sexually transmitted diseases, and reproductive biology.The program may also have delayed the onset of sexual activity among some of the participants. About 23 percent of participants who were virgins at the pretest initiated sexual activity during the follow-up interval, compared with 50 percent of the youths in the control group, although the authors urged caution in interpreting these numbers due to the small sample size.[41]"""	PRO	need sex education schools	need sex education school

"The big problem with your case is: sex education is already taught in schools, so no policy needs to be taken. First of all, I'll assume we're talking about an policy action being taken by the United States government. This is fair because the majority of users on this site, including both me and you (according to your profile) are American. Also, the term ""should"" indicates that a policy action should be taken. It indicates that a change should be made in our laws because of some benefit. Regardless of the benefit accrued by the policy you advocate, if the current system can do what you advocate, then there is no reason to take the policy. In policy debate this is known as inherency. If a policy action is to be taken, the person advocating the policy must prove that the status quo is not already solving for the plan he presents. Otherwise, why advocate the plan if it is not a change? In all areas of the United States sex education is taught or the legal framework is in place that its constituents could teach sex education if they so choose.

That young people have the right to comprehensive sexuality education. “Comprehensive”, in this sense, does mean sex education that extends to condom use. It means an approach to sex education that covers scientific, ethical, medical, emotional, and religious issues. Sex education is not a subject which schools can rightfully exclude if they are to remain true to the central objective of progressive pedagogy – broadening the freedom and opportunities that young people can access by broadening their educational and social experiences. Indeed, it is irresponsible for to ignore one of the largest spheres of adult life. Many countries recognise this so make sex education compulsory, such as in Sweden where it has been compulsory since 1956.[1]Sending young people into the world with a dearth of knowledge about their bodies, relationships, and the practical realities of sex leaves them woefully unprepared for ""real life.""

It isn’t the place of schools to sexualize our children in this way. Many people believe that sex education should be left to parents, who are best placed to decide what information their children need and when the best time to tell them is.

I believe sex education should be in schools because it will give teens a chance to learn before they have to learn from mistakes. I understand some may think that many are not mature enough. That's why teachers need to start teaching at a time when many become the age that they start having sex. Though they may not be able to make them not/stop having sex, they should teach them about safe sex, and way to make sure you stay away from pregnancy and STDs.

51	S861da101-Aef070e72	0	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single-sex education	"First of all, I would like to thank Con for his politeness on wishing me a Merry Christmas. I hope he has had a merry Christmas also and would like to wish him a happy new year.This round I'll also form rebuttals and counterarguments. Lets start by SociabilityMy opponent stated on round 1 that ""Single-sex education hinders the development of social interaction between juvenile boys and girls"", argumenting that:""During the developmental years of the average teenager, intergender interactions are a necessity. Not only for gradual progression into a sociable individual, but also for achieving the happiness that accompanies a healthy relationship.""""As with most abilities, it will be easier to develop knowledge of the other sex at a young age. By segregating the two sexes into opposing institutions, the children are deprived of the opportunity to interact with the other sex on a regular basis.""Well, even if that was true, the main goal of schools is not to develop students socially. The main school purpose is to teach. Yes, it should be also a place where the students can interact with each other and make friends, but this comes in second place. Another common mistake about children going to same-sex schools is that they only have contact with one sex. This is wrong because (a) the student have parents which he lives with and interact with them every day, (b) a boy going to SS school may have a sister or a girl a brother so they would interact with the different sex at home, (c) the student can interact with the other sex doing activities that are not related to the school, like a foreingn language course or a sport and (d) a SS school for boys may have women teachers or a SS school for girls men teachers.Con also states that SS schools are ""Emotionally detrimental to young males"". A research made by Dr. Emer Smyth shows that boys in SS schools have a lower self-steem due to the academically competitive environment. SS schools are places where children go primarily to study. Although this might diminish the boys self-steem, they are better prepared academically than boys from CE schools. (1)And Con also cited: men educated in single-sex schools are more likely to “face divorce and depression by their early 40s.” I saw his source and it doesn't show details about the issue. And how SS school has anything to due with the men's divorce? It does not make any sense.Although I showed that Career and Educational aspiration are higher among SS school students than those in CE schools, Con states it`s because they are private schools. Well, the study was made with private CE schools an private SS schools. It put both in equity so the factor that changes the self-esteem is not being private or not, but the presence of the opposite sex.(1)And in round 3 Con shows a report from the American Council for CoEducational Schooling that break some myths about SS schooling. Of course this report will favor CE schooling! They are the American Council for CoEducational Schooling! Therefore, any argument from this report is invalid due to it's lack of neutrality on the issue. And about sex-stereotyping. I proved on round 2 that girls from SS schools have less stereotype gender role attitudes. As there aren't any boys the girls need to do things which in mixed environment would be considered boyish, like dissecting a frog. They also have favoured preference for subjects considered masculine more than girls from CE schools. And with researches about boys stereotyping there where no difference between CE or SS schools.(1)(2)AcademicallyCon tries to diminish the academic superiority from SS schools stating that they have good scores because they are private. Well, there are CE private schools, so why they do not have better scores than SS private schools? Con`s argument doesn't make any sense.As I stated have previously stated, the SS school environment favours a learning environment more than a social environment. Therefore, students from SS schools study more and have best results than students from CE schools. “By far, the advantage most often associated with schooling boys and girls separately is that it eliminates distraction. Freed from the worries of impressing the opposite sex, boys and girls can focus on their books” ""Janice Streitmatter studied and compared the results of girls taking physics in a coeducational and single-sex setting. According to Streitmatter (1998) the girls repeatedly asked the teacher questions and used the answers as opportunities for group learning. As a result of the opportunities for increased participation, achievement also improved. In Streitmatter's findings, in the single-sex physics class 87,5% of the girls made an ‘A’ and 12.5% of the girls made a ‘B’; whereas in the coeducational class only 14.3% of the girls made an ‘A’, 14.3% made a ‘B’, and 71.4% made a ‘C’."" ""By separating the sexes into different classes or schools, the students would be free of distractions from the opposite sex and would be better able to concentrate on academic pursuits."" (3)Giving the fact that SS schools favours academic, there is no reason why there shouldn't be more SS public schools. This opportunity should be opened for the disadvantaged ones who can't pay for a good private school. I don't think there should be only SS schools, but if students their are better academically and thus have a better chance in life, why not have more SS schools?Sources:1. http://ife.ens-lyon.fr...2. http://ecap.crc.illinois.edu...3. http://files.eric.ed.gov..."

51	S5c785ff5-A93562c4b	1	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex education should be mandatory in schools.	"Now I'm going to combine my two earlier claims by stating that the fact that it HAS to be mandatory along with counseling and what not is just not needed. Sex ed is a good idea and all, but do we really need it to be mandatory? That's the question. I don't know if I've been doing a such a good job during this argument, seeing as though there's not a lot of material to work with. But I'm still going to try. Now I know I'm fighting a losing battle; the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. But, in your earlier claims, you've stated that it HAS to be mandatory. BUT, what if the student doesn't necessarily want to take the class. Now I know what you're thinking, it's mandatory. That would be valid if it was due to something completely stupid, but have you thought about if a student was planning on staying abstinent? Or if they really just didn't want to take the class because they were scared? Then what would happen? Counselling? You may argue that they may still need to take the class, but do they really have too? Is it right to make someone who doesn't like the idea of having sex learn about it in school? This leads to my next claim, the education itself. Sure sex ed would be very informal, but again it isn't needed. At some point in someone's life, a person WILL get curious about how they were made. They will ask about the birds and the bees. As a child, have you ever asked your parents, ""Mommy? Daddy? How are babies made?"". At some point in your life, you will ask this, and eventually, parents will give you the correct answer. Key Word: eventually. At a certain stage, depending on your comfort level, they will tell you the answer, and that's the beauty of it all. Your parents know what you should and should not hear, and they know how to give it to you straight in a way that teachers don't. This was what I've been trying to state earlier. Another point is that there are plenty of sources on the Internet, from parents, from doctors, and at school that already inform you about sex and the sexually transmitted diseases. So naturally, the education is already inevitable, so making it mandatory would be useless. Now yes, whether or not they want to research this information or not is up to them, but that's were responsibility takes place. Inevitably, your parents are going to inform you about the birds and the bees. EVEN if it is a teenage mother, they might be able to inform their child about teen pregnancy and encourage him or her not to make the same mistake that they did, WHILE also, telling them about sex in general. At that point in your life, you should already have about one third of the information you need about sex. Next you may hear about sexually transmitted diseases from your health class, and at that point you'll have two thirds. Now I know not all schools have this, but I have an idea which will be stated before the end of this argument. Finally, the three thirds come in when you do research for yourself about these things. Again, whether a person decides to do this or not is up to them. But, this WILL help them become more responsible in their sex life, and also teach them to rely on others AS WELL AS themselves to gain the information they need to have a healthy and successful life, rather than the information being just thrown at them. And I know I keep repeating myself, but again, learning about sex is a process that not everyone feels comfortable with. So, I believe it should be introduced in three stages: preteen, teen, and young adult. Preteen: first introduced to sex by parents. Teen: introduced to sexually transmitted diseases. Young Adult: brief research on all these topics. This is a bit wordy, but I'll make my last claim for this round. Now because not all schools have a health class, I'll propose this: rather than having sex ed be mandatory, why not just include health class in every school in every country instead? For this idea, I've made some adjustments from your idea; it will be PARTIALLY mandatory. I'll get into more detail about why in the 4th round."

51	S71152e5e-A434dfefa	2	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex education in schools should be mandatory	"IntroductionI would like to begin my thanking my opponent, Lt.Harris, for accepting my debate. It is a salient topic amongst the parents of many students like myself. In this debate, I shall be arguing that students should be required to have sex education whilst in school. Arguments1. How will children find out about it?I happen to have been misfortunate enough to not find out about how babies were made until I was in 6th grade, simply because my parents refused to teach me the concept. Because of this, I was simply kept in the dark. This put me at a disadvantage because I was the only one who had no idea what every individual was talking about.I am also aware that many people are in the same predicament. By not being taught about sex, how would one find out? Most of the time, they wouldn't. Instead, they would be without knowledge of the real world. I wish for my opponent to tell me why it would be good for a child to be without knowledge of the real world. 2. How would children understand the dangers?As I am sure my opponent is aware, sex has many dangers, including children, STDs, etc. What if a child was unaware of these dangers and decided to have sex, not knowing the consequences? There is a good change they would become a parent, obtain an STD, or both. To make a long story short, it would not end well. This scenario could have been avoided if the two individuals had been previously educated as to what dangers come with sexual activity.This is a good reason to make sex education mandatory, for children should be forced to be into awareness of this topic. Without this awareness, STDs will only spread faster and poverty of homeless mothers will only increase. I wish for my opponent to tell my why this is a good thing.3. There is no good reason to keep this from themWhat would be the reason to keep this information from children? I cannot find one. However, there are many reasons not to keep it from them. Here are some facts:1. More that 47% of students say they have had sex. 2. 15% have had sex with four or more partners3. 3 in 10 girls will be pregnant before they are 204. These teenage pregnancies have resulted in $9.4 billion annually for child careThough these people were aware of what sex is, they did not fully understand the consequences. The percentage would have been much lower if they had been more aware.3. Sex is not grossOne of the reasons parents keep this from their children is because they believe sex to be gross, inappropriate, and vulgar. This, however, is false and is simply a bad reason. First of all, sex is a very natural occurrence. Secondly, it is a bad reason to keep facts from people. Though they are young, children have the right to know what goes on in the world around them. I wish for my opponent to tell me why it is a good idea to keep facts from children.ConclusionI have given my arguments as to why sex education should be mandatory. It is now time for my opponent to give his arguments as to why it should not be mandatory. I wait patiently for his arguments.Works Cited""State Policies on Sex Education in Schools.""

51	S5e2fadc8-Ab082c317	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Students from single sex schools fare better than children at mixed sex schools.	"Thank you for accepting this debate beagle_hugs. I am arguing that students at single sex schools fare better than children at mixed sex schools on four main grounds. 1) Confidence. Successful people are those who are confident. Confident in their abilities, in the workplace, in their home etc. Confidence breeds success. In a single sex environment students are likely to be far more confident in themselves and in their abilities. At single sex schools there is no sense that sports like football and rugby are for boys whilst netball and badminton are for girls. There is no sense that girls should be good at English, Art and textiles whilst boys should excel in Maths, Science and woodwork. Single sex schools are devoid of gender stereotypes which gives girls the confidence to pursue typically male oriented subjects and gives boys the chance to pursue more female oriented subjects. There are no gender related expectations which means that students at single sex schools are given the opportunity to pursue what they really want to and what they're good at rather than some unrealistic ideal. Single sex schools also make for an environment that allows students to become more confident in themselves. It gives students a chance to spend their time exploring who they are rather than exploring the opposite sex. Girls can freely raise their hands and answer questions that they know without the fear of being labelled a ""geek"" or a know it all. Boys can question things they don't understand without worrying that they seem stupid in front of a girl. Students at single sex schools can simply be themselves without trying to attract the opposite sex and can truly focus on their education. A person who truly knows who they are and who has a good strong education will quite frankly, fare better in the world. A person able to discover themselves fully- free of embarrassing puberty, or a self conscious desire to be attractive- will be more confident. A person with a strong academic record will be confident in their abilities and confident in their aspirations to follow a particular career. A confident person is one who is able to develop properly in their own right and given the best possible chance of academic success. Such a person is one who attends a single-sex school. 2) Distractions. Girls are distracted by boys and boys are distracted by girls. Even if only because it's not what we know, it something that we are not. With age comes puberty and sexual desire and before you know it girls aged 13 are learning how to flaunt their new breasts and slight curves. These same girls are trying out their mother's make up in an attempt to make themselves as attractive to the other sex as possible. Boys kissing girls, touching girls etc. It becomes the pursuit of the young, hormonal teenager. It's annoying, it's inevitable and it's something that all teenagers have to deal with. Let them deal with it at the weekends, let them deal with these newfound feelings in the evenings but spare them the embarrassment, the effort and the distraction from the hours of 9-4pm and they will be better for it. Girls at all girls schools can saunter in without make up, wearing any old clothes, can eat what they want for lunch without feeling conscious, can raise their hands in classes, can properly run about in sports not concerned with their bodies and can focuse on their friendships, studies and who they are. Boys don't have to worry about who they want to ask out, why they're still virgins and why they can't grow a beard when their best friend has stubble already. Its ONE less, ONE huge distraction that students can be spared during their school days. With no distraction, students can focus on their studies more and on who they are which, in the long run will make them fare better. 3) Babies, STDs, pregnancy scares etc. At a single sex school there is 1) less chance of meeting someone of the opposite gender and 2) less chance of fondling, tumbling around, having sex etc. Therefore, chances are- that the ramifications of sexual activity are less likely to occur during the school days. This means that whatever money any student has (not much) can be spent on themselves and not on pregnancy tests or a baby. It means students have one less thing to worry about without the added pressure of a missed period, a possible STD or a cheating partner. Women don't have to suffer the ""glass ceiling"" before they've even paved their careers and left school. It means students aren't tied down with a baby and so can travel the world after school or attend university in a different location or a different country. Students can properly spend these formative years making (rightfully) selfish decisions to better their lives, their education, their opportunities without having to think about their partner or their children. It means that students from single sex schools can think about their lives, can plan and make fully informed decisions about who they want to share parenthood with and when without having to submit to any foolish decisions/mistakes made as a self conscious, naive teenager. The end result? Someome who has lived their life how they want to and made key decisions to better their future. On a personal, professional and familial level- this enables students at single sex schools the chance to fare better in life, 4) It's proven that single sex education works! Boys study better with boys. Girls study better with girls. The stats, reflect this. Boys and girls learn in different ways and schools simply cannot tailor towards this when they are trying to educate both boys and girls together. Single sex schools however, are far more able to accommodate their students accordingly, giving them a better education, the opportunity to pursue a better career and overall enabling them to fare better in life. This is illustrated by the fact that students from single sex schools are more likely to pursue further education and are more likely to get better results. This is afterall the purpose of an education and the foundations for a successful life academically and on a personal level as students become confident adults secure in their abilities and who they are before they start to explore the opposite sex later in life. http://www.singlesexschools.org... http://everydaylife.globalpost.com..."

51	S8be2b95f-Aa0533be7	1	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Sex Education Should Be Taught In Schools	"Thank you for posting your rebuttal! Here's my defense. First, my opponent says that schools should teach a course similar to the D.A.R.E. program and its ""just say no"" message. I'll break this down into a couple parts, starting with the D.A.R.E. approach and then the message they should teach, according to my opponent. I. D.A.R.E.To start, D.A.R.E. doesn't relate to sex education. ""Launched in 1983, D.A.R.E. is a comprehensive K-12 education program taught in thousands of schools in America and 52 other countries. D.A.R.E. curricula address drugs, violence, bullying, internet safety, and other high risk circumstances that today are too often a part of students’ lives."" [1] D.A.R.E. mainly focuses on drugs and bullying. You can see this if you look at the D.A.R.E. website previously cited.Also, it's been proven that the D.A.R.E. program has been ineffective, in terms of its anti-drug message. ""Students who went through DARE weren’t any less likely to do drugs than the students who didn’t. In fact, there’s some well-regarded research that some groups of students were actually morelikely to do drugs if they went through DARE. ""Scientists knew DARE was ineffective relatively early on, but the program grew anyways. The program’s eventual reform was the result of a long and hard battle between evidence-based research, and popular opinion."" [2]Also, may I add, my opponent said ""Why not just give them a course similar to DARE..."" This goes against his entire argument saying that sex education shouldn't be taught in schools, as he says they should teach a program like D.A.R.E.. He contradicts himself in that round. I'm not saying it takes away from his arguments, but it's something to think about. II. ""Just Say No."" I'll just put this out there: this is a prime example of sexual repression. ""Sexual repression is a state in which a person is prevented from expressing his or her sexuality. Sexual repression is often associated with feelings of guilt or shame being associated with sexual impulses."" [3]What are some examples of this? Condemning homosexuals, slut shaming, and the argument that we should ""wait until marriage"" to have intercourse are some common examples. But why should we teach the concept of ""just say no""? My opponent never explains this in a clear way. He attempts to, but I'll get to that later. Anyway, I can agree with this, but only in certain circumstances. If the teenager in question isn't interested in sex or wants to wait, that's up to them. If someone is attempting to sexually abuse or rape them, they have every right to say no. But again, everyone is entitled to their body. If they consent to safe, healthy sex, I see no problem. While some may not agree with it, they aren't in that situation. It's only an issue to the two (or more) people involved in the sexual acts. I mentioned earlier that my opponent tried to give a reason as to why we should teach ""just say no."" He said ""condoms are only 98% effective, while just 'not' is a full 100% guaranteed to prevent pregnancies.""What makes my opponent think that condoms are only 98% effective? That's a pretty large percentage! The remaining 2% could be a result of the condom tearing or going past its expiration date. (Yes, as ridiculous as it sounds, condoms do have an expiration date. [4])""No type of condom prevents pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) 100% of the time. But if you and your partner are having sex, nothing protects against STDs better than a properly used condom."" [5] Yes, not having sex does mean a 100% chance of not getting pregnant, (unless you count sperm donations and such) but again, everyone is entitled to their body. If they want to have sex, they should be allowed to, as long as it is consensual and not hurting anyone. Thank you for an interesting debate. As the rules say, I ask my opponent to waive the following round.

51	S6bece754-A67b96245	1	1	Do we need sex education in schools?	Comprehensive Sex Education	"Thank you Pro. I will be rebutting Pro’s case from R2, and if there are enough characters left, I shall defend my case. Rebuttal #1 “Do schools have the right to teach about sex? Should they?” My opponent states “Teaching CSE provides information that directly relates to the lives, health and safety of sexually active teens, as well as prepares the other half so they will be better equipped to understand the consequences and options.” Teachers do in fact have the right to teach students about sex education. But, as I have argued, are teachers actually qualified to teach about sex? As I had stated in my round, a lot of teachers feel it’s not their place to teach other people kids about sex, nor are they very knowledgeable themselves on the topic. [1] “Four in five teachers said they did not feel adequately trained and confident to broach the sensitive topic with pupils, while half admitted it is ""difficult to discuss"". There were also concerns that religious faith could be denying children access to a proper sex education, with six out of ten teachers claiming that discussing sex, relationships and lifestyle choices ""can go against religious beliefs"". Who is to blame, if a kid goes out, and has sex, but ends up pregnant, or obtains some STD, yet they were taught sex ed in middle school, and the child thought they had taken the necessary precautions before having sex? Who says if a teacher is under-qualified to teach such a personal subject? The teacher themselves will not truly know if they’re uncomfortable until they are actually in the moment of teaching, and answering questions from students. [1] “More than nine in ten parents said it was ""very important"" for their children to be properly informed on safe sex and contraception, but only a fifth of teachers felt capable of doing so.” We should not force teachers to teach a subject that is not actually required to be taught in all schools. If we force a teacher to teach sex ed, what is he/se gives wrong advice to a student, because they’re unknowledgeable, or embarrassed, then whose fault is it? Rebuttal #2 “What if parents think the topic is inappropriate?” This goes back to my argument in rebuttal #1. We can’t and shouldn’t force teachers to teach a subject they are uncomfortable with. Especially when 18 of 21 states don’t require there sex teachings to be 100% accurate. [2] “According to a March 2012 report released by the National Conference of State Legislators, only 21 states and the District of Columbia require schools to teach sex education. And, in a finding that should jolt parents and teachers out of their chairs, only 18 states require that the information be medically accurate.” Sure, parents may keep their child from going to this particular class, but that isn’t the issue. The issue is the flaws, and mistakes that are being shown, and made by the teachers that are teaching the topic. Maybe it is for the best that children be kept home, instead of going to this particular class, where parents expect their children to be taught correctly, and not use un-reliable, misleading facts. [2] ""Lessons on reproductive anatomy and basic functioning were often incomplete and pervasive factual limitations reflected gender stereotypes and heterocentric bias."" The survey also found explicit moral overtones regarding sexuality, the value of abstinence, teen pregnancy and family life in many of the curricula.” If we take a step back, and look at the bigger teacher, we will see that keeping some kids from going to the class, and letting others take the class is completely unfair, considering that many of these classes are flawed, and the children who actually take these classes will be effected in the most negative way, in the long run. I will not rebut my opponents case on why comprehensive should be taught over abstinence, because from my arguments, and sources, I have proved that comprehensive is just as ineffective then abstinence. Thusly, I am merely arguing sex edu. No t be taught in schools, because both comprehensive, and abstinence are ineffective, and parent’s should instead teach their children on the topic. DEFENDING MY CASE: On teachers obligation: Pro states “Con argues that because we cannot be sure teachers are teaching sex ed effectively, we should drop it. By that logic, why teach math, science, English or any other subject?” Teachers who teach in high school, generally teach one subject, that they are trained in. [3] “However, if you teach high school, you are more likely to be instructing a single subject and should therefore have a much deeper understanding of that field.” Because I said teachers are not qualified, or knowledgeable on sex education, my opponent tries to argue that teachers aren’t qualified in teaching Math, English, or any other subjects. Yet, as I have proven, High school teachers are trained on the subject, and then share that knowledge with their students. It’s a subject they have been trained on, and studied, you can’t say the say about sex education, which my opponent has failed to do. On Comprehension being ineffective. Pro states “My opponent will not be able to prove that parents will teach their children everything they should know about sex, or that by bringing the topic of sex up in school will somehow promote sex. History shows that young people have been having sex since they've reached puberty since the beginning of humanity.” As I have argued multiple times, many teachers expressed their feelings towards teaching sex ed, such as, themselves feeling unknowledgeable, and un-informed, and embarrassed. To win this argument, my opponent must prove that teachers are more qualified to teach sex edu, than parents are. I myself, have already won this argument, by giving a source, that goes to medically correct. show “only 18 states require that the information be medically accurate” If their curriculum and programs are inaccurate, mistakes will be made when teens have sex. So, it is inaccurate to say, that all teachings of comprehensive sex in schools are accurate, when only 18 states require the information to be taught, to be medically correct, which then ties into my rebuttal on money. Why should we fund a program, when most of them aren't teaching children material that is medically correct? We shouldn't have to spend $2million a year, on false teachings, when parent's are just as capable as teaching their children. As for the immorality portion, I did not just say parent's are uncomfrtable with the exercises, but also children. My opponent then goes to make a sensless, comparisson between Gluten, and Sex. Sex should not be taught at such a young age, because kids will become curious, and want to try things, which will take their focus off of school, wheras Gluten doesn't have the same effect, unless you have some...wierd fetish. Conclusion: Pro has failed to show us why parent's are uncapable of teaching their children sex education at home. I argued that sex edu is a waste of money because 1. it's innefective and 2. parents are just as capable of teaching their own children. I have also show that onlt 18 out of 21 states are required for their teachings to be medically correct. Why would we fund programs, that aren't even teaching a program correctly? This is how mistakes are made. Parent's are just as, if not, more capable of teaching their own children. Vote Con! Sources: [1] http://www.telegraph.co.uk... [2] http://www.truth-out.org...

51	S878e2e96-Ad5c150d3	0	2	Do we need sex education in schools?	Single Sex Schools Are Good for Education.	"I, as a high school student too, know very well the meaning of Education. But we are not talking about education. We are talking about the impact of being educated in a Single sex school. You yourself have agreed that school is for making people educated. Exactly, its just not book based learning, its even moral based learning that makes you ready for the real world. By making educating students in an environment in which they will be able to indulge with the other gender, what you're doing is making them ready for the REAL world. Isn't that what school is all about? Hindering the learning process? You're not hindering any process, you're merrily making them learn to ADJUST to different environments. Like I have already said, nobody is going to make a student feel comfortable later on life. It may seem ""hindering"" but what single sex schools are doing is hindering the child's future by making it hard for them later. It is because we are learning to be ready for the future that we go to learn in schools yes? Because everyone wants a bright future. ""There are many people over the years that have gone to Boy's or Girl's only schools. To my knowledge, there are not usually any major issues with people after they are into the workforce."" -Well, some students might easily adapt to their workplace later on in life, but there are many more who will feel awkward or maybe just not comfortable mingling with the other sex because they have been secluded in an environment in which there has been only ONE gender. Single sex schools might give the right education and all that. But they're not giving the life skills required for the child. And in a workplace, life skills that includes, learning to work with others, play a major role. School life makes up just 14-15 years of an individuals life. You cannot afford to make a person feel ""comfortable"" for just those years and make it difficult for them to adapt later on in the major years after school life. Single-sex education is ineffective, misguided and may actually increase gender stereotyping, because in these schools where single sex education is prevalent neither sex would be easily able to accept gender differences. Not only that, it doesn't allow either of the sexes to interact and creates a virtual barrier between the two. It is funny how girls can be distraction for you. Later on, girls might be working with you, you might be asked to spear a project with the other gender, you cannot call them a ""distraction"" and not do the job, can you? Being in a Co-Ed school, it will be much easier for you to do the job, because you wouldn't be shy or feeling different since you have already spent your school life with other gender. I'm not stating that Co-ed schools are the best, even it has cons, but I'm just stating that Co-Ed schools are much better for a child's growth overall. I respect your opinions and thoughts. Thank you very much for taking part in this debate!"	CON	need sex education schools	need sex education school
67	S3cb7f0d9-A7fbc726f	2	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Pick your debate - 4/5 topics	"Thanks Vi. Pro seems to accept that terrorism can include (in her words) ""the struggle of people for determination, or revolution, or rebellion"" as well as that ""Occasionally it can even be the most practical [but never reasonable] way to achieve such ends."" In any case she has not disputed these assertions. I think these are potentially strong justifications for terrorism in response to extreme oppression. I said: ""Terrorism can include these things"" [ as listed by Vi ""fear mongering, propaganda, kidnapping and murder"" ] ""but it no more implies or necessarily includes any of them than it does the struggle for rebellion."" Vi said: ""As we can see, the definition of terrorism directly contradicts this. Terrorism either directly puts innocent people in harms way or disregards their safety completely."" I don't see the contradiction here and I think my response to Vi's emotive opening argument still stands. ____ Pro:""my opponent assumes that if someone can irrationally talk themselves into justifying immoral behavior, it must be ok. I can talk myself into believing that dragons exist, but real evidence points to the contrary."" ""For something to be justified, it must be objectively just - it can not be only ""interpreted"" as just by a mind. Minds reason through things irrationally all of the time. It would not be immoral to rape an innocent woman if we threw the term ""justified"" as a subjective term that the perpetrator can use in any way he pleases to call his action ""just."" Also, you do not need to be clinically ""insane"" in order to commit an immoral and unjust act."" The last thing I want to do is make this a debate based off semantics but I think there is a clear distinction between something being inherently and objectively just and something being able to be logically justified to a rational (if misinformed) mind. I think the use of the verb in the resolution makes this implication, otherwise the resolution would be ""terrorism can never be just"" or ""terrorism is always unjust"". I don't think it can be compared to rape because I don't see how that could rationally be defended on ideological grounds. Perhaps if a group of militant lesbians were to target known serial rapists and subject them to hideous forced anal violations, then maybe rape could be justified. I'm sorry for the confusion as well about the issue of rationality. I'm not arguing about justifying something to the insane or the irrational, that was my point. I'm talking about the rare instances where a rational person can make a clear minded decision that an act of violence is likely to bring greater benefit and more long term peace and that the ultimate loss of innocent life will be less in the long term because of it. Suppose that a group of German terrorists had been able to plant a bomb in Hitler's home during the first months of World War II. If they were willing to harm his family and his live-in house staff in order to carry out such an attack then it would qualify as terrorism rather than mere assassination. Such an act would be inexcusable if taken on its own but viewed in the wider context of the harm this man was intent on inflicting, I would consider this justifiable. Or imagine that you are an ANC or IRA activist planting a device within a military compound. These soldiers have been oppressing you and your people in your own land for decades and you are making a just strike back at them. You can justify the non-combatant casualties because in the case of the trainees, these will soon become hostile soldiers themselves and even the catering and cleaning staff are oiling the machinery for the regime of oppression. These are all realistic, historical examples of times when terrorism could have been justified, it would be all too easy to back up my argument further with hypothetical extreme circumstances where the justification would be even stronger. ______ ""Killing of innocent people is never just. Taking an innocent life is always immoral and unjust, no matter the circumstances. One may say it is for the greater good - and yes, greater good may come from it, but it does not negate the immoral and unequal treatment of that life taken."" I agree that taking innocent lives is always wrong but as I have shown above, in some situations it can be justified such as if the benefit (innocent lives saved) outweighs the cost (innocent lives taken). I would also point out that the definition of terrorism does not specify targeting or disregarding the safety of ""the innocent"" but rather of ""non-combatants"". While I am not suggesting that medical or administrative military personnel should be legitimate targets, I don't think they can be described as ""innocent"" in the same way as for example, a baby can. There are surely many individuals not bearing arms who are culpable for acts deserving punishment, such as politicians who vote in favour of an unjust war. Sorry about this but: Suppose that someone murders your entire family and everyone you love in front of you. You try to get justice through the courts but the murderer has a bunch of respectable cronies who all give him a watertight alibi (even though they know he did it) and he is found innocent. You are filled with justified murderous rage and your only hope is to extract revenge yourself. One day your opportunity to destroy him finally comes (after decades of seething in prison with everyone thinking that you murdered your loved ones yourself) but it will also involve murdering two of the guys that gave him an alibi. Now if they were truly innocent you probably wouldn't feel right doing it, but are they? Just because they didn't do the killing themselves? I think you'd be justified to take all three of them down. Maybe. _______ I am glad to know that my opponent does not exclude acts of war from the definition of terrorism. I couldn't be sure from her previous argument where she seemed to place great emphasis on the distinctions between them. She states that ""It doesn't matter which wars I believe were just or not"" but as I was asserting that virtually all wars inevitably lead to some disregard for the safety of non-combatants I think this is an important point. Unless my opponent is willing to also condemn the vast majority of wars this century (I would like to be knowledgeable enough to say ""all"") then her insistence that taking innocent lives is unjust holds little weight. Once again any source detailing a war with zero non-combatant casualties would be very much welcomed. My opponent has condemned as terrorism the fire-bombing of German cities, the atomic bombings in Japan and America's 'shock and awe' tactics in Iraq. I'm sure that many members of this site will view at least one of these occurrences as justified within the wider picture of events at the time. The issue of Hiroshima is a debate in itself but this essay starts with the arguments against it before justifying it within the historical context. http://docs.google.com... The site I linked in my argument that the firebombings in Germany qualified as terrorism is also part of a detailed article on justifying terrorism, Michael Walzer makes an excellent argument that the first of these bombings were justified. http://plato.stanford.edu...

67	S160b94ce-A724e87af	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism can be justified	"Thanks for the debate social.social's argument rests on several argumentative moves: (1) limit the discussion to cases that involve a ""just war,"" (2) blur the JWT's combatant/non-combatant distinction by redefining civilians as combatants, and (3) use (2) to represent all government actions as the unfiltered ""will of the people embodied."" I will present three challenges to these points: (1) terrorism is not a ""just"" means to pursue a war, (2) the JWT's combatant/non-combatant distinction strictly distinguishes between the status of civilians and combatants during war, and (3) civilians should not be held accountable for the actions of elected officials.Just War TheoryAs social points out, in Just War Theory there is a distinction between jus ad bellus - whether the war is justified - and jus in bellum - whether the means used to carry it out are justified. Thus, not every means is justified in the pursuit of a just end. I maintain that terrorism is never justified because it is an inherently unjust means, even if it is directed toward a just goal. The reason terrorism cannot be justified is because it intentionally kills non-combatants. For example, it is sometimes permissible to do things in war that kill non-combatants as a side-effect, but it is not permissible to kill non-combatants as the intended effect in and of itself.The reason for this is straight-forward - non-combatants do not pose a threat. The purpose of terrorism is thus to create fear and terror in a nation by intentionally killing people who do not pose a threat. According to Just War Theory (social's chosen framework), this is an impermissible means to carry out a war, even if the war is justified. In effect, terrorism undermines the order necessary for a civil society by creating panic in the lives of non-combatants.There is yet another problem with using terrorism as a means to carry out a war. It rests on a slippery slope that can quickly lead a government to turn on its own citizens. If the intentional targeting of non-combatants can be justified, who is to say a government cannot target its own citizens to achieve some political goal during war? This would be unacceptable, yet the logic that permits terrorism is the same logic that would permit the government to target its own non-threatening citizens.Re: ""Contention. Civilians are indirectly responsible for the acts of their country's military.""(A) Taxes and financial support.social argues that citizens who pay taxes are ""morally responsible"" for wars. The problem with this argument is that it ignores the reason combatants lose their right to life in the first place: because they directly threaten the lives of others. The point is, non-combatants are by definition non-threatning, so they retain their right to life. The paying of taxes does not directly pose a threat to anyone, so even if an argument could be made that citizens are morally responsible for wars waged in their name, it still does not justify the killing of people who retain their right to life because they are non-threatning.There is another counter-argument to social's contention. This argument says, because acts of war are not permitted unless they are necessary, the intentional targeting of non-combatants is never permissible because it is never necessary. I highlight the word intentional because it is the key to this entire argument: it may sometimes be necessary to kill non-combatants as a side-effect to another military operation, but intentionally killing non-combatants in and of itself to achieve a goal is never necessary.(B) Democracy and Civic Representationsocial argues that the government is ""posited as the will of the people embodied,"" so therefore, citizenry ""cannot be defended as morally innocent"" in the matter of going to war. The arguments from above - that non-combatants do not pose a direct threat and that intentionally killing non-combatants is never necessary - both apply here as well. But there is another argument to be made here as well. The government does not always express the will of the people (and in the case of war, it almost never express the will of all people), so civilians should not be held accountable for the actions of elected officials.As social mentioned, we are talking about a liberal (representative) democracy. This means that if someone gets a majority of the vote, even if it is 40% of the vote (less than half the people in the nation), the official gets elected. This suggests that the government does not necessarily represent the will of the people, as it is possible for the government to represent only 40% or 30% of the people because of the system we use to elect officials. This is inevitable in any democratic nation, as a majority of the vote does not guarantee a true majority when it comes to what the people want regarding war. If a government goes to war, but it only represents a minority view, then there is no reason to hold the citizenry as a whole morally responsible. But even if the majority view was that the war was justified, it does not change the fact that there will be people who do not think the war is justified. Those people are a counter-exampe to social's argument."	CON	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

67	S3cb7f0d9-Ab738a266	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Pick your debate - 4/5 topics	"Thanks again Vi, for the opportunity to debate such an interesting topic with such a skilled debater as yourself. Just to clarify for everyone, as I am Con and my opponent is Pro, we have agreed that the resolution we are debating is: TERRORISM CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIED. ______________ I will respond to my opponent's case before presenting my own. Pro:""Terrorism is not the struggle of people for determination, or revolution, or rebellion."" Correct. We have an excellent definition for what terrorism is already. However, while it is not synonymous with struggles such as these it does not exclude them either. Occasionally it can even be the most practical and reasonable way to achieve such ends. Pro:""Terrorism is cowardly fear mongering, propaganda, kidnapping and murder to scare a government or a people into submission."" Terrorism can include these things but it no more implies or necessarily includes any of them than it does the struggle for rebellion. Pro: ""The blatant disregard for human life that terrorists adhere to ... is unethical and therefore unjust."" Viewed in isolation any such act is indeed unjust but in certain circumstances the killing of innocents is often justified on the premise that it will prevent a greater evil. My opponent's subsequent arguments regarding war all seem to disregard the clear fact that wars always end up killing 'innocent' people. Pro: ""It all comes down to one key statement: It is unethical to do harm to an innocent human being, no matter what the motivator."" I personally find it hard to disagree with this statement but the fact is that we often justify our unethical actions. If there was no question of an act being unethical then there would be no point attempting to justify it. If my opponent truly wishes to build her argument around this ""key statement"" then she has basically invalidated most of the distinctions she makes between war and terrorism. Wars kill civilians almost without exception and I would love to see a source detailing a war in which voluntary combatants were the only people harmed. My opponent goes on to stress the differences between war and terrorism and she is of course correct in pointing out the many guidelines and conventions which exist to regulate ethical conduct in war. None of this however alters the fact that many conventionally justified military actions fall under the definition of terrorism my opponent has provided: Systematic, ideological, intending to create fear and disregarding the safety of civilians. I will be giving some specific examples in my own arguments. I would be interested if my opponent could provide some idea of which wars she considers just or unjust so that we can see how they measure up to her ""key statement"" above. I agree that ""Poverty is not the root cause of terrorism"" although I think it can often be a contributing factor. I think terrorism is wide ranging and has a variety of causes, some more justifiable than others. Pro: ""One can never claim justice by destroying a fundamental human right."" That is precisely what happens in the majority of wars, which my opponent apparently thinks are justified. As I think I mentioned before, people usually justify these kinds of seemingly unethical actions by appealing to the concept of 'the greater good'. Lastly, I won't dispute that ""terrorism is a means of coercion"" but I don't understand how that is really relevant as many forms of coercion are conventionally justified; from disciplining students to threatening employees with the sack if they don't work hard enough. In response to the Rand stuff I would bring up Marx's concept of economic coercion, if it were not way off topic. ___________ My position: Terrorism can sometimes be justified. Although this may seem like quite a controversial position, I think there are a number of ways to argue it. Firstly to show that something can be justified, I don't really need to show that something is objectively just, or believe it to be just myself, merely that it could potentially be interpreted as just by a rational mind. People engaging in acts of terrorism have generally justified it to themselves and they often have many supporters. While some may be insane and entirely devoid of reasoning, I don't think its possible that they all are. Secondly I could present a slew of hypothetical examples of ridiculously extreme situations where terrorism would be the only reasonable option. I think that both of these would be a bit of a cop out though and too easy, so I won't use them (not this round anyway, though I may fall back on them if Vi starts kicking my butt lol). Instead I'm simply going to present a few examples. First of acts of war that are generally justified by most western citizens, I will be explaining how all of these fit our definition of terrorism. Then a few examples of 'terrorist' groups, some of the actions of whom I feel can be justified to a certain extent. _____ War = Terrorism These examples are all from recent history and most are from World War II, which most people consider to be among the most just of wars because of the greater evil presented by the fascist regimes. 1. The firebombing of Dresden and other German cities. ""[F]or more than three years, the RAF, later joined by the USAAF, deliberately devastated many German cities, killed about 600,000 civilians and seriously injured another million in an attempt to terrorize the German people into forcing their leadership to halt the war and surrender unconditionally."" http://plato.stanford.edu... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.amazon.co.uk... This was systematic and deliberately targeted civilians to coerce them through fear towards an ideological goal. Although particularly the later bombings when the outcome of the war was pretty certain have often been criticised, this terror campaign has been and will continue to be justified by many. 2. Hiroshima and Nagasaki. ""On August 6, 1945, the United States used a massive, atomic weapon against Hiroshima, Japan. This atomic bomb, the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT, flattened the city, killing tens of thousands of civilians. While Japan was still trying to comprehend this devastation three days later, the United States struck again, this time, on Nagasaki."" http://history1900s.about.com... I can think of no clearer example for our definition of terrorism than these bombings yet most people would agree they were needed to win a just war. 3. Shock and awe in Iraq. http://www.cbsnews.com... The lessons of the past were applied here against the Iraqi civilians. There was no consideration for innocent life. Shock and awe is basically a euphemism for terrorism as a military strategy. _______ Terrorism = justified. I'm incredibly short of letters now but briefly: 1. IRA Although they went on to commit many unjustifiable and barbaric acts (such as bombing my city), the original Irish Republican Army fought horrific oppression from England and many of their actions are viewed as just by Irish, American and even English people. http://www.rateitall.com... 2. ANC I can't say I support every action they took but like most people, I think the ANC were the 'good guys' in apartheid ridden South Africa. The status former member Nelson Mandela has as a world statesman confirms this widely held opinion. Recently a UK MP came out in support of the ANC's terrorist activities. http://www.therightperspective.org... Sorry for brevity of examples I must learn to use the character limits better. I look forward to round 3. Thanks."	CON	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	S1e7176c9-Adb667ac4	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	The United States government commits acts of terrorism	A lot of people believe that the United States is a sponsor or itself perpetrates terrorism. They cite various actions or atrocities carried out by the United States military, the CIA, or allied entities. I do not believe the United States can be characterized as a terrorist state. This topic is potentially very sticky, since people hold ambiguous definitions and feelings about terrorism. I stand by the definition that terrorism is a violent act intentionally inflicted against innocent civilians for the purpose of swaying a third party, usually a government, to change its behavior. The use of violence in itself doesn't define terrorism, nor do the goals of the assailant matter. The actions of the target government that might inspire a terrorist act aren't a concern either. The key point to defining terrorism is that violence is used against innocents in order to sway the actions of a third, responsible party. This is particularly onerous to those who want to live by the rule of law because it places authorities in an unpleasant dilemma: they either submit to demands and thereby validate the use of illegal force to achieve change, or allow for the loss of innocent life to preserve the integrity of the rule of law. The United States has not intentionally or consistently employed the coercive actions of terrorism to achieve its goals. It has used military force and the threat of force against other states, but only in a lawful framework. It is not acceptable to conflate war with terrorism, especially considering the above definition. With respect to individuals or people groups, the United States has made mistakes in its history, such as condoning slavery and failing to uphold treaties with Native Americans, but these were simply by definition not acts of terrorism. In war, atrocities have been committed and collateral casualties have been incurred, but neither of these were intentionally or coherently inflicted as a matter of policy. Furthermore, as unfortunate as these acts were, they weren't terrorism. Terrorism only occurs when a threat or attack is aimed specifically against civilians in order to sway the target government's actions. The Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 was terrorism because the perpetrators wanted the U.S. federal government to cease what they considered tyranny. Another clear-cut example is the July 2005 London bombings, because Al Qaeda affiliates wanted Britain to withdraw from Iraq. Many actions are onerous. Some are just unpleasant, and people can rightfully disagree as to their moral legitimacy. Not all these things are terrorism, however. People are rightfully frustrated by the excessive use of the term, but the specific meaning of terrorism is important to understand and maintain, and it must not be lost.

67	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind. This kind of sacrifice makes us heroic; This kind of sacrifice is nee"	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	Sab66897e-Ac6ad53d3	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism can be justified.	Terrorism is, like Pro already told us, the use of violence for political ends, ignoring the human rights. So basically, terrorist ignores humans rights for the sake of their own benefit.Human rights are sacred. No one can determine which rights we can have and which we can, because right are natural. Every person that attempts against human rights, no matter the reason, is attempting against human nature, and thus can't be considered human. There's no situation in which ignoring human rights is justified. Human rights are part of the human nature. When we ignore them, we ignore our humanness. Terrorism is not a human action, but a beast's action.I understand minorities want to express themselves. However, saying terrorism is the only way they can express is lazy, and rather a way of masquerading sadism. Minorities can express in a pacific way. In doing so they would have the opportunity of making their voices sound without having to negate the humanity to people. Someone could say it is not an effective way, but they would be lying. There are several examples throughout history that pacific manifestations are effective. For instance, the movement leaded by Ghandi.As well as this, terrorism is counterproductive. Terrorist acts don't cause people to rethink their conception of that expressing minority. Instead, they generate more hate and a desire for revenge. If someone throws you a rock, you don't start to listen to what he has to say. You go and return the attack. Is this good? That's debatable, but what no one can refute is that it is the human tendency.Finally, wars always violate human rights. Wars are damaging and immoral. But at least there's some regulation to them. The Geneva Conventions give wars some sense of fairness, they make wars a bit less bad. But terrorism doesn't even care of this conventions. If wars are unjustifiable, then terrorism is worst than that.Terrorism is just another way of violating human rights. Anyone who accept and tries to justify terrorism is an immoral, because he/she is accepting the violating of human nature.	CON	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

Terrorism can be justified	In this debate I will be defending the thesis that terrorism can in some instances be justified and that there is nothing logically or definitionally prohibiting it from ever being a justifiable course of action. My burden will be to advance and defend an argument in support of my thesis. My opponent will take the opposite view and their burden in this debate will be to disprove my argument.===Definitions===There are a great deal of mutually incompatible definitions of terrorism so I will define it simply here. Terrorism is defined as the deliberate use of violence against non-combatants or civilians in the pursuit of some political goal.The term justified will pose a problem if there is not some accepted standard of justification between my opponent and myself. In the interest of keeping this debate on topic and not having it focus more on what can count as justification, just war theory will be used as the general standard unless a compelling reason is provided supporting why some aspect of it may be bypassed.The generally accepted tenets of what constitutes just war include conditions regarding the acceptable reasons to go to war as well as the acceptable ways in which to wage it, provided here[1].===Rules===1.

67	S2e622399-A92951c27	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Islam Is a Religion of Terrorism	"I. What does Islam mean? ""Islam is a verbal noun originating from the triliteral root s-l-m which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, completion and bonding/joining. In a religious context it means 'voluntary submission to God'.""[1] ""The Arabic word 'Islam' simply means 'submission', and derives from a word meaning 'peace'.""[2] Islam means peace and submission to God. Peace is one of the most important of Islam's II. What did Muhammad say? ""The prophet Muhammad said, 'Do not kill women or children or non-combatants and do not kill old people or sick people'.""[3] ""Prophet Muhammad said there is no excuse for committing unjust acts: 'Do not be people without minds of your own, saying that if others treat you well you will treat them well, and that if they do wrong you will do wrong to them. Instead, accustom yourselves to do good if people do good and not to do wrong (even) if they do evil.'""[4] ""The Prophet Muhammad also prohibited the killing of non-Muslims who have a peace treaty with the Muslims. He said: 'He who kills a non-Muslim (who has a peace treaty) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise, and its smell is sensed from a distance as far as forty years journey.' Even in the battlefield, the Prophet gave strict instructions and outlawed the killing of non-combatants and innocent civilians. He said: 'Fight in the name of God, but do not kill old men, children and women...'""[5] Muhammad did not advocate for useless killing and in fact spared the people of modern day Mecca even though those people had slaughtered thousands of his followers. This act alone proves that Islam is peaceful. III. What did Abu Bakr say? ""Abu Bakr a close companion and successor (Caliph) of the prophet whilst giving instructions to his army general said: 'I command you not to do ten things, do not kill women, do not kill children, do not kill the elderly, do not destroy trees, do not destroy properties, do not slaughter animals unless it is for food, neither flood or set fire to palm trees, avoid extremism, and do not act cowardly or weak.'""[5] ""The final instructions he gave to Usaama {Radiyallaahu'anhu} prescribed a code of conduct in war which remains unsurpassed to this day. Part of his instructions to the Muslim army were: 'Do not be deserters, nor be guilty of disobedience Do not kill an old man, a woman or a child. Do not injure date palms and do not cut down fruit trees. Do not slaughter any sheep or cows or camels except for food. You will encounter persons who spend their lives in monasteries. Leave them alone and do not molest them.'[6] Abu Bakr was the main follower of Muhammad, and basically continued to preach in his tradition. His words also signify thr peacefulness of Islam. IV. What does the Qur'an say? ""Goodness and evil are not equal. Repel evil with what is better. Then that person with whom there was hatred, may become your intimate friend! And no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint, none but people of the greatest good fortune. Quran 41:34-35""[7] ""The Qur'an, Islam's revealed text, states: ""Whoever kills a person [unjustly]…it is as though he has killed all mankind. And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved all mankind."" (Qur'an, 5:32)""[4] ""'For this reason, We decreed for the children of Israel that whoever kills a person- unless it is for murder or for spreading mischief in the land- it would be as if he has killed the whole of humankind, and whoever saves the life of a person it is as if he has saved the life of the whole of humankind. Our Messengers have already come to them with the clear signs; then many of them thereafter commit excesses in the earth' [al-Qur'an: 5: 32]""[5] ""'Fight in the way of God against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! God loveth not aggressors.' (Qur'an 2:190)""[8] ""'If [non-Muslims] withdraw from you and do not war against you and offer you peace, God alloweth you no way to [to war] against them.' (Quran 4:90)""[8] The Qur'an does not advocate for killing innocent civilians in any way same of form. In fact, it is preached that those who do will suffer the eternal torture of hell. The Qur'an also specifically states that those who repent should be saved and fully redeemed. V. What is Jihad? ""But jihad has very positive connotations in the Islamic world. It is akin to religious duty: when someone wants to better themselves, they embark on a jihad. Whether it's to quit smoking, pray more, and in some cases, fight off anyone preventing them from practicing their religion.""[9] ""Al-Ghazali captured the essence of Jihad when he said: ""The real Jihad is the warfare against (one's own) passions. Dr. Ibrahim Abu-Rabi calls Jihad ""the execution of effort against evil in the self and every manifestation of evil in society."" In a way, Jihad is the Muslim's purest sacrifice: a struggle to live a perfect life and completely submit to God.""[10] ""Similarly, in the Quran, we are told to invite people to God's message with wisdom and kind englightenment (Quran 16:125). The word ""jihad"" (Arabic) simply means to strive. For example, in Quran 9:79 it speaks of those who are charitable, as striving (Arabic noun: juh'dahum; derived from ""jihad""). A negative form of ""jihad"" is referred to in 29:8, where one's (misguided) parents may strive (again derived from ""jihad"") to convince a child about idol-worship. The verse speaks of it being permissable to disobey one's parents in such cases (the general Quranic commandment is to honor one's parents), and to be devoted to God Alone. The previous verses (29:5-7) also speak of striving for God, for our own good. There is no warfare implied.""""Striving in the cause of God, may include fighting in self-defense (9:41-44, 9:81). However, this is only in the case of war. Historically at the time of Muhammad, the submitters (muslims) were under attack from the idolatrous tribes of Arabia who saw the message of monotheism as a threat to their way of life. All of Muhammad's wars were in self-defense, not aggression. The point to be emphasized here, is that the Quran forbids aggression of any kind. In today's day and age most countries provide freedom of religion. Thus, there is no present context in which striving will include fighting a ""war"".""""The religion of Islam condemns the killing or even the persecution of people merely because they embrace a different religion. The Quran mandates the absolute freedom of religion in a society. It does not allow Muslims to fight except for self-defense and to enforce peace. It does not allow restrictions on those who disagree on religious matters. It urges the Muslims to treat such people kindly and equitably""[11] Jihad is literally translated as a ""struggle"". Warfare against other religions should not be involved because it is condoned in the Qur'an. Jihad when translated correctly is being better in your worship of God. Conclusion: Islam itself means peace and voluntary submission to Allah. The Qur'an states on many occasions that killing or harming innocent civilians, even of other religions, is against the will of Allah. Both Muhammad and Abu Bakr confirm this. The wars they fought were for the voluntary spread of Islam. The conquered peoples were still allowed to keep their own religions. And the treated the peoples with extreme kindness, even if they had not. And jihad means just a closer realtonship to Allah. Peace through Allah. Sources: [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org...

67	Sab66897e-Ab2142e09	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism can be justified.	Firstly, there were given two definitions of terrorism, one a broad definition and a narrow definition (refer to round 2, main arguments, argument for Pro, line 17-29), as a way of explaining how terrorism can be looked upon. If one was to refer to the broad definition, terrorism would indeed be ignoring basic human rights, but not only would “terrorists” be accusable, but the states of the world too. This would result in the word “terrorism” losing its ability to point out a group of people causing terror directed against states through the means of violence against innocents, but instead be liable to be used against any country if it were to break any human rights (which surprisingly many countries do.) If the narrower definition was used, terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and IS would stand to be accountable for acts of terrorism, whilst freedom fighters targeting their state and not the innocent people of their country, would not be put into the same ranks as what then some would describe as “real terrorist groups”. Secondly, human rights may be a right to most citizens of the world, but some states still suppress their citizens and take away their rights. In these countries, if all other means of peaceful negotiation or of the sort were to be dismissed and ignored, what other means would the citizens of the country be left with? These are extreme cases and rightly so, violence is never a good choice, but it may sometimes be the only choice that is left. Minorities in most countries are heard and terrorism is by far not the only option they have to be heard, terrorism was to be the last resort under a rule actively suppressing them for the benefit of the majority. As said above terrorism, or rather violence against the state using the narrow definition was to only be used in the most extreme cases where all peaceful choices were deemed futile. Indeed terrorism may be a lazy method of expression, but if it is the only method to get an international voice to call for assistance, it is a method better than giving in and accepting being suppressed. It is true that terrorism can spark hate among people and cause attention being put onto it, but have it then not done what it was supposed to do? Resistance and freedom fighters are not trying to tell the system that they are doing it wrong, it is well beyond that at that point. Their goal is international attention, as states have the influence and power to manipulate the citizens and cover up so the rest of the world cannot follow alongside what is happening, freedom fighters must resort to, once again, the extreme choice of terrorism, although preferably using the narrow definition, violence. Wars are never a good option; it is well beyond terrorism, as most states commits acts of war during wartime could be considered acts of terrorism as well, using the broad definition. Today’s wars are not so much wars as they used to, but rather special undercover operations, such as Operation Neptune Spear, the operation that resulted in the killing of Osama bin Laden. It is true that these Operations are regulated, but with Neptune Spear it does not seem as much as an act of war, except if you deem the United States’ war on terrorism a “real” war. Anyways the discussion, though very enjoyable, was not about wars and beginning to define wars too would be pointless as the debate is about terrorism. Thank you.

67	S7d308fe6-A6edbf0f4	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Legitimacy	Terrorism is never justified. Peaceful and democratic means must always be used. If this cannot happen inside the state, there are international courts such as the International Criminal Court in the The Hague, which handle cases such as war crimes and oppression. Even when democratic rights are denied, non-violent protest is the only moral action. And in the most extreme cases, in which subject populations are weak and vulnerable to reprisals from the attacked state, it is especially important for groups not to resort to terror. Terrorism merely exacerbates a situation, and creates a cycle of violence and suffering.	CON	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

This House Believes that Terrorism can be Justified	"Well done, you managed to find a person, an amazing person, ONE person to justify your argument that the ""end justifies the means"". However where is he end? When will this end. As I said before (which you did not reply to), if we keep using violence it would just keep on going in an endless cycle. As for saying that terrorism can be justified by the terrorists is true but if that is the case what is the point of the debate? We might as well just say everyone has their own vies on justification and leave it at that. Also, by stating this you are also saying that murder can be justified, so can rape or kidnapping, which connects to terrorism and all can be justified by the person that commits the acts. However, surely the person that commits the act is not right to justify themselves? It's like how we don't let criminals to vote, why do you think that is?"

67	S657f4fee-A21d9e4c0	0	0	Can terrorism be justified?	Story Challenge: Moat Maiden	"I would like to introduce an exercise (story challenge) in which PRO and CON incrementally develop what, in the end, becomes an interactive short story. This is probably best explained through an example. After the example are a few parameters, to which compliance is implicit in accepting this ""debate"". Following that, I present the Round 1 opening to Moat Maiden. Note that the rounds can be brief. Think Groo meets MacGyver. -- Noel Leon /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 1 -------------------- This is not quite a safari, in not quite a canoe. For my budget river rafting, a kayak has to do. From origin to terminus, I'd paddle fast and free. That was until around the bend, got stuck in this eddy. The vortex spins my river craft, yet grips it fast in place. To sink for lack of towing force, to vanish without trace. 1 The kayak is spinning. The compass is spinning. My head is spinning. And all the counter-paddling to put an end to this spinning is very tiring. What is the best first step? Swim to rocks and climb > Swim into the cave at the river bend Paddle more furiously Reason: Already tired from fighting the current, the cave seems to be the closest refuge for rest. Result: Swimming through the eddy, I enter the cave and clamber onto a rock. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 1 -------------------- 2 Development: There, while panting for breath, I give the cavern a cursory glance and see evidence of inhabitation. > Eat the charred food in fire-pit Wrap myself in the bearskin beside the fire Venture further into the cave Reason: No doubt the protein will provide needed energy. Result: Anyway, whatever it was, it tasted like chicken. Instinctively licking my fingers, I extend them to the fire-pit. /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 2 -------------------- 3 Development: Flame flickers between the stacked logs, providing a modicum of radiant heat. Run up and down a nearby rock outcrop to warm up Return to kayak for a change of clothes > Shift the front log with the stick Reason: Removing the front log exposes the hottest glowing region. Result: This increased infrared radiation soon dries my clothing. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 2 -------------------- 4 Development: The firelight also reveals a stack of rocks like stairs at a far end of the cavern and shifting shadows on the near side of the cave. Go toward the light > Listen for footfalls Run to the kayak Reason: Shadows suggest a possible intruder. Result: Actually, I would be the intruder to the cave dweller who ambles in, apparently without detecting me. /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 3 -------------------- 5 Development: The cave dweller falls asleep in the bearskin at mouth of cave. Run to the kayak Talk with the cave dweller > Tip-toe to the outcropping Reason: With the front entrance blocked, the only other exit may be up the stack of rocks. Result: At the top of the sedimentary staircase is a thatch mat. Tossing back the covering of straw and sticks, I catch a glimpse of the dweller catching a glimpse of me. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 3 -------------------- 6 Development: With renewed energy, I heave myself up and onto an embankment. On the other side of the river is a tree hut. Beat chest and shout like Tarzan Leap into the Ruddy River > Swing on the dangling vine Reason: Vine travel worked for Tarzan and might work for me. Result: Kicking off the rock holding the inclined vine, I grab on and swing over the river. /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 4 -------------------- 7 Development: To prevent the dweller doing likewise, I have presence of mind to keep hold of the vine, which now dangles down to the forest floor. My presence at the hut upsets some chimps, however. They throw coconuts and, yikes, feces. Throw some (coconuts) back Pretend to eat a banana > Slide down the vine Reason: The vine dangling to the ground offers rapid escape, much like a fire fighter sliding down a station-house pole. Result: I land beside the river, just out of reach of the eddy-entrapped kayak. Some simians projectiles, mostly vine and coconuts, have preceded me. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 4 -------------------- 8 Development: Simian screeches are getting louder as they reposition. I don't want to grapple with an excrement attack. Make a coconut slingshot with vine Jump into river and swim to kayak > Grapple with a coconut and vine instead Reason: A broken coconut tied to a vine makes an adequate grappling hook. Result: Like a cowpoke with a restless lasso, I swing it around and drop the coconut in the kayak. Development: Pulling the craft out of the eddy and to shore, I am soon safely bearing down-current. \------------------------------ End of Example ------------------------------/ Here are the parameters mentioned. PRO Round 1 introduces the verse and first situation. The verse sets the role and goal (e.g., jungle river rafter / free kayak from eddy). Each situation develops the story in first-person perspective to the point of three choices, identifies the best choice and reason why it is best based on clues in the story, and then gives the result of selecting that option. PRO and CON collaborate in creating credible predicaments paced so that the solution comes naturally (without a great leap of plot) as the development in CON Round 4. PRO and CON compete (try to win the ""debate"") by composing situations that are more interesting, evenly paced, and intriguing than those composed by his or her adversary. The aim is not to trip up the other author (e.g., with abrupt or inconsistent transitions), but to contribute more compelling content through cohesive narrative and clever puzzle-making. OK, on to PRO Round 1 of the story that we will develop. This is the first of three story challenges. All take place with a vaguely medieval level of technology. 1: Moat Maiden. In a clearing in an otherwise dense forest. Here, a square moat surrounds a cottage. 2: Cottage Cart. Crossing the moat, in the cottage the maiden sits beside a stack of woven cloth. 3: Snow Stopper (might be called Court Yarn). In the village courtyard, the Reeve seeks aid in preventing an avalanche. ~~~ MOAT MAIDEN ~~~ Help me, cries the angry maiden, across the murky moat. Vandals destroyed the old footbridge, and even stole my boat. Don't try to jump or even vault, its far too wide to leap. Ten paces wide on every side, and icy water deep. Perhaps there is a strong ladder, to use as if a bridge. Careful of the alligators, below the slimy ridge. 1 The maiden pleas but is otherwise unhelpful and here I've nothing but an empty sack. A nearby wooden shed is a weathered shell of its former self. What is the best first step? Climb the apple tree for a better vantage Follow the flickering light from copse to the north > Peek inside nearby shed, weathered shell of its former self Reason: Whatever raw materials are around, that shed might contain tools for crafting them. Result: A cursory survey, however, reveals only a rusted long-handled shovel, a hefty plank about 1 pace by 8 paces, and an old boot recently the home of a rodent family."

67	Sbfb67452-A4b63c949	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Islam is not a religion of terrorism	"Thank you for accepting this debate challenge, and I'm looking forward to have this debate with you again.ArgumentsMy arguments will be almost the same as the ones I have at the previous debate with Microscuk on this topic. They will go like this:1) Prophet Muhammed against terrorism2) The Quran against terrorism3) What is Jihad and does it have anything to do with terrorism?Prophet Muhammed against terrorismMany examples can demonstrate the fact that prophet Muhammed was against terrorism. I will just give two of them. Giving just these two examples is enough to prove my point that prophet Muhammed was not someone who promoted terrorism, but someone who was against it.1) Some examples of the sayings of prophet Muhammed which is clearly against terrorism.Do not kill children. Avoid touching people who devote themselves to worship in churches! Never murder women and the elderly. Do not set trees on fire or cut them down. Never destroy houses. (Bukhãri)Allah is not kind to him who is not kind to people. (Muslim & Bukhari)A believer continues to guard his Faith (and thus hopes for Allah's Mercy) so long as he does not shed blood unjustly"". (Al-Bukhari)The first cases to be adjudicated between people on the Day of Judgment will be those of bloodshed. (Muslim and Al-Bukhari)There is a reward for kindness to every living animal or human. (Muslim and Al-Bukhari)Those who are kind and considerate to Allah's creatures, Allah bestows His kindness and affection on them. Show kindness to the creatures on the earth so that Allah may be kind to you. (Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi)Its clear from these sayings that prophet Muhammed was not a man who promoted terrorism. Someone who did, would never say things like this. And these sayings are just some of many more.2) When prophet Muhammed entered the town of Makkah with his huge army, the Quraysh people stood before him expecting him to kill them all. The Quraysh people had previously tortured him and his companions, exiled him and brutally killed his dearest relatives. They basically made a living hell for him. But what did the prophet Muhammed do? He forgave them all. Does this seem like a person of terrorism? Would someone who promoted terrorism do this? Clearly not.The Quran against terrorismThere are many verses in the Quran which clearly denounces terrorism. Let me give some of them.... if someone kills another person - unless it is in retaliation for someone else or for causing corruption in the earth - it is as if he had murdered all mankind. And if anyone gives life to another person, it is as if he had given life to all mankind. Our Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, but even after that many of them committed outrages in the earth. (Surat al-Ma'ida, 32)Why shouldn't you fight in the cause of Allah and for those oppressed because they are weak. Men, women and children who cry out, Our Lord! Rescue us from this town of oppressors. (Noble Quran 4:75)But as for those who break Allah's contract after it has been agreed and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and cause corruption in the earth, the curse will be upon them. They will have the Evil Abode. (Surat ar-Ra'd, 25) God does not forbid you from showing kindness and dealing justly with those who have not fought you about religion and have not driven you out of your homes, that you should show them kindness and deal justly with them. God loves just dealers."" (Noble Quran 60:8)Whenever he holds the upperhand, he goes about the earth corrupting it, destroying (people's) crops and breeding stock. Allah does not love corruption. When he is told to have fear of Allah, he is seized by pride which drives him to wrongdoing. Hell will be enough for him! What an evil resting-place. (Surat al-Baqara, 205-206)and let not the hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is next to piety; and fear Allah, for Allah is well-acquainted with all that you do."" (Noble Quran 5:8)If they seek peace, then seek you peace and trust in God for He is the Hearer, the Knower. (Noble Quran 8:61)As can be seen from the above verses, it is out of question for someone who fears Allah to do a terrorist act. The Quran clearly is against terrorism, as seen from these verses. Unfortunately, some people have picked some verses from the Quran and justified his terrorist actions by it. All those verses due, are just out of context. A Muslim who knows the Quran good, knows that it is against terrorism.What is Jihad and does it have anything to do with terrorism?Its a big misunderstanding on Jihad going on. The biggest misunderstanding on it, is that its meaning is ""Holy war"". This is completely wrong. You will not find in any place the word ""Holy war"" in the Quran, which means ""harbun muqaddasatu"" in arabic. The exact meaning of ""Jihad"" is ""effort"". Thus, in Islam, ""to carry out jihad"" is ""to show effort, to struggle"". Prophet Muhammad explained that ""the greatest jihad is the one a person carries out against his lower soul"". This means your desires and ambitions. The term Jihad is applied in many different forms. One of its forms is also war. Jihad can indeed be used in war. But Allah permitted Jihad in war only for defensive porpuses. Jihad does not have anything to do with terrorism, it simply just a self-defense. Jihad in Islam is striving in the way of God, by for example doing good deeds, propogate the message of Islam, making the hajj, and, if no other choice - with arms (using weapons in combat).The Quran is clear on the issue of war. For Muslims to participate in war there must be valid justifications, and strict conditions must be fulfilled. Muslims were allowed to wage war only because they were oppressed and subjected to violence. To put it in another way, Allah granted permission for war only for defensive purposes. And even when in war, there are many rules to be followed. You cannot for example kill children, women, the elderly, destroy houses, cut down trees etc. Jihad is also used to stop oppression. If there is oppression, the Muslims should fight those who created that oppression and then create peace.This is what the dictionary of Islam says about Jihad: '(1) Personal Struggle (in the way of Allah (God) to keep evil away from yourself) (2) Holy War (Fighting a fair, defensive war - to stop oppression.' [1]It should also be notet that Islam stricly forbids to force someone in believing in Islam. In the Quran, God says: Let there be no compulsion (or coercion) in the religion (Islam). The right direction is distinctly clear from error. (2:256)ConclusionIt is totally irrational to say that Islam is a religion of terrorism, when its foundations (i,c.. The Quran and the sayings of prophet Muhammad) clearly speaks against it, as seen above. Islam is not a religion of terrorism, but of peace. Even the word ""Islam"" itself is derived from the word ""Peace"". I have also shown that Jihad does not have anything to do with terrorism, and that war in Islam is only for defensive purposes or to stop oppressed. There is no such thing as a ""Holy war"" againt non-Muslims or that Muslims must rule the whole world and force everybody to become Muslims. This is the biggest lie in the history of mankind! It should also be noted that the term ""terrorism"" does not exist in the Quran or the teachings of prophet Muhammed. If the terms ""terrorist or terrorism"" are derived from a verb used in the Quran, such as 5:33 describing a ""Muslim's"" terrorist acts, it is in condemnation and prescribes a big punishment. In the light of the teachings of the Quran and the sayings of prophet Muhammed, we clearly and strongly can state:All acts of terrorism is forbidden in Islam, and also for a Muslim to cooperate with any individual or group that is involved in any act of terrorism or violence.Sources1. http://www.islamic-dictionary.com...2. http://www.searchtruth.com...3. www.aboutjihad.com 4. www.quran.com"	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

This House Believes that Terrorism can be Justified	"Well done, you managed to find a person, an amazing person, ONE person to justify your argument that the ""end justifies the means"". If you would go back to my definition of the debate, you will find that I stated that terrorism can only be justified when fighting back against an oppressive regime or society. Even if we totally discount my second argument (which is still entirely fair and you have actually agreed with), then by the definition terrorism can still be justified in these certain situations because of the pressured and unequal circumstances. This example was to back up my earlier point that in certain situations terrorism can be justified, something which you have not yet argued against or disproved. if we keep using violence it would just keep on going in an endless cycle Con does not seem to be getting the point of my arguments. Peaceful protests are all well and good, but sometimes they just aren't enough. Do you think that if America and England had peacefully fought back against Germany in WW2 we would still be in our rich and diverse world today? The harsh fact of life is that violence is needed sometimes, and that violence can be justified when the thing you are attacking is so repugnant that it would be immoral to leave it alone. However, surely the person that commits the act is not right to justify themselves? It's like how we don't let criminals to vote, why do you think that is? We don't let criminals vote because they lost that right when they committed the crime. However, this does not mean that their opinion and justification of the crime is any less worthy. Who are we to say what opinion is right and wrong? The fact that Alqueda would support 9/11 is a perfectly reasonable point. You seem to think that this nullifies the debate, but the debate is about whether terrorism can be justified or not, and if you agree then you are conceding that I am correct. To summarise my side of the arguments: 1) Terrorism can be justified when the thing being fought against is so terrible it would be worse to leave it to happen 2) Terrorism can always be justified by certain people as the justification is entirely subjective"	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

In a report to Texas elected officials, the state Department of Public Safety says border security agencies have arrested several Somali immigrants crossing the southern border who are known members of al-Shabab, the terrorist group that launched a deadly attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, and Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya, another Somalia-based group once funded by Osama bin Laden.

Border surveillance is k2 preventing terrorism Smarick et al. 12 (Kathleen Smarick and Gary D. LaFree of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. 11/12 ""Border Crossings and Terrorist Attacks in the United States: Lessons for Protecting against Dangerous Entrants"" START, http://www.start.umd.edu... CCC) An essential step in this project was determining the frequency and dynamics of border crossings by individuals who conducted or who wanted to conduct terrorism-related activities in the United States. Towards that goal, the project built upon the existing holdings of the American Terrorism Study (ATS) in this effort. The ATS, housed at the University of Arkansas, catalogs and systematically codes information on more than 300 Federal court cases involving Federal terrorist charges since 1980 and, following a review of other possible resources, proved to be the most useful starting point for compiling open-source, quantitative data on terrorist border crossings. Since 1989, the American Terrorism Study (ATS) has received lists of court cases and associated indictees that resulted from an official FBI terrorism investigation spanning 1980 through 2004. Housed at the University of Arkansas"" Terrorism Research Center in Fulbright College (TRC), the ATS now includes almost 400 cases from the FBI lists. Of these, approximately 75% of cases have complete court documentation, and almost all of those collected have been coded into the ATS database, while the ATS team continues to track new cases by collecting, reviewing, and coding new and additional court documentation. The ATS includes terrorism incidents and attacks, thwarted or planned terrorism incidents sometimes referred to as preventions, material support cases for terrorism, general terrorism conspiracies, and in some cases, immigration fraud; the common denominator among all ATS events is that the FBI investigated these events as terrorism-related incidents. During preliminary research for this project, court records from 378 terrorism cases found in the ATS dataset were reviewed for information on potential border crossing events related to terrorism cases. The documents for each court case were manually reviewed by researchers to determine whether the collected records reported that one of the defendants or accomplices in a case crossed a U.S. border at some point. Thirty-eight percent of the reviewed cases""145 cases""from 1980 through 2004 were found to either have: "" direct mention of a border crossing in the court documents, or "" a link to a terrorism incident that involved a known border crossing, either before or after an incident. After compiling this list of court cases for inclusion, each identified court case was then linked to a criminal incident involving terrorism charges. Initial reviews revealed a connection to a border-crossing event in a total of 58 successful terrorist attacks, 51 prevented or thwarted attacks, 26 material support cases, 33 immigration fraud incidents, and 4 general terrorism conspiracies. Additional reviews of relevant information on indictees and their activities resulted in a reduction in the number of successful terrorist attacks associated with these individuals to a total of 43. Appendix 2 provides more details on the data collection process and how a reliable collection methodology was established to create the U.S. Terrorist Border Crossing Dataset (USTBC), using the ATS as a starting point. National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism A Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Center of Excellence Border Crossings and Terrorist Attacks in the United States 12 Systematic evaluation by the research team revealed that the American Terrorism Study is a reliable and useful resource for identifying individuals associated with terrorist attacks or terrorist criminal cases (such as conspiracies) and for determining which of these individuals crossed U.S. borders in advance of or in the wake of their terrorism-related behavior. This is largely because the ATS is based on court documents, which among sources of data on terrorism are the most likely to reference relevant border crossing activity. The Global Terrorism Database, which is based primarily on media sources, can serve a supporting role in this research, but the ATS is the primary source allowing for construction of a new, relational database on U.S. Terrorist Border Crossings (USTBCs). That being said, it is important to recognize that the ATS is not a perfect data source. As noted above, its contents are limited to individuals and information related to court cases in which one or more defendant was charged with Federal terrorism charges. As such, the contents of ATS clearly represent a subset of all terrorists or attempted terrorists in the United States, as it systematically omits those who: "" were never arrested or faced any charges, "" were charged with offenses not directly related to terrorism, "" were charged at the non-Federal level, or "" were engaged in dangerous activity that does not meet the FBI""s definition of a terrorism case. Throughout this project, the research team was careful to respect the limitations of this data collection and to draw conclusions that recognize that the border crossing events included in this project likely represent a non-representative subset of all border crossing attempts by terrorists or intended terrorists. Despite these limitations, though, the data that was built upon the baseline of ATS provides important insights into the nexus between border crossings and terrorism. The U.S. Terrorism Border Crossing Dataset The final versions of the codebooks used to develop the U.S. Terrorist Border Crossing (USTBC) data collection are presented in Appendix 3. Based upon knowledge gained from pilot efforts (as discussed above and in Appendix 2), the project resulted in two codebooks""one focused on dynamics of a bordercrossing event involving someone associated with a Federal terrorism court case, and another focused on the characteristics of the individuals associated with Federal charges who were involved in the bordercrossing event. Data collection for the USTBC lasted for approximately one year and was primarily conducted by research assistants at the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas.3 The resultant data that comprise the USTBC are available in Appendix 4. Table 4 provides a snapshot summary of these data, which include detailed information on the location of an attempted crossing, the timing of a crossing relative to attempted or actual terrorist activity, the origin or destination of an attempted crossing, and more. The data also include specific information on border crossers, including their citizenship status, their criminal history, and key demographics (including level of education, marital status, etc.) Appendix 5 provides descriptive statistics from the border-crossing and border-crosser data. 3 Special thanks to Kim Murray and Summer Jackson of the Terrorism Research Center for their efforts in combing through the courtcase material and assembling these data for the USTBC. National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism A Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Center of Excellence Border Crossings and Terrorist Attacks in the United States 13 Border Crossings Identified in USTBC Attempts to Enter the United States Of the 221 border crossings identified in this project as involving individuals who were indicted by the U.S. government in terrorism-related cases, the majority (129 crossings) involved an individual attempting to enter the United States, while the remainder (92 crossings) involved an individual attempting to exit the United States. Eighty-seven percent of the attempted border crossings were successful, rather than being thwarted by law enforcement or foiled by some other events or developments. Additional discussion on the nature of successful crossings versus those who were apprehended at the border is presented below. Among those attempts to enter the United States, the most frequent origin for these crossing efforts was Canada.4 But, as Figure 2 illustrates, such attempted entries originated from all corners of the world. US Border Patrol proves that surveillance is key to anti-terror efforts Stamey 14 (Barcley; DOMESTIC AERIAL SURVEILLANCE AND HOMELAND SECURITY: SHOULD AMERICANS FEAR THE EYE IN THE SKY; March 2014) The leading national agency currently using drones to combat a wide range of domestic threats is U.S. Customs and Border Protection. With its fleet of seven MQ-1 Predators and three MQ-1 Guardians""Predators modified for marine surveillance""CBP 26 is at the forefront of large-scale drone operations. With an annual budget exceeding $11 billion, CBP is well equipped for protecting our national security while combating potential terrorist threats.55 But how efficiently are those funds being used, and what is meant by effectiveness? According to Merriam-Webster, effectiveness is ""producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect or result.""56 Ultimately, that desired result is safe international borders. Accomplishing this result involves the apprehension of illegal immigrants, interdiction of illicit drugs, and prevention of terrorist infiltration, which CBP does quite well, but with respect to UAS, effectiveness must be viewed on a much broader scale. This section takes into account the size of CBP, its operational budget, and couples it with published results. According to CBP, the primary mission of drone use is ""anti-terrorism by helping to identify and intercept potential terrorists and illegal cross-border activity.""57 CBP uses its Predators and Reapers to accomplish this goal through human detection and tracking, surface asset coordination, and threat detection through IR sensors in multiple scenarios. Previously mentioned sensor suites allow the Predator to detect movement along the border, identify actual personnel numbers, and track the location of threats all while being unobserved to the individuals on the ground. With their long loiter times, Predators allow officials to monitor gaps along the border while maximizing the efforts of ground personnel in actual interdiction missions. After witnessing the functionality of actual Predator operations in Afghanistan, this author realizes the value in having high definition video sensors overhead during dangerous operations. This type of technology certainly has a place in homeland security missions, and future capabilities will provide a clear advantage to U.S. personnel in combating border security. This force multiplier mindset is one CBP has adopted and publicizes regularly to justify the success of its drone program. Long loiter times, remote area access, and flexibility during National Special Security Events are common claims.

Esseghaier and Jaser have been charged in Canada with conspiracy to commit murder for the benefit of a terrorist group, participating in a terrorist group, and conspiring to interfere with transportation facilities for the benefit of a terrorist group. Esseghaier has also been charged with participating in a terrorist group, and both men face up to life in prison.[206] The two men are awaiting trial. Chiheb Esseghaier wants to represent himself, basing his defense on the Quran instead of on the Canadian criminal code, which has caused delays in the proceedings.[207] Continued use of border surveillance technology is crucial to the detection of and response to threats on the border Haddal 10, Specialist in Immigration Policy, 8/11/10 (Chad C. Haddal, Congressional Research Service report, August 11, 2010, ""Border Security: The Role of the U.S. Border Patrol"" https://www.fas.org..., accessed 7/15/15 JH @ DDI) Perhaps the most important technology used by the Border Patrol are the surveillance assets currently in place at the border. The program has gone through several iterations and name changes. Originally known as the Integrated Surveillance Information System (ISIS), the program""s name was changed to the America""s Shield Initiative (ASI) in FY2005. DHS subsequently folded ASI into the Secure Border Initative (SBI) and renamed the program SBInet Technology (SBInet). Once it is beyond the pilot phase, SBInet will, according to DHS, develop and install ""new integrated technology solutions to provide enhanced detection, tracking, response, and situational awareness capabilities.""19 The other program under SBI is the SBI Tactical Infrastructure program, which, according to DHS, ""develops and installs physical components designed to consistently slow, delay, and be an obstacle to illegal cross-border activity.""20 In the late 1990s, the Border Patrol began deploying a network of Remote Video Surveillance (RVS) systems (i.e., camera systems), underground sensors, and the Integrated Computer Assisted Detection (ICAD) database into a multi-faceted network designed to detect illegal entries in a wide range of climate conditions. This Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS) attempted to ensure seamless coverage of the border by combining the feeds from multiple color, thermal, and infrared cameras mounted on different structures into one remote-controlled system with information generated by sensors (including seismic, magnetic, and thermal detectors). When a sensor is tripped, an alarm is sent to a central communications control room at a USBP station or sector headquarters. USBP personnel monitoring the control room screens use the ICAD system to re-position RVS cameras towards the location where the sensor alarm was tripped (although some camera positions are fixed and cannot be panned). Control room personnel then alert field agents to the intrusion and coordinate the response. Information gathered from surveillance activities is key to any effective response to terrorist threats along the border Fisher 12, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Border Patrol Chief, 5/8/12 (Michael, Department of Homeland Security, ""Written testimony of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher for a House Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security hearing titled ""Measuring Border Security: U.S. Border Patrol""s New Strategic Plan and the Path Forward."""" http://www.dhs.gov...; accessed 7/15/15 JH@ DDI) Information gathered from reconnaissance, community engagement, sign-cutting and technology together provide situational awareness and intelligence and helps us to best understand and assess the threats we face along our borders. Information and intelligence will empower Border Patrol leadership and front line agents to get ahead of the threat, be predictive and proactive. Integration denotes CBP corporate planning and execution of border security operations, while leveraging partnerships with other federal, state, local, tribal, and international organizations. Integration of effort with these organizations will ensure we bring all available capabilities and tools to bear in addressing threats. Lastly, through rapid response, we will deploy capabilities efficiently and effectively to meet and mitigate the risks we confront. Put simply, rapid response means the Border Patrol and its partners can quickly and appropriately respond to changing threats. Goal 1: Secure America""s Borders The 2012 Strategic Plan has two interrelated and interdependent goals. In the first goal, the Border Patrol will work with its federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners to secure America""s borders using information, integration and rapid response in a risk-based manner. There are five objectives within this goal: Prevent Terrorists and Terrorist Weapons from Entering the United States Manage Risk Disrupt and Degrade Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) Whole-of-Government Approach Increase Community Engagement I. Prevent Terrorists and Terrorist Weapons from Entering the United States The current risk environment is characterized by constantly evolving threats that are both complex and varying, and the Border Patrol must strategically apply intelligence to ensure that operations are focused and targeted against the greatest threats. The Border Patrol""s ability to prevent and disrupt such threats is enhanced through increased information sharing and operational integration, planning, and execution with our domestic and foreign law enforcement partners. Integration with our federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners"" intelligence and enforcement capabilities into the planning and execution of CBP operations is critical to our ability to secure our nation""s borders. The use of necessary surveillance technology is key to the identification and prevention of terrorist threats on the border Office of Border Patrol 4, September 2004 (THE OFFICE OF BORDER PATROL AND THE OFFICE OF POLICY AND PLANNING, US CUSTOMS & BORDER PROTECTION, ""National Border Patrol Strategy"" http://www.au.af.mil..., accessed 7/15/15 JH @ DDI) The Border Patrol currently uses a mix of agents, information, and technology to control the border. The Border Patrol""s ability to establish situational awareness, monitor, detect, respond to, and identify potential terrorists, instruments of terrorism, and criminals relies heavily on interdiction and deterrence-based technology. Having the necessary technology to support the Border Patrol priority and traditional missions cannot be overstated. In the future, there must be continued assessment, development, and deployment of the appropriate mix of personnel, technology, and information to gain, maintain, and expand coverage of the border and ensure that resources are deployed in a cost-effective, efficient fashion. Technology which enhances operational awareness and effectiveness includes camera systems for day/ night/infrared work, biometric systems such as IDENT/IAFIS, processing systems like ENFORCE, sensoring platforms, large-scale gamma X-rays, and aerial platforms, and other systems. Technologies requiring modernization include wireless and tactical communications and computer processing capabilities. Coordination between Border Patrol and inspectional personnel at the ports of entry ensures the most efficient use of trained personnel and technology. In the future, the Border Patrol will take advantage of the targeting and selectivity tools made available in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) and the National Targeting Center. The continued testing, evaluation, acquisition, and deployment of appropriate border enforcement technologies will be pursued vigorously so that the maximum force-multiplier effect is achieved in support of both the priority and traditional missions.

""And it would be naive to rule out the possibility that any criminal organizations around the world, including terrorists, would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our country""s international border."" Maximized surveillance on the border is key to stopping terrorism Willis et al 10 [Henry H. Willis, 2010, director of the RAND Homeland Security and Defense Center, with Joel B. Predd, Paul K. Davis and Wayne P. Brown, RAND.org, ""Measuring the Effectiveness of Border Security Between Ports-of-Entry"", http://www.rand.org..., jf] One of the unexpected results of our study was recognition of the importance of networked intelligence in elaborating objectives for and measuring effectiveness of border security.11 This came about for many reasons. First, all of the focus missions are best understood in national terms: Border security contributes significantly to several high-level national objectives, but results depend sensitively on interactions with and the performance of other federal and local agencies, as well as economic and demographic conditions outside of DHS""s control. Second, national-level effectiveness depends not just on individual component or agency effectiveness but also on components"" ability to share information and work collaboratively, i.e., to network. This is perhaps most obvious with respect to preventing terrorism, in that individuals might enter the country who are vaguely suspicious but who cannot reasonably be arrested at the border. Responsibility for follow-up then transfers to, e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). However, the FBI""s ability to follow up""either immediately or when further information emerges""might depend critically on information collected and effectively transferred by border agencies to the FBI. The word ""effectively"" is key because all agencies are deluged with data. The 9/11 Commission""s report dramatized the consequences of ineffectiveness: It is not that information for apprehending the perpetrators did not exist, but rather that the dots were not connected and the relevant agencies did not cooperate well (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004). Third, national-level law enforcement also depends on the effectiveness of the justice system, including the ability to convict and punish. That, in turn, often depends on authorities being able to construct an extensive, fact-based story of criminal behavior from which, cumulatively, guilt can reasonably be inferred by a jury. Fourth, the nature and quality of information collected by border-security components, the consistency with which it is collected, and the effectiveness with which the data are both transferred to national databases and""where appropriate""highlighted in cross-agency actions, are leverage points for improved national-level effectiveness, especially in relation to terrorism- or drug-related functions. Border-security eff orts sometimes will query detected travelers against data sets of known or suspected terrorists or criminals. This is especially relevant at ports of entry, ports of egress in some modes, and in cases in which border enforcement detains an illegal crosser. In other settings, border-enforcement agencies collect as much information as possible on individuals, their conveyances, license plates, accounts, and other records of persons detained for crossing illegally but for whom no prior records exist. The same is true in the maritime regions when individuals are arrested for illegal drug smuggling or illegal migrant smuggling. The collected information can become future tactical intelligence (and used in prosecutions) if the detained person becomes involved in criminal or terrorist functions at a later date. Discussions with component agencies indicate that this is an important capability to measure. Technologically, it is even possible to tag individuals so that subsequent surveillance within the United States (or another country) is possible.12 Border surveillance prevents terrorist groups from attempting attacks Willis et al 10 [Henry H. Willis, 2010, director of the RAND Homeland Security and Defense Center, with Joel B. Predd, Paul K. Davis and Wayne P. Brown, RAND.org, ""Measuring the Effectiveness of Border Security Between Ports-of-Entry"", http://www.rand.org..., pg 19, jf] The principal contributions that border security makes to counterterrorism relate to preventing certain kinds of terrorist attacks dependent on flows into the country of people or materials. These contributions can be illustrated by considering what opportunities exist to disrupt terrorist attacks while they are being planned and orchestrated. Through a number of planning efforts, DHS and its components have developed detailed planning scenarios of terrorist events (DHS, 2006). Each of these scenarios has been deconstructed into attack trees that are useful for considering how DHS border-security programs contribute to terrorism security efforts. In their most generic form, these attack trees specify dimensions of attack scenarios with respect to building the terrorist team, identifying a target, and acquiring a weapon (see Figure 4.1). This decomposition of attack planning provides a structure around which to consider how interdiction, deterrence, and networked intelligence contribute to preventing terrorist attacks and, thus, why it is relevant to measure these functions. DHS border-security eff orts focus on interdiction of terrorist team members and weapons or weapon components when they cross U.S. borders. Examples of initiatives that are intended to enhance these capabilities include the Secure Border Initiative, the acquisition of Advanced Spectroscopic Portals for nuclear detection, the Secure Communities Initiative, and US-VISIT. In addition, it is often pointed out that, when border-security measures are perceived to be effective, terrorists groups may be deterred from attacking in particular ways, or possibly from attacking at all. This could result from awareness of what type of surveillance is occurring or the capability of interdiction systems. In either case, deterrence refers to the judgment of terrorists that they will not be successful, leading them to choose another course of action. Finally, many border-security initiatives also contribute information to the national networked-intelligence picture. For example, the Secure Communities Initiative has implemented new capabilities to allow a single submission of fingerprints as part of the normal criminal arrest and booking process to be queried against both the FBI and DHS immigration and terrorism databases. This effort makes it easier for federal and local law enforcement to share actionable intelligence and makes it more difficult for terrorists to evade border-security efforts. Drones Drones are critical to combat bio- and chemical-terror Koerner 2015 (Matthew R, Duke University School of Law, J.D. expected 2015, ""DRONES AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT: REDEFINING EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY"", 64 Duke L.J. 1129) Senator Dianne Feinstein, a staunch advocate of governmental surveillance n1 and Chairman of the 113th Congress's Senate Intelligence Committee, n2 recently found herself, rather ironically, as the target of surveillance. n3 One day at her home, Senator Feinstein walked to the window to check on a protest that was taking place outside. n4 Much to her surprise, a small drone n5 hovered on the other side of the window, only inches away, spying on her. n6 The drone immediately flew away. n7 Senator Feinstein's experience is just one example of drones being used for surveillance within the United States. But her story and others like it n8 have sparked significant controversy over the use of drones for domestic surveillance, which falls within a broader debate [*1131] on privacy and governmental surveillance programs. n9 Advocates of robust federal surveillance policies champion governmental surveillance as the only way to prevent terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States. n10 President Barack Obama defended these surveillance programs as """"modest encroachments on privacy'"" that ""strike the ""right balance' between national security and civil liberties."" n11 In comparison, privacy advocates envision these surveillance programs leading to a dystopian, totalitarian government watching over its citizenry - undetected but omnipresent. n12 References to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four n13 abound. n14 [*1132] Apart from the surrounding privacy-concerns debate, drones currently provide many practical benefits and their projected applications seem limitless. n15 Based on their obvious advantage of being unmanned, drones have the capability to conduct missions previously considered too risky, dangerous, or impracticable. These applications are also provided at continuously decreasing costs and with the latest technological sophistication, such as the capability to see through physical obstructions, to detect various chemical and biological agents in the air, to recognize human faces and license plates, and to fly in strategic, coordinated formations. n16 Drones provide effective surveillance of the borders Spagat 2014 (Elliot, ""Drones replacing officers in Mexican border surveillance"", Nov 13; www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20141113/drones-replacing-officers-in-mexican-border-surveillance) The U.S. government now patrols nearly half the Mexican border by drones alone in a largely unheralded shift to control desolate stretches where there are no agents, camera towers, ground sensors or fences, and it plans to expand the strategy to the Canadian border. It represents a significant departure from a decades-old approach that emphasizes boots on the ground and fences. Since 2000, the number of Border Patrol agents on the 1,954-mile border more than doubled "" to surpass 18,000 "" and fencing multiplied nine times to 700 miles. Under the new approach, Predator B aerial drones, used in the fight against insurgents in Afghanistan, sweep remote mountains, canyons and rivers with a high-resolution video camera and return within three days for another video in the same spot, two officials with direct knowledge of the effort said on condition of anonymity because details have not been made public. The two videos are then overlaid for analysts, who use sophisticated software to identify tiny changes "" perhaps the tracks of a farmer or cows, perhaps those of immigrants who entered the country illegally or perhaps a drug-laden Hummer, they said. About 92 percent of drone missions have shown no change in terrain, while the others raised enough questions to dispatch agents to determine if someone got away, sometimes by helicopter because the area is so remote. The agents look for any sign of human activity "" footprints, broken twigs, trash. About 4 percent of missions have been false alarms, like tracks of livestock or farmers, and about 2 percent are inconclusive. The remaining 2 percent offer evidence of illegal crossings from Mexico, which typically results in ground sensors being planted for closer monitoring. The government has operated about 10,000 drone flights under the strategy, known internally as ""change detection,"" since it began in March 2013. The flights currently cover about 900 miles, much of it in Texas, and are expected to expand to the Canadian border by the end of 2015. The purpose is to assign agents where illegal activity is highest, said R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol""s parent agency, which operates nine unmanned aircraft across the country. ""You have finite resources,"" he said in an interview. ""If you can look at some very rugged terrain (and) you can see there""s not traffic, whether it""s tire tracks or clothing being abandoned or anything else, you want to deploy your resources to where you have a greater risk, a greater threat."" If the video shows the terrain unchanged, Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher calls it ""proving the negative"" "" showing there isn""t anything illegal happening there and therefore no need for agents and fences. The strategy was launched without fanfare and is being expanded as President Barack Obama prepares to issue an executive order by the end of this year to reduce deportations and enhance border security. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, applauded the approach while noting surveillance gaps still remain. ""We can no longer focus only on static defenses such as fences and fixed (camera) towers,"" he said. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who coauthored legislation last year to add 20,000 Border Patrol agents and 350 miles of fencing to the southwest border, said, ""If there are better ways of ensuring the border is secure, I am certainly open to considering those options."" Border missions fly out of Sierra Vista, home of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, or Corpus Christi, Texas. They patrol at altitudes between 19,000 at 28,000 feet and from between 25 and 60 miles of the border. The first step is for Border Patrol sector chiefs to identify areas least likely to attract smugglers, typically those far from towns and roads. Analysts scour the drone videos at operations centers in Riverside; Grand Forks, North Dakota; and Sierra Vista. After an initial survey, the drones return within a week for another sweep. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about drones since Customs and Border Protection introduced them in 2006, saying there is potential to monitor innocent people under no suspicion. Lothar Eckardt, the agency""s executive director of national air security operations, said law-abiding people shouldn""t worry and that cameras are unable to capture details like license plate numbers and faces on the ground. He looked on one September morning as a drone taxied down a runway in Sierra Vista, lifted off with a muffled buzz and disappeared over a rocky mountain range into a blue Arizona sky. About a dozen computer screens line the wall of their trailer, showing the weather, maps and real-time images of the ground below. Eckardt said there is ""no silver bullet"" for addressing border security but that using drones in highly remote areas is part of the overall effort. If there""s nothing there, he said, ""let""s not waste the manpower here. Let""s focus our efforts someplace else, where they""re needed."" Drones are necessary to protect the border Ingram 2013 (David, How drones are used for domestic surveillance, Jun 19, www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0619/How-drones-are-used-for-domestic-surveillance) The U.S. government has made no secret of its use of drones to monitor the United States border with Mexico. The Obama administration has been defending its surveillance tactics since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden released secret documents revealing a massive database of daily telephone records, as well as coordination between the NSA and social media companies. The programs are designed to target militants outside the United States who are suspected of planning attacks, but they inevitably gather some data on Americans, U.S. officials said. In a May speech, Obama defended the use of armed drones abroad but said the United States should never deploy armed drones over U.S. soil. The Justice Department had disclosed that two domestic law enforcement agencies use unmanned aircraft systems, according to a department statement sent to the Judiciary Committee and released on Wednesday by Grassley's office. The two are the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Grassley sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday asking why the Justice Department did not earlier mention the FBI's use of drones. At Wednesday's hearing, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said she was concerned about the privacy implications of drone surveillance. ""The greatest threat to the privacy of Americans is the drone and the use of the drone, and the very few regulations that are on it today,"" Feinstein said. Mueller reiterated that drone use is rare. ""It is very narrowly focused on particularized cases and particularized needs,"" he said. Mueller is due to retire when his term expires in September. Border drones effectively and efficiently monitor the border RussiaTimes ""14 (November 13, 2014, http://rt.com..., 7-3-15) Predator drones are silently patrolling almost half of the United States"" border with Mexico, looking for illegal immigrants, human traffickers and drug cartels in desolated areas the government agents can""t realistically patrol. The unmanned aircraft fly over about 900 miles of rural areas where there are no US Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) agents, camera towers, ground sensors or fences along the 1,954-mile border, according to a new report by the Associated Press. The Predator Bs use a high-resolution video camera and then return within three days for another video in the same spot, two officials told the wire service. The two videos are then overlaid for analysts who use sophisticated software to identify tiny changes. There are changes in terrain in only eight percent of the drone missions under the current strategy R10; known internally as ""change detection"" R10; since it began in March 2013. Of those flagged missions, about four percent were false alarms, like tracks from livestock or farmers, and about two percent are inconclusive to the agents dispatched to the area to investigate. The remaining 2 percent offer evidence R10; like footprints, broken twigs, trash R10; of illegal crossings from Mexico, which typically results in ground sensors being planted for closer monitoring. In the last year and a half, CPB has operated about 10,000 drone flights, with much of their missions over Texas. Border missions fly out of Sierra Vista, home of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, or Corpus Christi, Texas. They patrol at altitudes between 19,000 at 28,000 feet and between 25 and 60 miles of the border. The program is expected to expand the the Canadian border by the end of 2015. The purpose is to assign agents where illegal activity is highest, R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, which operates nine unmanned aircraft across the country, told AP. ""You have finite resources,"" he said in an interview. ""If you can look at some very rugged terrain (and) you can see there's not traffic, whether it's tire tracks or clothing being abandoned or anything else, you want to deploy your resources to where you have a greater risk, a greater threat."" Gregory McNeal, a law professor and drone expert at Pepperdine University, told NBC News in July that the money spent on drones is worth it. ""This is a better way to patrol the border than helicopters,"" he said. ""It""s not a comprehensive immigration solution or border security solution, but more surveillance time in the air will help plug gaps in the border."" A typical Predator drone can fly for 12 hours before landing, compared to three for a standard helicopter. But the cost is much higher: Predator drones require a crew of between five to eight people R10; plus maintenance staff R10; to operate, coming out to about $3,000 an hour to fly. And each one has an $18 million price tag, NBC News reported. CPB began rolling out Predators in 2005, but rapidly expanded the unmanned aerial reconnaissance operation along the US-Mexico border at the beginning of this decade, the Washington Post reported in 2011. Michael Kostelnik, a retired Air Force general and former test pilot who is the assistant commissioner of CPB""s Office of Air and Marine, told the Post then that he had yet to be challenged in Congress about the appropriate use of domestic drones. ""Instead, the question is: Why can""t we have more of them in my district?"" Kostelnik said. In July, President Barack Obama requested $39.4 million for aerial surveillance, including troops, along the US-Mexican border. The emergency funding was for 16,526 additional drone and manned aircraft flight hours for border surveillance, and 16 additional drone crews to better detect and stop illegal activity, according to administration officials. The request was in response to the humanitarian crisis after tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and families illegally entered the country in the first half of the year. ""Border Patrol wants the money and it wants the drones,"" McNeal said. ""This is the kind of crisis where, if you are Border Patrol, you seize the opportunity to get more funding from Congress."" The agency""s ""unmanned and manned aircraft can continue to support ongoing border security operations, specifically regarding the tracking of illegal cross-border smuggling operations,"" a CBP official told Nextgov. The president""s request was part of a larger funding appeal of $3.7 billion to deal with the illegal immigrants and border security problems. In January, CPB was forced to ground its entire fleet of drones after a mechanical function forced a crew to crash an unmanned aircraft valued at $12 million. The mishap lowered the number of agency drones to only nine. Domestic drones k2 solve for terrorism Bauer 13 (Max Bauer, of ACLU of Massachusetts 9-11-2013, ""Domestic Drone Surveillance Usage: Threats and Opportunities for Regulation,"" https://privacysos.org... CCC) Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, are an emerging and rapidly-expanding development in domestic surveillance technology. [4] On Valentine""s Day 2012, President Barack Obama signed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, legislation authorizing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop regulations to facilitate the growing usage of drones in domestic airspace. [5] Drones are best known for their use in military operations [6] including the use of weaponized drones for targeted killing. But drones have been used for domestic surveillance purposes for years [7] and their usage is expected to grow exponentially. [8] The FAA has issued 1,428 drone operator permits since 2007 (as of mid-February) and predicts there will be 10,000 drones deployed within the next five years. [9] A public information request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation showed that numerous universities and law enforcement agencies have been approved to use drones by the FAA. [10] Of course, the widespread use of drones for domestic surveillance raises serious privacy concerns. [11] Drones can be outfitted with high definition [12] and infrared cameras, [13] and even license plate readers. [14] Drones ""present unique threats to privacy,"" in the words of one privacy advocate. [15] Why? They are smaller "" potentially insect-sized, [16] can fly longer "" perhaps soon in perpetuity, [17] and are not bound by the historical, practical check on law enforcement excesses we've had as a result of limited police resources. [18] In a seminal 1890 law review article aptly-titled The Right to Privacy, future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis recognized that ""instantaneous photographs"" have invaded the secret precincts of private and domestic life""Of the desirability "" indeed of the necessity "" of some such protection there can, it is believed, be no doubt."" [19] Brandeis and his co-author Samuel Warren were ahead of their time when they wrote that article but even they couldn""t foresee anything like the domestic surveillance schemes that have arisen over a century later. Drones Used in Massachusetts and Response to Boston Marathon Bombings. Late in 2012, the Boston Globe reported that a SWAT team in Massachusetts had filed an application with the FAA for a drone. [20] As of April 2013, there were no police drones yet in Massachusetts but Waltham-based defense contractor Raytheon was flying many of them in testing capacities. [21] Surveillance and war contracting companies hope to expand their market from military to domestic law enforcement. [22] Following the explosion of two bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon, parts of the city shut down as the search for a suspect continued, prompting Ron Paul to write: ""This unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself."" [23] Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told the public shortly afterward that he seeks more surveillance cameras (there are already hundreds) in downtown Boston. [24] And further, he said, he wants to have drone surveillance for next year""s marathon. [25] Drones K2 stop terrorism Byman, 13 (Daniel L. Byman, Director of research at Center for Middle East Policy, 8/2013, http://www.brookings.edu... CCC) The Obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation, since Obama has been in the White House, U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban""top figures who are not easily replaced. In 2010, Osama bin Laden warned his chief aide, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was later killed by a drone strike in the Waziristan region of Pakistan in 2011, that when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is ""the rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders"" and who are prone to errors and miscalculations. And drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers. Drones have also undercut terrorists"" ability to communicate and to train new recruits. In order to avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda and Taliban operatives try to avoid using electronic devices or gathering in large numbers. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to ""maintain complete silence of all wireless contacts"" and ""avoid gathering in open areas."" Leaders, however, cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda""s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders Drones take out terrorist leaders Al-Haj, 15 (Ahmed Al-Haj, writer for the Stars & Stripes and AP the big story, 7/10/2015, http://www.stripes.com... CCC) Yemeni security and military officials say a suspected U.S. drone strike killed four al-Qaida members travelling by car in the coastal city of Mukalla. The officials say the airstrike took place on Friday night in Mukalla, the capital of Yemen's sprawling eastern Hadramawt province. The explosion was heard in some parts of the city. Al-Qaida's Yemen branch, considered to be the most dangerous offshoot of the terror network, has made gains in the province and captured Mukalla earlier this year. The officials say at least five other militants were wounded in the airstrike. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to reporters. Al-Qaida has profited from the turmoil that has engulfed Yemen, and U.S. drones have continued to target top al-Qaida leaders there. AT Retaliation AT: Retaliation Ayson flips neg- terrorism is not an existential risk Ayson 10 (Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington, ""After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,"" Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, 33.7, Francis & Taylor) A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the @257;rst place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in signi@257;cant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-@257;rst century might bring would fade into insigni@257;cance alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state possessors themselves. No US nuclear retaliation Neely 13 (Meggaen Neely, The George Washington University Master of Arts (M.A.), Security Policy Studies 2012""2014 (expected) Baylor University Master of Arts (M.A.), Public Policy and Administration 2010""2012, Richard D.

Because of the difficulty of deterring transnational actors, many deterrence advocates shift the focus to deterring state sponsors of nuclear terrorism. The argument applies whether or not the state intended to assist nuclear terrorists. If terrorists obtain a nuclear weapon or fissile materials from a state, the theory goes, then the United States will track the weapon""s country of origin using nuclear forensics, and retaliate against that country. If this is U.S. policy, advocates predict that states will be deterred from assisting terrorists with their nuclear ambitions. Yet, let""s think about the series of events that would play out if a terrorist organization detonated a weapon in the United States. Let""s assume forensics confirmed the weapon""s origin, and let""s assume, for argument""s sake, that country was Pakistan. Would the United States then retaliate with a nuclear strike? If a nuclear attack occurs within the next four years (a reasonable length of time for such predictions concerning current international and domestic politics), it seems unlikely. Why? First, there""s the problem of time. Though nuclear forensics is useful, it takes time to analyze the data and determine the country of origin. Any justified response upon a state sponsor would not be swift. Second, even if the United States proved the country of origin, it would then be difficult to determine that Pakistan willingly and intentionally sponsored nuclear terrorism. If Pakistan did, then nuclear retaliation might be justified. However, if Pakistan did not, nuclear retaliation over unsecured nuclear materials would be a disproportionate response and potentially further detrimental. Should the United States launch a nuclear strike at Pakistan, Islamabad could see this as an initial hostility by the United States, and respond adversely. An obvious choice, given current tensions in South Asia, is for Pakistan to retaliate against a U.S. nuclear launch on its territory by initiating conflict with India, which could turn nuclear and increase the exchanges of nuclear weapons. Hence, it seems more likely that, after the international outrage at a terrorist group""s nuclear detonation, the United States would attempt to stop the bleeding without a nuclear strike. Instead, some choices might include deploying forces to track down those that supported the suicide terrorists that detonated the weapon, pressuring Pakistan to exert its sovereignty over fringe regions such as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and increasing the number of drone strikes in Waziristan. Given the initial attack, such measures might understandably seem more of a concession than the retaliation called for by deterrence models, even more so by the American public. This is not an argument against those technologies associated with nuclear forensics. The United States and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should continue their development and distribution. Instead, I question the presumed American response that is promulgated by deterrence advocates. By looking at possibilities for a U.S. response to nuclear terrorism, a situation in which we assume that deterrence has failed, we cast doubt on the likelihood of a U.S. retaliatory nuclear strike and hence cast doubt on the credibility of a U.S. retaliatory nuclear strike as a deterrent. Would the United States launch a nuclear weapon now unless it was sure of another state""s intentional sponsorship of nuclear terrorism? Any reasonable doubt of sponsorship might stay the United States"" nuclear hand. Given the opaqueness of countries"" intentions, reasonable doubt over sponsorship is inevitable to some degree. Other countries are probably aware of U.S. hesitance in response to terrorists"" use of nuclear weapons. If this thought experiment is true, then the communication required for credible retaliatory strikes under deterrence of nuclear terrorism is missing. The threat of a nuclear retaliation is exaggerated "" even stolen material can be easily traced Lieber and Press 13 (*Keir A. Lieber and **Daryl G. Press, *Received his M.A. and Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago, Associate Professor in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Department of Government, **Associate Professor in the Department of Government, Dartmouth College. He received a Ph.D. in Political Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ""Why States Won""t Give Nuclear Weapons to Terrorists"", Summer 2013, International Security, Vol. 38, No. 1, Pages 80-104) This gloomy picture overstates the difficulty of determining the source of stolen material after a nuclear terrorist attack. In the wake of a detonation, the possibility of stolen fissile material complicates the task of attribution""but only marginally. At the end of the Cold War, several countries""particularly in the former Soviet Union""confronted major nuclear security problems, but great progress has been made since then.40 Although no country has perfect nuclear security, today the greatest concerns surround just five countries: Belarus, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, and South Africa.41 In addition, not all of those states are equally worrisome as potential sources of nuclear theft. Substantial concerns exist about the security of fissile materials in Pakistan and Russia (the latter if simply because of the large size of its stockpile), but Belarus, Japan, and South Africa would likely be quickly and easily ruled out as the source of stolen fissile material. Belarus has a relatively small stockpile of fissile material""approximately 100 kilograms of HEU42""so in the wake of a nuclear terrorist attack, it would be easy for Belarus to show that its stockpile remained intact.43 Similarly, Japan (one of the United States"" closest allies) and South Africa would be keen to allow the United States to verify the integrity of their full stocks of materials. (In the wake of a nuclear terror attack, a lack of full cooperation in showing all materials accounted for would be highly revealing.) Iran is not believed to have any weapons-usable nuclear material to steal,44 although that could change. In short, a nuclear handoff strategy disguised as a loose nukes problem would be very precarious.45 No retaliation "" international cooperation and limited suspects solve Lieber and Press 13 (*Keir A. Lieber and **Daryl G. Press, *Received his M.A. and Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago, Associate Professor in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Department of Government, **Associate Professor in the Department of Government, Dartmouth College. He received a Ph.D. in Political Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ""Why States Won""t Give Nuclear Weapons to Terrorists"", Summer 2013, International Security, Vol. 38, No. 1, Pages 80-104) There are at least five reasons, however, to expect that attributing a nuclear terrorist attack would be easier than attributing a conventional terrorist attack. First, no terrorism investigation in history has had the resources that would be deployed to investigating the source of a nuclear terror attack""particularly one against the United States or a U.S. ally. Rapidly attributing the attack would be critical, not merely as a first step toward satisfying the rage of the victims but, more importantly, to determine whether additional nuclear attacks were imminent. The victim would use every resource at its disposal"" money, threats, and force""to rapidly identify the source of the attack.47 If necessary, any investigation would go on for a long time; it would never ""blow over"" from the victim""s standpoint. The second reason why attributing a nuclear terror attack would be easier than attributing a conventional terrorist attack is the level of international assistance the victim would likely receive from allies, neutrals, and even adversaries. An attack on the United States, for example, would likely trigger unprecedented intelligence cooperation from its allies, if for no other reason than the fear that subsequent attacks might target them. Perhaps more important, even adversaries of the United States""particularly those with access to fissile materials""would have enormous incentives to quickly demonstrate their innocence. To avoid being accused of sponsoring or supporting the attack, and thus to avoid the wrath of the United States, these countries would likely go to great lengths to demonstrate that their weapons were accounted for, that their fissile materials had different isotopic properties than the type used in the attack, and that they were sharing any information they had on the attack. The cooperation that the United States received from Iran and Pakistan in the wake of the September 11 attacks illustrates how potential adversaries may be motivated to help in the aftermath of an attack and stay off the target list for retaliation.48 The pressure to cooperate after an anonymous nuclear detonation on U.S. soil would be many times greater.49 Third, the strong positive relationship between the number of fatalities stemming from an attack and the rate of attribution (as depicted in figures 1 to 3 above) suggests that the probability of attribution after a nuclear attack"" with its enormous casualties""should be even higher. The 97 percent attribution rate for attacks that killed ten or more people on U.S. soil or that of its allies is based on a set of attacks that were pinpricks compared to nuclear terrorism. The data in those figures suggest that our conclusions understate the actual likelihood of nuclear attribution. Fourth, the challenge of attribution after a terrorist nuclear attack should be easier than after a conventional terrorist attack, because the investigation would begin with a highly restricted suspect list. In the case of a conventional terror attack against the United States or an ally, one might begin the investigation at the broadest level with the U.S. Department of State""s list of fifty-one foreign terrorist organizations. In the case of a nuclear terror attack, only fifteen of these FTOs have state sponsors""and only one sponsor (Pakistan) has either nuclear weapons or fissile materials. (If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, that number will grow to two, but there is no overlap between the terror groups that Pakistan supports and those that Iran assists.) Finally, any operation to detonate a nuclear weapon would involve complex planning and coordination""securing the weapon, learning to use it, planning the time and location of detonation, moving the weapon to the target, and conducting the attack. Even if only a small cadre of operatives knew the nuclear nature of the attack, the planning of a spectacular operation would be hard to keep secret.50 For example, six months prior to the September 11 attacks, Western intelligence detected numerous indications that al-Qaida was planning a major attack. The intelligence was not speci fic enough""or the agencies were not nimble enough""to prevent the operation, but the indicators were ""blinking red"" for months, directing U.S. attention to al-Qaida as soon as the attacks began.51 Turns Case Terrorism is used as a justification for increased surveillance "" empirics prove and turns case Haggerty and Gazso 2005 (Kevin, Professor of Criminology and Sociology at the University of Alberta; Amber, Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at York University, The Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie, Vol. 30, No. 2 ( Spring, 2005), pp. 169-187 ""Seeing beyond the Ruins: Surveillance as a Response to Terrorist Threats"" JSTOR; accessed 7/17/15 JH @ DDI) A climate of fear and anxiety helped ease the passage of such laws (Davis, 2001). However, a great deal of organizational opportunism was also at work. Many of the surveillance proposals adopted in the days after the attack were recycled from earlier legislative efforts. In previous incarnations these proposals had often been legitimated as essential for the international ""war on drugs"" or to address other crimes, such as money laundering. The September 11 th attacks gave the authorities a new and apparently unassailable legitimation for long-standing legislative ambitions. Before the dust had settled on Manhattan, the security establishment had mobilized to expand and intensify their surveillance capabilities, justifying existing proposals as necessary tools to fight the new war against terrorism. Ultimately, the police, military and security establishment reaped an unanticipated windfall of increased funding, new technology and loosened legislative constraints by strategically invoking fears of future attacks. There are several examples of such opportunism. Since at least 1999, when Congress initially turned down their request, the U.S. Justice Department has lobbied for the development of new ""secret search"" provisions. Likewise, prior to the attacks, the FBI and the National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee had a lengthy shopping list of desired surveillance-related measures including legal enhancements to their wiretapping capabilities, legal constraints on the public use of cryptography, and provisions for governmental agents to compel Internet service providers to provide information on their customers (Burnham, 1997). All of these proposals were recycled and implemented after the September 11th attacks now justified as integral tools in the ""war on terrorism."" New provisions requiring banks to exercise ""due diligence"" in relation to their large depositors were originally justified by the authorities as a means to counter the ""war on drugs."" The opportunism of many of these efforts was inadvertently revealed by an RCMP Sergeant when, during a discussion about new official antiterrorism powers to monitor financial transactions, he noted that: ""We've been asking for something like this for four years. It's really our best weapon against biker gangs"" [emphasis added] (Corcan, 2001). In Canada, the Federal Privacy Commissioner was particularly alarmed by the development of what he referred to as a ""Big Brother database."" This amounts to a detailed computerized record of information about Canadian travelers. Although justified as a means to counter terrorism, the data will be made available to other government departments for any purpose they deem appropriate. Such provisions raise the specter of informational ""fishing expeditions."" Indeed, the Canadian government has already indicated that this ostensible anti-terrorist database will be used to help monitor tax evaders and catch domestic criminals. It will also be used to scrutinize an individual's travel history and destinations, in an effort to try and determine whether they might be a pedophile or money launderer (Radwanski, 2002). While these are laudable goals, they also reveal how a host of other surveillance agendas have been furthered by capitalizing on the new anti-terrorism discourse. Lone wolf terror attacks are used to justify disproportionate increases in surveillance and military operations abroad Lennard, Senior News Analyst for Vice News, 10/27/14 (Natasha Lennard, Brooklyn-based Senior News Analyst for Vice News, VICE News, October 27, 2014, ""'Lone Wolf' Terrorist Acts Will Be Used to Justify the Surveillance State"" https://news.vice.com..., accessed 7/17/15 JH @ DDI) The phenomenon of individuals committing violent and murderous acts in the name of an ideology is nothing new in the US. The FBI's Operation Lone Wolf investigated white supremacists encouraging autonomous violent acts in the 1990s. Why, then, are we seeing pundits and politicians newly focus on the ""lone wolf"" category? There's no simple answer, but we can at the very least see that the old binary, distinguishing terror as the act of networked groups versus lone madman mass killings "" a distinction that has tacitly undergirded post-9/11 conceptions of terrorism "" doesn't serve the latest iteration of the war on terror. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, speaking on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, suggested that ""the Internet, as well as certain specific Muslim extremists, are really firing up this lone-wolf phenomenon."" Whether intentionally or not, the Senate Intelligence Committee chair performed a lot of political work with that one comment. Crystallizing ""lone wolves"" as a key threat domestically helps legitimize the US's current military operation against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. With or without established connections, the Islamic State's far-reaching tentacles of online influence encouraging individuals worldwide cement the group as a threat to the homeland "" which is always useful for politicians struggling to legally justify another protracted war. In this way, attributing attacks to homegrown ""lone wolves"" is more useful for current US political interests than attributing them to madness alone. The assumption that terror acts were always borne of connected networks problematically buoyed domestic counter-terror efforts that saw entire communities profiled as potential threats. Which is not to say that ""lone wolf terrorist"" is a flawed designation for attacks by ideologically motivated individuals. In many ways it seems apt, and any challenge is welcome to the all too basic distinction that imbues group terror with motive while dismissing individual acts as madness. The ""lone wolf"" straddles the ill-conceived gap between madman and terrorist node. It's an intersection all too complicated for the inexpert punditry of Fox News: ""They are terrorist acts, to be sure,"" Megyn Kelly said about Canadian gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, adding ""but this guy was also a nutcase."" Furthermore, the assumption that terror acts were always borne of connected networks problematically buoyed domestic counter-terror efforts that saw entire communities profiled as potential threats. Under the premise that terror networks ran like arteries through US Muslim communities enabled an era of profile-driven preemptive policing that has been nothing short of racist. Entire mosques in New York were designated terrorist organizations to enable police surveillance. The NSA's meta-data collections claim justifiability on the premise that terror was locatable by tracing networks of communication. The ""lone wolf"" phenomenon should at least prompt the questioning of the sort of profile-based counter-terror efforts that assumed terror lurked in any network of Muslims, and that the mass hoarding of communications data was vital to national security. However, the rhetoric surrounding this type of domestic threat already bodes ill for civil liberties. If the hunt for terrorist networks has been plagued by ethnic profiling and overreaching spycraft, an established threat of ""lone wolf"" attacks gives a defensive imprimatur for unbounded NSA-style surveillance "" anyone can wield a hatchet with ideological ire. As Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul said on This Week, finding such lone actors in advance of attacks is like ""finding a needle in a haystack."" And as Feinstein said the same day, ""You have to be able to watch it, and you have to be able to disrupt them."" As such, the era of the ""lone wolf"" terrorist does not only spell the end of the bunk distinction between motivated group and deranged individual. It ushers in the dawn of a new era of justification for our totalized state of surveillance and national security paranoia. Surveillance would increase after a terrorist attack Feaver 1/13/15 (Peter D., 1/13/15, Foreign Policy, ""10 Lessons to Remember After a Terrorist Attack,"" Peter is a professor of political science and public policy and Bass Fellow @ Duke University, and director of the Triangle Institute for Security Studies and the Duke Program in American Grand Strategy, http://foreignpolicy.com..., 7/16/15, SM) In particular, it is striking how some of the things that were ""obvious"" in the days and weeks after 9/11, but then were gradually forgotten, have become obvious again:W06; Terrorists succeed when they are abetted by intelligence failures. Or, put another way, terrorists only need to get lucky once to ""succeed,"" whereas counterterrorism has to be lucky all the time to ""succeed.""W06; Even robust intelligence and law enforcement may not guarantee 100 percent safety and security. By global standards "" certainly by the standards of Western democracies "" France has a particularly formidable counterterrorist structure. But it failed in this instance.W06; When terrorists succeed in an attack, citizens demand that the government do more to protect them "" even if they have already been doing a lot. And steps that would have seemed heavy handed before the attack, say aggressive surveillance of suspected terrorists or visible demonstrations of presence by the security forces, are deemed not just tolerable but necessary. Moreover, savvy political leaders will understand that one of the benefits of a stronger official response is that it is a hedge both against dangerously stronger vigilantism and also against additional pressure from some segments of the public to do more than is wise. Terrorism leads to crackdowns History.com, Reaction to 9/11, http://www.history.com..., 2010 ""Today,"" the French newspaper Le Monde announced on September 12, 2001, ""we are all Americans."" People around the world agreed: The terrorist attacks of the previous day had felt like attacks on everyone, everywhere. They provoked an unprecedented expression of shock, horror, solidarity and sympathy for the victims and their families. Citizens of 78 countries died in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on September 11, and people around the world mourned lost friends and neighbors. They held candlelight vigils. They donated money and goods to the Red Cross and other rescue and relief organizations. Flowers piled up in front of American embassies. Cities and countries commemorated the attacks in a variety of ways: The Queen Mother sang the American national anthem at Buckingham Palace""s Changing of the Guard, while in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro put up huge billboards that showed the city""s famous Christ the Redeemer statue embracing the New York City skyline. Meanwhile, statesmen and women rushed to condemn the attacks and to offer whatever aid they could to the United States. Russian president Vladimir Putin called the strikes ""a blatant challenge to humanity,"" while German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder declared that the events were ""not only attacks on the people in the United States, our friends in America, but also against the entire civilized world, against our own freedom, against our own values, values which we share with the American people."" He added, ""We will not let these values be destroyed."" Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien denounced the ""cowardly and depraved assault."" He tightened security along the border and arranged for hundreds of grounded airplanes to land at Canadian airports. Even leaders of countries that did not tend to get along terribly well with the American government expressed their sorrow and dismay. The Cuban foreign minister offered airspace and airports to American planes. Chinese and Iranian officials sent their condolences. And the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, visibly dismayed, told reporters in Gaza that the attacks were ""unbelievable, unbelievable, unbelievable."" ""We completely condemn this very dangerous attack,"" he said, ""and I convey my condolences to the American people, to the American president and to the American administration."" But public reaction was mixed. The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas announced that ""no doubt this is a result of the injustice the U.S. practices against the weak in the world."" Likewise, people in many different countries believed that the attacks were a consequence of America""s cultural hegemony, political meddling in the Middle East and interventionism in world affairs. The Rio billboards hadn""t been up for long before someone defaced them with the slogan ""The U.S. is the enemy of peace."" Some, especially in Arab countries, openly celebrated the attacks. But most people, even those who believed that the United States was partially or entirely responsible for its own misfortune, still expressed sorrow and anger at the deaths of innocent people. On September 12, the 19 ambassadors of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) declared that the attack on the United States was an attack on all of the member nations. This statement of solidarity was mostly symbolic""NATO did not authorize any specific military action""but it was still unprecedented. It was the first time that the organization had ever invoked the mutual defense section of its charter (intended to protect vulnerable European nations from Soviet invasion during the Cold War). NATO eventually sent five airplanes to help keep an eye on American airspace. Likewise, on September 12 the United Nations Security Council called on all nations to ""redouble their efforts"" to thwart and prosecute terrorists. Two weeks later, it passed another resolution that urged states to ""suppress the financing of terrorism"" and to aid in any anti-terrorism campaigns. But these declarations of support and solidarity didn""t mean that other countries gave the United States a free hand to retaliate however, and against whomever, it pleased. Allies and adversaries alike urged caution, warning that an indiscriminate or disproportionate reaction could alienate Muslims around the world. In the end, almost 30 nations pledged military support to the United States, and many more offered other kinds of cooperation. Most agreed with George Bush that, after September 11, the fight against terrorism was ""the world""s fight."" Terrorists Hate US Al Qaeda Al Qaeda is expanding and plotting attacks against the West Hubbard 6/9/2015 (Ben, Al Qaeda Tries a New Tactic to Keep Power: Sharing It, www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/world/middleeast/qaeda-yemen-syria-houthis.html) BEIRUT, Lebanon "" After they routed the army in southern Yemen, fighters from Al Qaeda stormed into the city of Al Mukalla, seizing government buildings, releasing jihadists from prison and stealing millions of dollars from the central bank. Then they surprised everyone. Instead of raising their flags and imposing Islamic law, they passed control to a civilian council and gave it a budget to pay salaries, import fuel and hire teams to clean up garbage. The fighters receded into the background, maintaining only a single police station to arbitrate disputes. Al Qaeda""s takeover of Yemen""s fifth-largest city in April was the most direct indication yet that the group""s most potent regional affiliates are evolving after years of American drone strikes killing their leaders and changing to meet the challenge posed by the Islamic State""s competing and land-grabbing model of jihad. While the image of Al Qaeda has long been one of shadowy operatives plotting international attacks from remote hide-outs, its branches in Yemen and Syria are now increasingly making common cause with local groups on the battlefield. In doing so, they are distancing themselves from one of Osama bin Laden""s central precepts: That fighters should focus on the ""far enemy"" in the West and not get bogged down in local insurgencies. In recent weeks, the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen has allied with armed tribes to fight Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, putting that alliance on the same side of the country""s civil war as the United States and Saudi Arabia. In Syria, Qaeda-allied fighters are important members of a rebel coalition against President Bashar al-Assad that includes groups supported by the West. This strategy has clear benefits for a group that has long been near the top of the United States""s list of enemies by allowing it to build local support while providing some cover against the threat of foreign military action. But despite Al Qaeda""s increased involvement in local battles, American officials say the group remains committed to attacking the West, a goal that could be easier to plot from sanctuaries where it enjoys local support. Cooperating with others could also give Al Qaeda a long-term advantage in its competition with the extremists of the Islamic State, analysts said. Since its public break with Al Qaeda last year, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has stolen the jihadist limelight by seizing cities in Syria and Iraq and declaring a caliphate in the territory it controls. This has won it the allegiances of other militant cells from Libya to Afghanistan. The Islamic State has insisted that other groups join it or be considered enemies, a tactic that has alienated many in areas it controls. And its public celebration of violence, including the beheading of Western hostages, helped spur the formation of a United States-led military coalition that is bombing the group. Al Qaeda""s branches in Syria and Yemen have taken a different route, building ties with local groups and refraining from the strict application of Shariah, the legal code of Islam, when faced with local resistance, according to residents of areas where Al Qaeda holds sway. When Al Qaeda took over Al Mukalla in April, it seized government buildings and used trucks to cart off more than $120 million from the central bank, according to the bank""s director, Abdul-Qader Foulihan. That sum could not be independently verified. But it soon passed control to a civilian council, giving it a budget of more than $4 million to provide services, an arrangement that made sense to local officials seeking to serve their people during wartime. ""We are not Qaeda stooges,"" said Abdul-Hakeem bin Mahfood, the council""s secretary general, in a telephone interview. ""We formed the council to avoid the destruction of the city."" While the council pays salaries and distributes fuel, Al Qaeda maintains a police station to settle disputes, residents said. It has so far made no effort to ban smoking or regulate how women dress. Nor has it called itself Al Qaeda, instead using the name the Sons of Hadhramaut to emphasize its ties to the surrounding province. One self-described Qaeda member said that the choice of name was deliberate, recalling that after the group seized territory in southern Yemen in 2011, the country""s military had mobilized to push it out with support from the United States. ""We were in control for a year and six months, we applied God""s law, we created a small state and the whole world saw it, but they did not leave us alone,"" the man said in an interview with a Yemeni television station. ""So we came here with the name the Sons of Hadhramaut, but the people here know who we are."" American officials have long considered the terrorist group""s Yemeni branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the most dangerous to the West. It has sought to carry out attacks against the United States, and it retains sophisticated bomb-making expertise. Now, Yemen""s civil war has given the group an opportunity to expand, analysts said. Can""t deter Al-Qaeda Ignatieff ""4 (Michael Ignatieff, Canadian author, academic and former politician. has held senior academic posts at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard and Toronto, 2004, Princeton University Press, ""the lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror"") The third type of terrorist who might prove undeterrable were they to acquire these weapons is Al Qaeda itself. Unlike terrorists who serve the liberation claims of a particular group of people, Al Qaeda does not depend for its support on a particular population who could be subjected to revenge or retribution following an attack. Thus the attackers on Afghan soil. Once Afghanistan had served its function as a base, it was dispensable as far as Al Qaeda was concerned. Since their goal is not the acquisition of power itself but the punishment of the United States and its strategic allies, they cannot be stopped by political negotiation, concession, or appeasement. Nor are they susceptible to the incentives that make some armed groups conform to the laws of war in order to achieve international recognition or legitimacy. This indifference to incentives and sanctions applies not merely to Al Qaeda but to any cult with charismatic psychopaths at its head. It is hard to see what political action a state could have taken to deter the Japanese cult group Aum Shinrikyo before it released toxic agents in the Tokyo subway system. 9 Unlike political groups seeking liberation or national territory, these cults cannot be engaged politically, and since they are closed and conspiratorial, they are difficult to infiltrate and neutralize. The logic of deterrence that once kept state violence in some kind of check has no traction with loners and the cult leaders of global terrorism. Since they promise their followers eternal life, they create a cadre of undeterrables. Standard rationality doesn""t apply to Al-Qaeda "" they cannot be deterred Ignatieff ""4 (Michael Ignatieff, Canadian author, academic and former politician. has held senior academic posts at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard and Toronto, 2004, Princeton University Press, ""the lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror"") In the examples considered so far, it has become clear that where armed groups have a real prospect of obtaining recognition and statehood, they may be persuaded to abstain from terrorism. Where their success in this struggle depends on retaining the support of local populations, they may also conclude that restraint pays better than atrocity. But these incentives and restraining factors do not apply to all terrorist groups. No such factors discipline the conduct of Al Qaeda. They have no aspirations to statehood and therefore no incentive to play by any known rules. They do not serve a determinate population and are therefore unconstrained either by their supporters"" moral code or by their vulnerability to reprisal. They even appear indifferent to casualties inflicted on Muslim populations who live or work in proximity to their targets. This is what makes them so dangerous. This is also why they cannot be engaged politically and must instead be defeated militarily. Al Qaeda is therefore a distinctive kind of terrorism, no longer in the service of a people""s freedom or in the name of the overthrow of a given state. The apocalyptic nihilists who attacked the United States on September 11 did not leave behind justifications, noble or otherwise, for their actions. They directed their propaganda and their justifications not at a specific state denying a claim to self-determination, but at the United States as the hated imperial capital of a materialistic, secular, and alien civilization. The so-called martyrs defended their actions in the language of Islamic eschatology, not in the language of rights. 33 Moreover, their intentions were apocalyptic, not political: to humiliate the archenemy of Islam and secure martyrdom in the process. It is difficult to see, in principle, how acts unaccompanied by demands can be accommodated politically. If the goal of terrorism is neither territory nor freedom, if its purpose is to strike a blow that asserts the dignity of Muslim believers while inflicting horror and death upon their enemies, then it is difficult to envisage a political response of any kind. Such an attack cannot be met by politics but only by war. Generic Biological realism explains terrorism "" means it""s impossible to stop it Thayer and Hudson ""11 (Brad and Valerie, Thayer is a Professor of Political Science at Baylor, Hudson is the Professor of Political Science at Brigham Young. ""Sex and the Shaheed: Insights from the Life Sciences on Islamic Suicide Terrorism"" International Security, Vol 34 No 4. 2011) Yet, even if al-Qaida is diminished, Islamic fundamentalist suicide attacks will continue to be executed by al-Qaida-inspired groups, Palestinian terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, and the Taliban because they are an effective asymmetric tactic against some of the world""s most hardened security forces. Islamic fundamentalist suicide terrorists have penetrated British, French, Israeli, and U.S. defenses, among others. Moreover, only suicide terrorists could have executed the September 11 attacks or penetrated the Israeli security corridor bordering the Palestinian Authority, because they alone could navigate the countless security obstacles and be capable of self-destructing at a precise location and time while causing the greatest damage. As Mustafa Alani puts it, ""It""s what we call a thinking, walking bomb. He watches the whole scene [and] chooses the best time and best location.""4 Suicide terrorism is the ultimate smart bomb, demonstrating unparalleled political commitment and personal resoluteness. Scholars have examined Islamic fundamentalist suicide terrorism primarily through the lens of international politics, economics, and cultural studies, and each offers important insights into the motivation and recruitment policies of groups that practice it. There is, however, another discipline that can make a useful contribution""the life sciences. We argue that the application of concepts and approaches from the life sciences yields new insights into (1) the causal context of Islamic fundamentalist suicide terrorism, (2) the motivation of suicide terrorists, and (3) policy approaches to subvert this form of terrorism. A consilient approach, incorporating ideas from the life sciences and the social sciences, can aid social scientists and policy analysts in addressing the problem of Islamic suicide terrorism.5 The life sciences can be a source of new analogies and examples that might help scholars and analysts to approach the problem in fresh ways and derive effective policies.6 Our argument is important for three reasons. First, understanding the motivations of Islamic fundamentalist terrorists is critical for creating policies to stop them, ideally before they become terrorists. Second, our approach helps to illuminate why few Islamic fundamentalist terrorists defect and how policies may be crafted to promote defections. Finally, it advances the goal of consilience""that is, using insights from human evolution and ecology, as well as from the social sciences, to create a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of human behavior. In essence, consilient approaches bridge the gap between the life sciences and the social sciences. For the advancement of knowledge concerning human behavior, there may be no more important task than removing the barriers between the life sciences and the social sciences, which we believe will revolutionize both fields of study.7 The evolutionary structure of terrorist organizations makes them impossible to deter Thayer and Hudson ""11 (Brad and Valerie, Thayer is a Professor of Political Science at Baylor, Hudson is the Professor of Political Science at Brigham Young. ""Sex and the Shaheed: Insights from the Life Sciences on Islamic Suicide Terrorism"" International Security, Vol 34 No 4. 2011) Alpha males try to resolve this inevitable tension through male bonding. By persuading non-alpha males that they are all ""family,"" alpha males may be able to dampen intragroup tensions. Evolutionary psychology also helps to explain why this strategy will be effective. Humans evolved in small-group dominance hierarchies""principally the family and extended family hunter groups. Accordingly, the human mind is well suited for comprehending and bonding with small groups of dozens or, at most, 100 or 150 people.24 To be sure, humans may bond with larger units (e.g., a country), but that requires an extensive effort by the state (e.g., years of nationalistic education). In mimicking the family bond, male-bonded groups often assume the task of educating young males, providing another family-like service. Young people often embrace indoctrination into a belief system through a religion or an educational system, or the combination of the two, such as in madrassas.25 Emulating the family also makes the male-bonded group more resilient""harder to penetrate and to destroy""similar to the family or the mafia and suggests they must be targeted in unique ways. The dynamics described above are found among all societies, not only those of the Islamic world. Alpha males will seek to co-opt non-alpha males into male-bonded societies in which violence is controlled by alphas and guided toward out-groups, not in-groups (and especially not targeted toward the alphas). In this study, however, we limit ourselves to examining factors that we argue contribute to Islamic fundamentalist suicide terrorism. Of course, even within the Islamic world, individuals will possess other motivations to conduct suicide attacks. For example, there is evidence that at least some Iraqi male teenagers have been forced to train as suicide bombers under fear of reprisals against their families. Terrorism""s engrained in Islamic societies "" it""s the only way for non-Alpha males to achieve status Thayer and Hudson ""11 (Brad and Valerie, Thayer is a Professor of Political Science at Baylor, Hudson is the Professor of Political Science at Brigham Young. ""Sex and the Shaheed: Insights from the Life Sciences on Islamic Suicide Terrorism"" International Security, Vol 34 No 4. 2011) Baldly put, polygyny means mates for some men and none for others. And who will not obtain mates? It will not be those with advantages, but rather those who lack them. Non-alpha males will be the reproductive losers, and this gives them great motivation to use force, the sole area in which they possibly hold a reproductively relevant advantage over alpha males. Alpha males and non-alpha males understand the ramifications of polygyny for their relations: polygyny will heighten in-group violence against alpha males by non-alpha males absent a mechanism that directs this violence to an out-group. From the perspective of alpha males, suicide terrorism offers some interesting possibilities. A non-alpha male in a polygynous society with high levels of gender differentiation wants to find a way to project power, preferably through violence. In this way, he hopes to obtain greater social status and thus greater reproductive success. An alpha male in the same society wants to find a way to channel that violence to out-groups without allowing the nonalpha male to achieve social status through violence, which ultimately could threaten the interests of the alpha males. Suicide terrorism, sanctioned and applauded by religious belief, represents an attractive strategy in this context. If alpha males can persuade non-alpha males that (1) their violence should be directed to out-groups, (2) that thereby these non-alpha males will greatly increase their social status and make their families proud, but (3) they will have to die and experience their reproductive success vicariously through their kin, or in the afterlife, then the threat of in-group violence can be decreased. For some non-alpha males, becoming a shaheed is the most effective response to the human evolutionary conundrum produced by male dominance hierarchies, high levels of gender differentiation, and the scarcity of females resulting from polygyny.40 In 2003 Robert Pape found that among Islamic suicide terrorists, 97 percent were single and 84 percent were male. If one excludes the Kurdistan Workers"" Party, which promotes gender equality, the gender ratio rises to 91 percent.41 These young men come predominantly from lower socio-economic strata of society than those involved in nonsuicide terrorism, despite the somewhat anomalous case of the September 11 attacks. Evolutionary psychology would predict that this subpopulation would be most susceptible to the lure of suicide terrorism. Islamic religious texts promise the shaheed seventy-two virgins in the afterlife. 42 Miller and Kanazawa note, ""It is the combination of polygyny and the promise of a large harem of virgins in heaven that motivate many young Muslim men to commit suicide bombings. Consistent with this explanation, all studies of suicide bombers indicate that they are significantly younger than not only the Muslim population in general but other (nonsuicidal) members of their own extreme political organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. And nearly all suicide bombers are single.""43 Failed suicide bombers may not admit to this temptation as motivation for their action, perhaps considering it too vulgar or impious. Nevertheless, it can be a key draw for a male contemplating poor reproductive prospects in this life. In March 2004, Husam Abdu (also Abdo), a sixteen-year-old failed suicide bomber captured at an Israeli checkpoint in Gaza, explained to Israeli intelligence officials that his dwarfism made him the object of ridicule at school, and he had been tempted by the promise of sexual relations with virgins in paradise. 44 Another captured would-be suicide terrorist, a Moroccan man, aged twenty-six, suffered from facial disfigurement.45 A study of suicide bombers in Iraq conducted by the U.S. military found that they were almost always single males from eighteen to thirty, with a mean age of twenty-two and no children. 46 The study concluded that most are ""alienated young men from large families who are desperate to stand out from the crowd and make their mark.""47 Immigration DA (WIP) tag Levy 6-3 (Gabrielle, Capitol Hill analyst at US News, ""Signs of Life For Immigration Reform,"" June 3 2015, http://www.usnews.com...) With comprehensive immigration reform essentially dead on Capitol Hill for the foreseeable future, Republicans appear poised to advance a series of incremental measures to address the hot-button issue amid political pressure to tackle the broken system. W06; GOP lawmakers in recent weeks have proposed potential areas of compromise they hope can help the party handle the delicate balance between appeasing the demands of the base in beefing up border security while addressing the practical economic need for foreign labor.W06; The moves come amid almost no progress on immigration legislation since the then-Democratically controlled Senate passed a comprehensive reform bill in 2013 that never came up for a vote in the GOP-led House. The impasse led President Barack Obama to issue executive orders protecting some groups of immigrants living illegally in the U.S. from deportation "" infuriating Republicans in the process.W06; With the unilateral moves halted by a federal judge, congressional leadership has been content to sidestep the thorny issue after losing a faceoff in March in which they unsuccessfully tried to tie funding for the Department of Homeland Security to a rollback of the Obama actions. But the looming presidential race has increased the sense of urgency among some of the rank and file eager to see the party raise its standing among Hispanic voters.W06; ""If you""re a Republican [running for president], you at minimum want the immigration issue neutralized, and maybe gain votes where Mitt Romney was unable to get them"" in 2012, says Stuart Anderson, executive director of the nonpartisan, nonprofit National Foundation for American Policy.W06; While any of the the piecemeal proposals faces long odds to passage and even less chance of cooperation with the White House, one area of focus appears to be on guest worker programs that would increase the number and accessibility of visas for both high- and low-skilled workers.

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has also gained some interest from advocates on both sides of the aisle.

Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

67	Sdc228044-A42f4934e	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	That terrorism meets it's goals.	Before any argument is put forward, a definition is a necessity in this debate. The word 'goals' is certainly a word that needs explaining. Terrorists, or freedom fighter's goals are not to incite terror, or fear, as many would suggest. In fact, terror is just used as a weapon to achieve alternative goals. These goals are usually either; an attempt to gain awareness, to aid the process of social upheaval, or quite simply, to destroy, and in doing so, send a powerful message. So, with the definition in place, we can begin. I will give two recent examples of terrorism meeting its goals, and an explanation of how and why. My first example is quite controversial, but extremely relevant, and topical; the 9/11 attacks. The terrorist's goals on this occasion were quite clear. To attack the most powerful nation in the world, and in the process, send a chilling message. The world is no longer afraid of you America, they are those of us who can and will stand up to your domineering imperialism. And they succeeded in spectacular fashion. The attacks devastated the American psyche, and began 'The War on Terror'. But the big thing was that America became horribly scared of small militant groups or nations. My second example is terrorism on completely the other side of the spectrum. When Che Guevara, Fidel Castro and a group of around 80 guerrillas invaded Cuba, and set about taking on the oppressive dictatorship of Batista, killing hundreds as they went, they committed acts of terrorism. Their terrorism was classified as a social uprising in a violent form. And it certainly met its goals, a communist revolution took place, and the people were freed from the previous aggressive dictatorship. As you can see from these examples, and there are many, many more, terrorism nearly always meets its goals.	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

67	Sb82e1d37-A6b9e0e7a	0	1	Can terrorism be justified?	17. In matters of collecting military intelligence, the ends justify the means.	Thanks to Jokerdude for doing this debate and thanks to the judges for judging. I will now move on to my constructive speech. The idea that my opponent and this resolution try to suggest is just plan wrong. The ideas of consequentialism and utilitarianism are inherently flawed. The reason PRO uses these means is to serve the greater good. However, that does still not justify doing whatever it takes to get the intelligence. For example, if the US found a terrorist hideout, it would not be justified to bomb them. Sure, possibly more people could be saved in the US, but let's think about this. Why does the US want the greater good for its people? Because human life is the greatest gift we have. The US would not bomb its own people, so what makes it different if the US bombs them? It is still killing: something that the US was trying to prevent. Now, instead of Americans being killed, it's terrorists, but they're still dead people. Let's look at this terrorist example again. Say there's a suspected terrorist that the US has. Sure, he could know where the bombs are, but what if he doesn't? Allow me to explain further: the term 'suspected' implies that it isn't confirmed that the person is a terrorist. Therefore, there are numerous cases where the person isn't a terrorist. If you've seen the movie 'Rendition' (http://www.imdb.com...), it follows the true story of Khalid El-Masri who was tortured for information about a terrorist plot. They had calls from 'his' cell phone to a man that later suicide bombed a town square. While being tortured, he finally gave information because he was in so much pain. We find out Khalid El-Masri is mistaken for Khalid al-Masri, a known al-Qaeda member. This instance clearly shows how it is unjust to torture people and use ends to justify said torture. Think how many people could be in the same situation (http://en.wikipedia.org...). This would only lead to more terrorists and prolonged war, the opposite of what PRO wants. Clearly, PRO's justification is wrong. Okay, let's take a look at some other examples of 'ends justifying the means'. Wiretapping is a new issue and is broad enough to be brought into this debate. The US government wants to listen to and read everyone's calls, mail, texts, and e-mails. This is unjustified because everyone has some right to privacy. Where do I get this, you say? The United States Constitution. The 4th amendment protects us from searches and seizures without proper warrant. I am not a terrorist, so I see no warrant or reason whatsoever for them to be looking at my mail. In fact, the amendment was put in place by our forefathers so they couldn't do that very thing. This same concept can be applied to numerous things regarding this resolution, so do NOT accept anything that can be applied to this argument. Now I will give you an example of my own. Say a proverbial nation wanted to build another atomic bomb. They would need a team of scientists to do this. So they go out and ask a group of well known nuclear physicists. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), the scientists refuse, because they think it's wrong. The government does not accept that answer. They make a deal: either they build the bomb, or they die. This is the most plain-out-and-simple example of how wrong the resolution is. Scientists are doing something against their will for something that will kill millions of people. Otherwise, they will die, and that is in no way justified. I can't make it any clearer. All in all, I negate this resolution on two main premises: 1. The philosophies of consequentialism and utilitarianism do not justify means. 2. The practical examples of the resolution are wrong. With that said, I urge you to vote CON.	CON	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	Sa41aaeb5-Ad85e1bc7	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	The War On Terror is justifiable and effective.	"Thank you for starting an interesting debate. The War on Terror that has followed the 9-11 attacks is not only justifiable and effective, it was and remains the only solution to the threat posed by militant Islamic fundamentalism. The War on Terror is justifiable. 1. To prove that the war is justifiable, I must prove that the cause of it merited action, and that the action taken was the correct one. The causes of the war on terror have been not only the September 11th, 2001 attacks that left thousands of American civilians dead, but the bombings in Madrid and in London as well. The 9/11 attacks were the original cause of the war; the subsequent bombings the cause to continue it. The 9/11 attacks are to the war on terror what Pearl Harbor was to the Pacific Theater of World War II. My opponent argues that war is never justified except in extreme circumstances, ""arbitrary provocation or attack from a hostile power with no reasonable alternative."" If my opponent believes that Pearl Harbor was arbitrary attack from a hostile power, he must believe that World War II was justified; at least in the Pacific theater. If he accepts that 9/11 was equivalent to Pearl Harbor, it follows that he must also accept the War on Terror as justified. 9/11 is equivalent to Pearl Harbor because both were arbitrary, preemptive provocation and attack from a hostile power--and in neither case was a reasonable alternative to warfare found. If anything, 9/11 was far worse an attack than Pearl Harbor because (1) the targets were almost entirely civilians, and (2) the tactics used are equivalent to armies from centuries past marching with hostages in front of them to act as a shield. So, if my opponent believes that 9/11 was a more atrocious and underhanded attack than Pearl Harbor, and accepts that Pearl Harbor was a just cause for Franklin Roosevelt declaring war on Japan, he must again accept that 9/11 was a just cause for 9/11, making the war on terror justifiable. 2. The war on terror was conceived under the extreme circumstance of the first attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor. 3. The cause of the war was not, in fact, retribution--retribution would mean that we had stooped to the tactics of the Islamic terrorists and said to ourselves, ""The terrorists killed 2752 of our civilians; we must kill 2752 of theirs."" However, it is obvious that US policy has never been to harm civilians in any way. The justification for the war was, in fact, to prevent something similar from happening again. Certainly there was anger, a desire for retribution after the twin towers were destroyed--just as there was at Pearl Harbor and after the sinking of the Lusitania. Did we act primarily out of vengeance? Certainly not. Vengeance has never been a just motive, but the goal of the war on terror was not vengeance. to paraphrase Jeane Kirkpatrick, it was ""making war to keep the peace."" If warfare is ever justifiable, the motive must be to make the world better in some way--such as bringing peace. Warfare is never good--but it is necessary. 4. To prove that preventing a similar occurrence was the motive of the war on terror, we need only look at why people have said it to be effective. They do not say, ""This war was effective because we killed 2752 Muslim civilians."" No, they say, ""This war was effective because we have freed two countries and prevented another terrorist attack on U.S. soil."" For something to be effective, it must fulfill its goal. The latter sentence is frequently used by everyone, in support of the war or against it, as the motive (e.g.: the war on terror was ineffective because it did not prevent terrorist attacks in the rest of the world.) So whether or not the war on terror is effective, it's motive was to prevent a similar attack occurring. If my opponent believes this to be an unjust motive, then we are back to square one. But he must accept that vengeance was not the motive of the war on terror. The War on Terror was effective. 1. The War on Terror has been effective because it has achieved its stated goal of no further terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. My opponent may argue that the military exploits of the US in Iraq and Afghanistan did not contribute to this; that it was instead increased border security post 9/11. This is, however, immaterial because the increased border security, no less than the material drives and arms buildup of World War II, is part of the War on Terror effort, and thus part of the war. So if my opponent accepts that increased border security has been effective in preventing further attacks on U.S. soil, he must accept that the war on terror has been effective in some ways. 2. The War on Terror has freed two nations from cruel dictatorships. The role of the US in the world is controversial, but everyone agrees that our powers should be used for good. So even without the attacks, it may have been justified to invade Iraq and Afghanistan in the interest of increased liberty in the world. The Taliban and the Ba'athists were most certainly not majority, elected governments as we have in the west. My opponent could argue that it is none of our beeswax whether the littler countries in the world languish and die under cruel regimes, and I would say that would contradict the liberal and admirable ideas of a ""united earth"" and compassion to less fortunate people. Remember that Saddam Hussein carried out a chemical weapons attack on his own people, members of the Kurdish minority, that killed almost 10,000 people and is the largest chemical weapons attack on civilians in history. Talibani attacks in 1998 killed 8,000 Afghanis, and women could be beaten for showing any skin besides their hands. This is what we liberated the Iraqi and Afghani peoples from. We have given them the choice of freedom. My conclusion, then, is that the war on terror has been both justifiable and effective (within reason.) My opponent apparently expects war to be without casualties, and that all casualties were unjustly made casualties. This is unrealistic. If war is fought for the right reason, then casualties are regrettable but necessary to achieve the just goal. People are perfectly entitled to have no stomach for warfare; it takes courage to make war. The US and its allies had the courage to make war, and with a few stumbles they have succeeded. Whatever happens in Iraq and Afghanistan after we pull out, we have freed them from some of the worst dictatorships the world has seen; Hitler and Stalin and Mao, but on a smaller scale. And yet my opponent believes that those actions were unjust. I believe he is wrong; and it will be up to the voters to decide. Thanks again for this debate."

67	Sbfb67433-A83d80e7d	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Islam is not a religion of terrorism	"Thank you for accepting this debate. I'm looking forward to debate with you.ArgumentsProphet Muhammed against terrorismMany examples can demonstrate the fact that prophet Muhammed was against terrorism, but because of limited space, I will just give two of them. I think just these two examples is enough to show that prophet Muhammed indeed was against terrorism.1) Some examples of the sayings of prophet Muhammed which is clearly against terrorism.Go to war in adherence to the religion of Allah. Never touch the elderly, women or children. Always improve their situation and be kind to them. Allah loves those who are sincere. (Ahmad).Do not kill children. Avoid touching people who devote themselves to worship in churches! Never murder women and the elderly. Do not set trees on fire or cut them down. Never destroy houses. (Bukhãri). He who kills a non-Muslim (who has a peace treaty) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise, and its smell is sensed from a distance as far as forty years journey. (collected in Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim). I command you not to do ten things, do not kill women, do not kill children, do not kill the elderly, do not destroy trees, do not destroy properties, do not slaughter animals unless it is for food, neither flood or set fire to palm trees, avoid extremism, and do not act cowardly or weak. (Muslim) The first cases to be adjudicated between people on the Day of Judgment will be those of bloodshed. (Muslim and Al-Bukhari)A woman was punished because she imprisoned a cat until it died. On account of this, she was doomed to Hell. While she imprisoned it, she did not give the cat food or drink, nor did she free it to eat the insects of the earth. (Muslim and Al-Bukhari)There is a reward for kindness to every living animal or human. (Muslim and Al-Bukhari)Do not be people without minds of your own, saying that if others treat you well you will treat them well, and that if they do wrong you will do wrong to them. Instead, accustom yourselves to do good if people do good and not to do wrong (even) if they do evil. (Al-Tirmidhi)All creation is the family of God, and the person most beloved by God (is the one) who is kind and caring toward His family. (Muslim and Al-Bukhari)I think these sayings of prophet Muhammed is enough to prove my point. Prophet Muhammed clearly is against terrorism in this sayings, and every rational person knows the conclusion to these sayings. I have to again note that there are of course many more sayings of prophet Muhammed which clearly is against terrorism, but because of limited space, I took only these ones. I think that just these sayings anyway is enough to show that prophet Muhammed was a person who indeed did not promote terrorism.2) When prophet Muhammed entered the town of Makkah with his huge army, the Quraysh people stood before him expecting him to kill them all. The Quraysh people had previously tortured him and his companions, exiled him and brutally killed his dearest relatives. They basically made a living hell for him. But what did the prophet Muhammed do? He forgave them all. Does this seem like a person of terrorism? Would someone who promoted terrorism do this? Clearly not.The Quran against terrorismThere are many verses in the Quran which clearly denounces terrorism. Again, because of limited space, I will just give some of them.when you judge between people, to judge with justice… (Surat an-Nisa', verse 58) Oh you who believe, stand up firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even if it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be against rich or poor; for God can best protect both. Do not follow any passion, lest you not be just. And if you distort or decline to do justice, verily God is well-acquainted with all that you do. (4:135)... if someone kills another person - unless it is in retaliation for someone else or for causing corruption in the earth - it is as if he had murdered all mankind. And if anyone gives life to another person, it is as if he had given life to all mankind. Our Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, but even after that many of them committed outrages in the earth. (Surat al-Ma'ida, 32)But as for those who break Allah's contract after it has been agreed and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and cause corruption in the earth, the curse will be upon them. They will have the Evil Abode. (Surat ar-Ra'd, 25) Eat and drink of Allah's provision and do not go about the earth corrupting it. (Surat al-Baqara, 60)Do not corrupt the earth after it has been put right. Call on Him fearfully and eagerly. Allah's mercy is close to the good-doers. (Surat al-A'raf, 56) Allah does not uphold the works of those who cause mischief. (Surah Yunus, 81)Whenever he holds the upperhand, he goes about the earth corrupting it, destroying (people's) crops and breeding stock. Allah does not love corruption. When he is told to have fear of Allah, he is seized by pride which drives him to wrongdoing. Hell will be enough for him! What an evil resting-place. (Surat al-Baqara, 205-206)As can be seen from the above verses, it is out of question for someone who fears Allah to do a terrorist act. The Quran clearly is against terrorism, as seen from these verses. Unfortunately, some people have picked some verses from the Quran and justified his terrorist actions by it. All those verses due, are just out of context. A Muslim who knows the Quran good, knows that it is against terrorism.ConclusionIt is totally irrational to say that Islam is a religion of terrorism, when its foundations (i,c.. The Quran and the sayings of prophet Muhammad) clearly speaks against it, as seen above. Islam is not a religion of terrorism, but of peace. Even the word ""Islam"" itself is derived from the word ""Peace"".Sources1. http://mercyprophet.org...2. http://www.searchtruth.com...3. http://www.cair.com..."

67	S477abe50-A214c216e	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Islam is not a religion of peace	"Ten Obvious Reasons Why Islam is Not a Religion of Peace #1 18,000 deadly terror attacks committed explicitly in the name of Islam in just the last ten years. (Other religions combined for perhaps a dozen or so). #2 Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, had people killed for insulting him or for criticizing his religion. This included women. Muslims are told to emulate the example of Muhammad. #3 Muhammad said in many places that he has been ""ordered by Allah to fight men until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is his messenger."" In the last nine years of his life, he ordered no less than 65 military campaigns to do exactly that. Muhammad inspired his men to war with the basest of motives, using captured loot, sex and a gluttonous paradise as incentives. He beheaded captives, enslaved children and raped women captured in battle. Again, Muslims are told to emulate the example of Muhammad. #4 After Muhammad died, the people who lived with him and knew his religion best immediately fell into war with each other. Fatima, Muhammad's favorite daughter, survived the early years among the unbelievers at Mecca safe and sound, yet died of stress from the persecution of fellow Muslims only six months after her father died. She even miscarried Muhammad's grandchild after having her ribs broken by the man who became the second caliph. It was the same caliph, Umar, who ordered the death of the first convert to Islam at Medina, an elderly leader who became a close companion to Muhammad and proved his worth in battle. Sa'd ibn Ubadah was killed after a failed bid to be caliph. Fatima's husband Ali, who was the second convert to Islam and was raised like a son to Muhammad, fought a civil war against an army raised by Aisha, Muhammad's favorite wife - and one whom he had said was a ""perfect woman."" 10,000 Muslims were killed in a single battle waged less than 25 years after Muhammad's death. Three of the first four Muslim rulers (caliphs) were murdered. All of them were among Muhammad's closest companions. The third caliph was killed by allies of the son of the first (who was murdered by the fifth caliph a few years later, then wrapped in the skin of a dead donkey and burned). The fourth caliph (Ali) was stabbed to death after a bitter dispute with the fifth. The fifth caliph went on to poison one of Muhammad's two favorite grandsons. The other grandson was later beheaded by the sixth caliph. The infighting and power struggles between Muhammad's family members, closest companions and their children only intensified with time. Within 50 short years of Muhammad's death, even the Kaaba, which had stood for centuries under pagan religion, lay in ruins from internal Muslim war... And that's just the fate of those within the house of Islam! #5 Muhammad directed Muslims to wage war on other religions and bring them under submission to Islam. Within the first few decades following his death, his Arabian companions invaded and conquered Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and Zoroastrian lands. A mere 25 years after Muhammad's death, Muslim armies had captured land and people within the borders of over 28 modern countries outside of Saudi Arabia. #6 Muslims continued their Jihad against other religions for 1400 years, checked only by the ability of non-Muslims to defend themselves. To this day, not a week goes by that Islamic fundamentalists do not attempt to kill Christians, Jews, Hindus and Buddhists explicitly in the name of Allah. None of these other religions are at war with each other. #7 Islam is the only religion that has to retain its membership by formally threatening to kill anyone who leaves. This is according to the example set by Muhammad. #8 Islam teaches that non-Muslims are less than fully human. Muhammad said that Muslims can be put to death for murder, but that a Muslim could never be put to death for killing a non-Muslim. #9 The Quran never once speaks of Allah's love for non-Muslims, but it speaks of Allah's cruelty toward and hatred of non-Muslims more than 500 times. #10 ""Allahu Akbar!

67	S2406689f-A2ba20340	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism is Sometimes Justified	"Terrorism is a relative word. One thats meaning is determined by what side of the given issue you are on. The people we normally think of as terrorists oddly enough define themselves as freedom fighters, armies of the people, and patriots. To their opponents they are terrorists and barbarians. Regardless of who is or who is not a terrorist, is it ever justified? I will say that from our stand point as Americans it is difficult for us to answer that question. We have never faced the harsh environments which often cause the formation of terrorist groups. In Ireland for example, the people were suffering from poverty, exploitation from Britain, discriminatory laws, and a famine. Over hundreds of years these tension began to boil and rage. Eventually the IRA and other similar groups began to emerge in defense of these people. The IRA then began a near century of guerrilla warfare against Britain. I feel that given the circumstances of the parties involved it was completely justified. The people themselves lacked the ability through diplomats to bring about change. They lacked the field army to challenge Britain, they lacked the economy to challenge Britain. I will say that they use terrorism only as a tool in an evolutionary process to achieve their goals. They believed that this was the only way that they had forward to challenge the injustices. Looking at history I doubt very much that any meaningful change could have been brought about without the IRA's use of terror tactics. Now onto the current issue of terrorism. The Islamic jihadists who have mobilized and declared an Islamic call for jihad against the ""west"". Can we conclude that any of their tactics are justified? To you and I perhaps not, but for the people who are taking part in it, thats entirely different. Let me explain for I know many of you out there are wondering why/how I am going to justify their actions. Imagine yourself as a young Palestinian boy/girl. You are growing up in occupied Gaza. You suffer injustice nearly daily. Food is scarce, money, well your family has minimal. You are in a system that will inevitably lead to failure. You grow to harbor hatred for those who inflict this injustice and those who aid in it. Similar to the Irish they feel as though they have no outlets to pursue to achieve their goals. Given that there is no way to defend yourself/country through conventional military service what other options does he/she have? Many will point to Ghandi's peaceful campaign that won India its independence, but the circumstances where much different. India would have cost Britain huge amounts of money to maintain a presence and defend. The British had no lasting need (resources) from India. Israel's very existence comes through removal of Palestinians. One can see how that may lead to violent actions. Imagine being told your family no longer lives here, this is no longer your country. Palestinians have tried repeatedly to pursue a peaceful means. Obviously none of which brought about any lasting peace/change. When left with no other weapons to defend oneself, people can be justified in turning to arms, and terror tactics to bring about the change they desire. From a moral perspective obviously this causes some raised eyebrows. I am not going to attempt to defend attacks on innocent people through bus bombs or indiscriminate killings. I am talking about attacks on economic infrastructure, political figures, and government officials. Basically people who are in direct involvement with the struggle. In the case of Al-Queda they are not defending the freedom of their people of fighting against extreme injustice, they fight simply to fulfill religious goals. They are not confined to a single country or a single enemy, they fight against an ideology. They have legitimate means to stage a peaceful campaign. Terror tactics in that case are not justified. I'll leave it here and give you a chance to respond before going any further."	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	S160b94ce-Ae833c879	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism can be justified	"The framework for this debate is Just War Theory. Just War Theory says it is unjust to kill non-combatants or civilians. Terrorism is defined as the ""deliberate use of violence against non-combatants or civilians in the pursuit of some political goal."" If we remain within the framework of this debate (provided by my opponent), then terrorism cannot be justified. It is, by definition, incompatible with Just War Theory.If my opponent is to show that terrorism is justified, my opponent will have to provide a reason compelling enough to override Just War Theory. To do this, my opponent would have to show (1) that the ""political goal"" of terrorism is good enough to justify the killing of non-combatants, (2) that the ""political goal"" will necessarily follow from acts of terrorism, and (3) that the ""political goal"" cannot be achieved in any other way. The burden is on my opponent, if terrorism is to be justified, to prove each of these three points, neither of which has been argued yet.Just War TheoryJWT establishes a very clear distinction between combatants and non-combatants. A combatant is armed, prepared to die, and therefore an immediate threat. A non-combatant (or civilian) is unarmed, not prepared to die, and therefore not an immediate threat. The moral status of civilians and soldiers is therefore ""categorically and conceptually different"": soldiers are armed, trained, and expected to kill other soldiers, whereas civilians are unarmed, untrained, and prohibited from killing (if a civilian kills someone it is generally considered murder). As such, JWT does not permit the killing of non-combatants. A soldier who turns their weapon on a civilian is the equivalent of a non-combatant who kills a civilian: an act of murder (rather than an act of war).Re: Civilians and Responsibility(A) TaxesThe ""categorical or conceptual difference"" between a citizen who finances a hit man and the hit man himself is the same difference between a citizen who finances a soldier and the soldier himself: both citizens are unarmed and untrained (and therefore not prepared to die), whereas the hit man and soldier are armed, trained (presumably a hit man has been trained), and therefore prepared to die. True, a citizen who finances a hit man is held partially responsible for acts committed by the hit man, but partial responsibility does not justify killing the citizen. The government does not condone the killing of its own citizens just because they financed a hit man; instead, the government arrests and prosecutes citizens for their crimes. If found guilty, they are imprisoned (and in some rare cases where the citizen is responsible for murder, given the death penalty). In no way does financing a hit man justify the out-right killing of the financer. In our society, civilians and non-combatants have a basic, fundamental right to life. This right is inviolable, unless the civilian chooses to become a combatant.There is thus clearly a difference between civilians and soldiers - civilians are non-combatants whereas soldiers are combatants. JWT does not permit the killing of non-combatants, so any action taken against non-combatants during war would be considered murder. Terrorism, as such, is the equivalent of murder. It cannot be justified, even during war.My opponent claims a situation could be conceived where deliberately killing civilians to achieve a political goal (terrorism) would be ""necessary."" Yet my opponent has not provided such a scenario or even hinted at what such a scenario might look like. The burden is on my opponent to prove such a scenario exists. If an act of terrorism is necessary, then it would indeed be justified. But I maintain that no act of terrorism is ever justified because there is always an alternative. It is never necessary to kill non-combatants to win a war, as non-combatants don't pose a threat. If an opposing nation's military is destroyed, the war would be over. There is never a need to kill non-combatants.My opponent says nothing I say should be accepted without ""evidential or logical reasoning."" I'm not sure what this means. If I say that killing non-combatants is not necessary, the burden is on my opponent to prove a single case where it is necessary. JWT clearly states that non-combatants should not be killed during war, so the burden is on my opponent to prove killing non-combatants would be necessary. I don't really see what kind of ""evidential or logical reasoning"" my opponent is looking for here.(B) Civic RepresentationMy opponent agrees that “not all policies acted out by a government will represent the will of its people.” Thus, my opponent claims it is only civilians who ""actively"" support war who are morally responsible. My opponent writes: “My case only posits that (A) some civilians are justified targets of terrorism and (B) that those civilians are ones that either lend financial assistance to the war or who are part of the general will which the government seeks to represent in waging the war.”The problem with civilians who lend financial assistance to war is that (1) not all citizens who pay taxes support war (many of them continue to pay taxes because it is illegal to not pay taxes), and (2) there is no practical mechanism to determine which citizens support war simply by asking whether they pay taxes or not (some people who do not pay taxes support war while some people who do pay taxes oppose war).The problem with targeting civilians who support war through voting, persuading, giving public support, and other such things, is that they nonetheless remain non-combatants. It is a democratic ideal to preserve the freedom of speech, and if we are allowed to kill non-combatants because they voice their opinions publicly, then we have effectively negated the freedom of speech as a democratic ideal. This is not only unacceptable on a political level (what ""political goal"" achieved by terrorism could outweigh protections on free speech?), it is also unacceptable because non-combatants pose no immediate threat by voicing their opinions. If it was seriously thought that voicing an opinion publicly posed a threat, then governments around the world would immediately censor speech. This is obviously not the case.ConclusionI remind my opponent that the burden is on him to prove that JWT should be abandoned in favor of some other framework. It is also my opponent's burden to show (1) that the ""political goal"" of terrorism is good enough to justify the killing of non-combatants, (2) that the ""political goal"" will necessarily follow from acts of terrorism, and (3) that the ""political goal"" cannot be achieved in any other way. This means my opponent must justify terrorism theoretically and empirically - it must not only have a political goal that overrides the killing of non-combatants, but it must also guarantee that this political goal be achieved and that it cannot be achieved in any other way. I personally don't see how this burden can be met, but I look forward to hearing my opponent's arguments otherwise."	CON	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	S2406689f-Ac1a734c0	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism is Sometimes Justified	"For the purpose of this debate the definition of terror will be as followed:Terrorism, in the modern sense,[1] is violence, the threat of violence, or other harmful acts committed for political or ideological goals.[2] Most definitions of terrorism include only those acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for an ideological goal (as opposed to a lone attack), and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (civilians). Many definitions also include only acts of unlawful violence.(http://en.wikipedia.org...) You had just said that I must justify murder, yet I don't believe I do. Is it considered murder when a soldier dies in a war? I feel the term ""murder"" may be very subjective in this case. It depends on what side of the issue you were on as to whether you would view ""terror"" acts as murder, or casualties of war. That aside I will still go forth and justify the acts of violence and in some cases even killings. Killings: Although the most extreme method of terror, it is often employed to send the ultimate message. Often times this tactic is reserved for the most important targets. I will not advocate indiscriminate killings as I do not see it as justifiable in any sense. For the purpose of this argument I am referring to simply political/military/economic targets. Since at its most fundamental base terrorism aims to achieve a political or military victory it would be fair to say that the immediate targets to achieving such an aim would be the targets I mentioned above. In the case of the Irish Conflict many secret communications had been made over the years. Both the IRA and its split-off groups had attempted on numerous occasions to resolve their differences through dialog. As it became apparent to them through the inaction of the British government, and the refusals on key issues the need for further fighting had become inevitable. Like any government engaged in diplomacy dialog was considered the first step. What are these people to do when diplomacy leads to no results? In matters of freedom time is something that people don't have. Left with no further options, and having exhausted every other avenue of dialog they were left with no choice. The injustice that they were being exposed to could no longer be tolerated. In this circumstance the people were left with no other way. The only language they knew the British would listen to was violence. Moving away from the dialog and into the war end of the struggle new tactics had to be furnished. Many of these revised tactics led to sniping operations, bombings of economic interests, and assassinations of political figures. Can this be justified? Yes. It is justified in that they are fighting a war of freedom. It is no different than any peoples fighting injustice and having to resort to extreme measures to wage that fight. The people dying are those who stand in the way of the achievement of the given goals. In this case it is more of a matter of war, than a matter of terror. When the aim is to achieve the freedom/equality/justice that people are inherently entitled to, then the deaths of men/women who perpetrate these evils is justified. I am basically arguing that ""terrorism"" is as a last resort justified. In history many revolutions have taken place that required violence be used. Without these revolutions much of the progress we have in ways of liberty/freedom/justice would be lost. In many cases it is the only option people have. Will people die as a result? Yes. Innocents? Yes. If we are to argue that terrorism is not a ""war"" between two parties, and that its actions constitute murder than we must reaccess our definitions of war, and murder. In theory any intentional killing of another human being is murder. Are we to prosecute military pilots whose bombs go astray and kill hundreds? Of course not, they are in a war, people die. Well the same can be said with regards to terrorism. To the parties involved it is a war. The government of Britain had no problems with executing the IRA prisoners, of torturing prisoners during interrogations. They considered it a war, and in war nothing is pretty. I feel terrorism is just another name for war. For those who agree with the ""terrorists"" aims they are nothing more than freedom fighters. To their enemies they are terrorists. They are justified in doing anything necessary to achieve their aims given their inability to use alternative legitimate measures to achieve their goals. Since the lack the ability to conduct the battle in any other way they are justified in the tactics they must employ."	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

Therefore, terrorism is justified by its success in achieving results when peaceful means have failed. In many countries terrorists have succeeded in bringing governments to negotiate with them and make concessions to them. Where governments have not been willing to concede to rational argument and peaceful protest, terrorism can compel recognition of a cause. Nelson Mandela moved from terrorist to President.

67	S37e9fe07-Aa8e11a88	0	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	S3cb7f0d9-Aca7edcc0	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Pick your debate - 4/5 topics	"""Terrorism is the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion.[1] At present, there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism.[2][3] Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for an ideological goal (as opposed to a lone attack), and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants."" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terrorism is not the struggle of people for determination, or revolution, or rebellion. Terrorism is cowardly fear mongering, propaganda, kidnapping and murder to scare a government or a people into submission. The blatant disregard for human life that terrorists adhere to, whether deliberately taking it, or disregarding the safety of the innocent, is unethical and therefore unjust. It all comes down to one key statement: It is unethical to do harm to an innocent human being, no matter what the motivator. In war, the volunteered army of one nation and another nation engage in combat only if certain criteria are met (if the soldiers are not volunteered, it is an unjust war). All other methods of resolution must be exercised before violent ones come to the table, and even during war, ethical standards must hold up in order to comply to the morality of justice. (Geneva Convention: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org...) Again, I must clarify that terrorism is a different sort of act of violence unlike like a military war where one strategically attacks another's army. Again, this is through standards of morality in voluntary combat engagement (you volunteer to give up your life, and so does the other side in times of just war). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One might agree with Businessman Ted Turner when he said, ""The reason that the World Trade Center got hit is because there are a lot of people living in abject poverty out there who don't have any hope for a better life."" Poverty is not the root cause of terrorism. It is ideas that cause terrorism. A desire to slaughter innocent, productive human beings cannot be explained by a lack of money or a poor quality of life--only by anti-wealth, anti-life philosophies where an idea is put above the right to life of innocent human beings. So long as we wish to uphold the morality of preserving life above all, we must never, under any circumstances, initiate violence against another human being. When one human being can dub their moral cause mighter than another's innocent life, they have disqualified their ability to be a moral, reasoning human being. One can never claim justice by destroying a fundamental human right. Terrorism is a means of coercion. As was put very nicely by the philosopher Ayn Rand: ""Be it a highwayman who confronts a traveler with the ultimatum: ""Your money or your life,"" or a politician who confronts a country with the ultimatum: ""Your children's education or your life,"" the meaning of that ultimatum is: ""Your mind or your life""—and neither is possible to man without the other."" As we can see, terror is a means to coercion is anti-life, anti-rights, and anti-reasoning."	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

In second story in this series, Cottage Cart, the hero crosses the moat and enters the cottage in which a maiden sits beside a stack of woven cloth. With all this cloth I've woven here, aid me to that castle. The king will surely pay us well, weaving is not facile. Yet all must come with us at once, leave none for fear of theft. Perhaps you need repair the cart, this is too much to heft. One cart wheel fell from its axle, its washer broke apart. Metal fatigue on rough terrain, makes jostling an art. The cottage contains: • a fireplace – unlit, but prepared with logs stacked on kindling • a loom – mostly wood, but powered by a steel foot pedal • a handcart – which seems to be missing a wheel Behind the loom rests a tool chest. The tool chest contains: • a new washer – a disc with a hole in the middle, like a flat donut • a pair of tongs – iron and look like pliers with long handles • a glove – thick leather with a long sleeve By the fireplace is a chunk of flint. Closer inspection of reveals that: • the flint is an egg-size sedimentary rock • the glove is like the kind used by a blacksmith • the new washer is like the axle washers, but slightly too small for the axle In Round 4 I will introduce the third story in this series.

It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

67	S1f30369f-A96c12575	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Warr on Terror	"C1: The war on Terror is deadly My opponent concedes the point by saying every war is deadly, but the wars he cited (well WWII) was justified, the others are debatable. But we must ask, is the war on terror justified? The fact that all wars are deadly is irrelevant, we must ask if the loss of life is justifiable. If (throughout this debate) I prove is unjustified, then it is a waste of life and the point stands. So really this contention now relies on your overall arguments as well as mine. My opponent then concedes the whole debate: ""So in breif, war on terror sÃ­ es bueno..."" And then my opponent takes a step further saying invading their country does mean they will be more aggressive, you claim acts of violence will increase. So in all reality so far you are just handing me the arguments in C1, I guess I can appreciate that. Then my opponent says they already hated us, etc. Now, I will not deny they pre hated us, but I contend the war on terror made it WORSE. Its like someone hates you, if you hit their face they will likely hate you more. There are many anger related angers, so to speak, but one of them is called sudden or hasty anger. This anger is made on decisions that are meant for SELF PRESERVATION. [1] Now, being invaded threatens your feeling, it makes you worried, and you will likely be meaner to the invaders then before they decided to flatten a few towns. This type anger happens when they are tormented or trapped. Many might feel trapped if invaded. The second type of anger is settled and deliberate. This action is perceived from deliberate harms taken against you or loved ones.[1] This is a large component of terrorism, and us invading them is a way for terrorists to use the new anger (this anger will be used to gain new members) as the invasion[s] will trigger this emotion. Then the last type of anger is due to personality types. Your argument is correct, they already hated us, but the basic types of anger[1] made it escalate. You must now refute psychology. So let me linger on the beginning of my opponents refutation to this on all wars are bad, and I argued this does not matter unless he proves this specifics wars death justified. ""The non-aggression principle (also called the non-aggression axiom, the anti-coercion principle, the zero aggression principle, the non-initiation of force), or NAP for short, is a moral stance which asserts that aggression is inherently illegitimate.""[2]Note the part where aggression is unjustified. Now, my opponents case is it is justified as it is in defense, they killed 2000 of us. The war on terror (as stated) kills even more of us and also kills innocent civilians. As defense is, in my opinion, NOT justified if there are foreseeable harms that will likely occur to innocent people (wars always hurt innocents). As this is the case it is still unjustifiable, and it is harder to justify as it has bad effects on freedom. C2: FreedomMy opponent here (not to be rude) actually shows constitution illiteracy, as my opponents arguments fail to see the things he claimed save his argument: circumstances. It was always unconstitutional to have slaves, but when you have half of the country owning slaves it is nearly impossible to do anything without enforcing it. Based on the courts, slavery always unconstitutional (once they defined the 8th amendment). [3] But this fails to prove his point, as circumstances DO NOT trump the constitution. Also, my opponent argument fails as it needs to define punishment. Punishment is defined as retribution towards poor behavior. [4] So, really slavery is constitutional under 8th amendment purposes, BUT is unconstitutional under other parts of the amendments. So really, circumstances should not dictate the constitution, hence your argument mainly dodges my point. Then you show FBI interrogations. The FBI does non coercive interrogations (so you can say no) and actually cant torture you based on constitutional grounds. [5] Hence your argument fails on a factual basis, the constitution trumps interrogation no matter the circumstance. Hence the ""law of the land"" trumps all. SO the argument fails. And yes, I have already proven the war on terror liberty eating, it erodes freedom. It essentially burns the 5th amendment, and it eats and poops out the 4th amendment, that is liberty eating. Also ""saving lives"" has nothing to do with liberty, and the war on terror cant even accomplish that goal either. “As can be seen, annual terrorism fatality risks, particularly for areas outside of war zones, are less than one in one million and therefore generally lie within the range regulators deem safe or acceptable, requiring no further regulations, particularly those likely to be expensive. They are similar to the risks of using home appliances (200 deaths per year in the United States) or of commercial aviation (103 deaths per year). Compared with dying at the hands of a terrorist, Americans are twice as likely to perish in a natural disaster and nearly a thousand times more likely to be killed in some type of accident. The same general conclusion holds when the full damage inflicted by terrorists — not only the loss of life but direct and indirect economic costs — is aggregated. As a hazard, terrorism, at least outside of war zones, does not inflict enough damage to justify substantially increasing expenditures to deal with it.” Indeed, while 9/11 was undoubtedly a terrible tragedy, so are thousands of other deaths throughout the country every year. Further, pre-9/11 terrorism was actually in a decline and even today terrorism has still not reached its all-time high.""[6] [7] ***Rc1: DefenseI refuted this above. Rc2: WARRMy opponent then uses semantics, but it does not matter as this does not help his case. As I mispelt the resolution, lets see if it makes sense using the actual definition of warr:Guitar company on terror[ism] That makes no sense, hence the semantics dont work. Also having a war over guitars means people die over nothing, hence the semantics is a red herring. CONCLUSIONMy opponent conceded a second time in his conclusion: ""War is bad"" Then made an ironic statement of: ""Freedom wins"". Now, the funny thing is I showed the war on terror ate freedom and stepped on our constitution, a docunment that protects our rights. So, really, here is my conclusion:- War on Terror is liberty eating- UNCONSTITUTIONAL- KILLS MORE PEOPLE THEN IT ""SAVES""- Terrorism is a false threat- You cant fight an ""ism"", it will therefore never end.For these reasons it it pretty clear who should win this debate, so far the answer is CON.

67	S3cb7f0d9-A164b37a0	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Pick your debate - 4/5 topics	"Thanks to you too Vi, this has indeed been a stimulating and thought provoking debate. ___________ I will summarise what I believe are the main points of this discussion before responding to my opponent's last post. Throughout this debate my opponent's position has been that the taking of an 'innocent' life (more specifically that of a non-combatant, and as further clarified by Pro in the last round ""non-combatants assumes that they have not taken another's life) can never be justified. It is this, rather than other aspects of terrorism that almost all of her arguments have been based on. This key argument is however undermined and contradicted by her implied justification of war. Vi has often stressed the differences between war and terrorism in this debate but in round 3 she did admit that wars can often involve terrorist acts (Shock and Awe, Hiroshima etc.) Vi has talked about the rules of engagement in war and referred to the Geneva Convention but her ideal image of a ""just war"" sadly does not exist. In both of the previous rounds I have pointed out that wars invariably lead to the loss of innocent lives and I have challenged Vi to give me an example of an exception to this rule or merely of any war that she believes was just. As no such example has been offered I think we can conclude that no war matches Pro's unrealistic restrictions for justification and that by proposing that wars can be just she is contradicting her own core argument against terrorism. I also pointed out early on in round two that terrorism does not necessarily include murder. The definition specifies violence only, not killing. Even if we were to accept Pro's assertion that killing someone who has not already killed is always wrong regardless of the benefits, an act of violence does not have to involve this to qualify as terrorism. _______________________ Pro: ""it means terrorizing people into submission by threatening (and taking) their lives."" As explained above, killing is not necessarily an aspect of terrorism. Pro: ""The ""War on Terrorism"" isn't the war against empty threats -- It's the war against real ones."" Aside from the fact that one can only wage war against a nation and not against an activity, the ""war on terrorism"" is essentially a euphemism for America's ideological conflict with Islamist politics. Like terrorism itself it is ideological and when tactics like shock and awe are employed it becomes more of a war OF terrorism. Pro: ""terrorism is enacted not on military soldiers but on average citizens (otherwise it would be considered war - not terrorism)."" This is not entirely accurate, under our definition almost any military strike that disregards the safety of non-combatants would qualify as terrorism, whether or not the civilians were the intended target, see my example of a terrorist strike on a military base in the last round. Pro: ""Con's example of militant lesbians raping a rapist is not applicable"" I wasn't trying to make a direct comparison between this and terrorism here, I was merely attempting to conceive of a situation where rape could potentially be justified. Pro: ""Con says that in order for my position to be true, that the resolution would have to read ""Terrorism can never be just"" or ""Terrorism is always unjust."" I really don't understand the point that he is trying to make, since that is indeed the position I am taking in this debate using the resolution that we have now: Terrorism can be justified. I am Con, so my position indicates that terrorism can never be justified and is always unjustified."" Just is an adjective, to justify is a verb. My point was that something does not have to be objectively and inherently just in order for a rational human being to justify it. The modified resolution is ""terrorism can never be justified"" and I am Con. Pro: ""in Con's example, Hitler had not yet killed anyone as he mentions Hitler's *intent* and not Hitler's actual deeds."" Careful reading will show that I specified this scenario taking place ""during the first months of World War II."" At this point Hitler was already responsible for the loss of many innocent lives. It is his deeds as well as his intent that would justify his assassination. Pro: ""the minute we begin to view outright murder as acceptable in any situation, we find ourself on a slippery slope as the word ""sometimes"" opens a panorama of moral doubt"" I am by no means an expert on the subject of logical fallacies but I believe that this ""slippery slope"" argument represents one. I don't think there is anything revolutionary or morally perplexing about the concept that many innocent lives should be valued higher than a few innocent lives. This is how civilian casualties in war are generally justified. Pro: ""But even if more unnecessary death occurs by not killing his family, who ever established utilitarianism as a moral principle? So far we have only distinguished rationality as the principle."" I think in this kind of situation, the logic behind valuing the many over the few is self-evident. Pro: ""Choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil. Murder is always wrong, thus simply because you may be save many lives by killing a few people, the act of killing is immoral within itself and therefore cannot be morally justified."" Yes killing may be immoral and no, two wrongs don't make a right. Retaliating out of revenge can not be morally justified but if an act (however unjust in itself) prevents far greater injustice then it can, on balance, be morally justified. Pro: ""Another argument in that regard is Kant's theory of deontological ethics"". To be brutally honest, I find the ramblings of Immanuel Kant pretty incomprehensible, though I couldn't say for sure whether the problem is with my own level of comprehension or with the theories themselves. Pro: ""If you are alone trapped and isolated inside of a room with 1 other person, but there is only enough food for 1 person to survive, it may be *necessary* to kill the other person to ensure your survival; however, that doesn't make killing itself just."" This would be a more fitting analogy for the topic in question if you had specified that the other person was armed and dangerous and you had every reason to believe that they were planning to kill you. Terrorism seldom occurs without some form of provocation. Pro: ""Indeed countless psychological studies show that humans have an innate resistance towards acting violently or killing other human beings if they are rational people"". It isn't clear that this is a moral resistance, it could be mere squeamishness. Imagine that the other person has severely wronged you and this resistance will wane. Pro: ""In the rest of Con's examples, killing innocent parties was always justified because they were going to become killers themselves in the FUTURE (such as the military trainees)."" This completely ignores the non-combatant military staff (catering etc.) I mentioned at the base as well as my other example of the men who provided the killer with his alibi. I don't know if my opponent missed these or if she just doesn't have an answer for them. Pro: ""It isn't until they have already killed could the killing of them be just, and therefore justified (thus not making it terrorism, but something else entirely)."" If there is so much as one non-combatant in the target zone then any act of war qualifies as terrorism under our definition. Pro: ""it would not be justified for me to take their life - such as the life of a politician who voted for war"" You don't have to take their life to terrorise them. Also I believe the man giving the order is at least as much to blame as the man pulling the trigger. Out of characters and rapidly running out of time.

67	S3cb7f0d9-A876d87a5	2	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Pick your debate - 4/5 topics	"I'd like to thank feverish again for this debate! --------------------------- Con begins by pointing out that terrorism indicates ""the struggle of people for determination, or revolution, or rebellion"" which is true. However, the focal point of the word terrorism is terror; it means terrorizing people into submission by threatening (and taking) their lives. If the threats were empty, then it wouldn't be terrorism - it would only be ""threats."" Terrorism implies that the threats are actually carried out. So, it makes sense to assume that terrorism implies taking innocent people's (civilians) lives. Again, if the threats of taking those lives were not carried out, then terrorism wouldn't work or even be terrorism at all. This need not turn into a debate over semantics; we can reason this through using examples from our every day lives. The ""War on Terrorism"" isn't the war against empty threats -- It's the war against real ones. That threat, of course, is taking lives or accomplishing goals that can only be accomplished via taking lives. --------------------------- Next we move onto the idea of ""justified"" terrorism. As I have pointed out, terrorism is enacted not on military soldiers but on average citizens (otherwise it would be considered war - not terrorism). As I have also pointed out, it is irrational to justify taking the life of an innocent human being. Con's example of militant lesbians raping a rapist is not applicable, since the justice can be found in the ""eye for an eye"" theory. However, the civilians that are being terrorized are not killers, therefore the equivalent ""punishment"" is not applicable to them and killing them is not justified. --------------------------- Con says that in order for my position to be true, that the resolution would have to read ""Terrorism can never be just"" or ""Terrorism is always unjust."" I really don't understand the point that he is trying to make, since that is indeed the position I am taking in this debate using the resolution that we have now: Terrorism can be justified. I am Con, so my position indicates that terrorism can never be justified and is always unjustified. Since I agree to that standard, I'm not really sure what Con's point is in this regard. I have argued that terrorism as we have been defining it (and in the way which I have explained is applicable - i.e. the taking of innocent lives) is indeed always unjust. --------------------------- Regarding rationality, Con says, ""I'm talking about the rare instances where a rational person can make a clear minded decision that an act of violence is likely to bring greater benefit and more long term peace and that the ultimate loss of innocent life will be less in the long term because of it."" He then proceeds to present the example of killing Hitler before Hitler had the opportunity to kill others. Now ignoring the obvious argumentum ad Hitlerum fallacy and the fact that Hitler waged war (which again is irrelevant to the debate), there are several problems with this analogy... aside from the fact that I don't know if that example even constitutes systematic terrorism as we know it. Nevertheless, in Con's example, Hitler had not yet killed anyone as he mentions Hitler's *intent* and not Hitler's actual deeds. That said, it is important to make the distinction between a moral and practical justification. Killing the innocent parties is indeed murder, and the minute we begin to view outright murder as acceptable in any situation, we find ourself on a slippery slope as the word ""sometimes"" opens a panorama of moral doubt: when is violence justified? How can we know? Who gets to make the decision? It is easier to distinguish specific situations than it is to draw lines that will allow us to make decisions reliably in the future. And what good are these lines, anyway, if they are not universally accepted?"" [1]. I hope we can universally accept that unnecessary death via the form of murder (or terrorism) is wrong. So in Con's example, if we kill Hitler - i.e. murder to his family - then their ""unnecessary"" death is the result. If we don't, then more people die -- there is even more ""unnecessary"" death. But even if more unnecessary death occurs by not killing his family, who ever established utilitarianism as a moral principle? So far we have only distinguished rationality as the principle. Choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil. Murder is always wrong, thus simply because you may be save many lives by killing a few people, the act of killing is immoral within itself and therefore cannot be morally justified. Another argument in that regard is Kant's theory of deontological ethics [2]. Kant explains that we have a duty to the individual and autonomy of the will. In other words, the lives of the individuals in Hitler's family are just as valuable as other lives, and they have a right to it until they forfeit that right - which they have not. --------------------------- We now move onto the idea of necessary vs. just. One might argue that while it isn't just to kill Hitler's family, that it might be necessary to save the lives of other people. However just because something is necessary does not mean that it's just (morally right). If it's not just, then how can it be justified when the definition of justified itself reads ""proven to be just?"" Think of it this way -- If you are alone trapped and isolated inside of a room with 1 other person, but there is only enough food for 1 person to survive, it may be *necessary* to kill the other person to ensure your survival; however, that doesn't make killing itself just. You may rationalize your action to assume that it was justified in order to further your own survival, but just because your greatest desire is to survive doesn't mean that killing is the rational thing to do. Sociologist Zygmunt Bauman's thesis presumes that morality has a biological origin, the 'animal pity' we feel when we see another human being suffering. The idea is that morality precedes civilization and functions independently of it, surviving like a weed in the cracks even when civilization does its best to extirpate it [3]. Indeed countless psychological studies show that humans have an innate resistance towards acting violently or killing other human beings if they are rational people; I think this much Con and I can agree on. --------------------------- In the rest of Con's examples, killing innocent parties was always justified because they were going to become killers themselves in the FUTURE (such as the military trainees). However there is no way to 100% guarantee that they would have actually killed. In a court of law, for instance, there is no liability in tort for consequences that cannot be foreseen (see: Palsgraf vs. Long Island Railroad). And since said parties are innocent until they are guilty, then in the end you're still taking an innocent's person life. It isn't until they have already killed could the killing of them be just, and therefore justified (thus not making it terrorism, but something else entirely). --------------------------- Con points out that terrorism deals with those who are ""non-combatants."" Agreed, though I think it's clear that non-combatants assumes that they have not taken another's life. As such, it would not be justified for me to take their life - such as the life of a politician who voted for war, or someone who gave a false alibi for the one who murdered my family (according to Con's example). --------------------------- Conscripted combatants are irrelevant to the debate; they are part of war - not terrorism. --------------------------- I'm out of characters, but I don't believe any more needs to be said and I have addressed all of Con's points : ) [1] http://www.spectacle.org...

67	Sc57b3338-Ad469aa3c	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	This House Believes that Terrorism can be Justified	I thank con for taking this debate. Terrorism: the unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Justified: having, done for, or marked by a good or legitimate reason. I also say that the terrorist attack would only be justified when fighting back against an oppressive government or regime. Let us look at the case of Nelson Mandela. The apartheid in South-Africa was cruel. The apartheid in South Africa was heartless. Nelson Mandela admitted to 156 acts of public violence at his trial, and organised many terrorist attacks on key government targets. This, by the definition given, is terrorism. But, as I said, I believe that terrorism is justified in certain situations. I am in no way saying that 9/11 should be commended, or that they were justified in any way for what they did. In the case of Mandela, the ends justify the means. They had tried a diplomatic approach. They had tried a non-violent approach but they were met with violence every time. In the end, the only way that they could actually gain the attention they deserved was through terrorism, which led to blacks and whites being able to discuss and challenge what atrocities were happening. Secondly, terrorism can always be justified by a certain group of people, as the justification of it is subjective. Again, I would never seek to say that 9/11 was good, and I would condemn it as quickly as the next person, but Al Qaeda would've sincerely thought that their actions were justified. As Gerald Seymour once said: 'One man's terrorist in another man's freedom fighter' To summarize this particular round: 1) Terrorism can be justified in certain situations when the end justifies the means 2) Terrorism can always be justified by certain groups, no matter what the situation entails	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	Sbfb67452-Aa9184fe3	0	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Islam is not a religion of terrorism	"RebuttalI. What is Jihad? My opponent said that according to the dictionary of Islam, a Jihad is ""a religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad."" This is not what in fact the dictionary of Islam says. This is what the dictionary of Islam, which my own opponent has put in his sources and which I mentioned in my arguments, says about Jihad: '(1) Personal Struggle (in the way of Allah (God) to keep evil away from yourself) (2) Holy War (Fighting a fair, defensive war - to stop oppression' [1]Note that Con does not give any link to this ""Dictionary of Islam"". It seems like its from a site ""Why I am not a Muslim"". Funny indeed, but the fact is that the dictionary of Islam does not say what Con claims, as I have shown. At my argument round, I explained what Jihad really is and that it does not have anything to do with terrorism. For the sake of the argument, I will explain it briefly again. The meaning of ""Jihad"" is ""effort"". Thus, in Islam, ""to carry out jihad"" is ""to show effort, to struggle"". Prophet Muhammad explained that ""the greatest jihad is the one a person carries out against his lower soul"". This means your desires and ambitions. The term Jihad is applied in many different forms. One of its forms is also war. But Allah permitted Jihad in war only for defensive porpuses. And Jihad does not mean ""Holy war"".Jihad does not have anything to do with terrorism, it simply just a self-defense. Jihad in Islam is striving in the way of God, by for example doing good deeds, propogate the message of Islam, making the hajj, and, if no other choice - with arms (using weapons in combat)II. What the Qur'an says about unbelievers I will respond to both of these verses, taking only with me their place in the Quran, because of limited space.3:149-151Answer: This verse does in no way promote terrorism. It does only say to not follow the disbelievers. Because the disbelievers make partners with God, terror will be cast into their hearts by God, and they will go to hell because of that. It does not say anything about killing the unbelievers or to promote terrorism.4:91Answer: As everybody clearly can see from this verse, the Muslims are ordered to kill them only if they do not offer peace or hold their hands. It does not say to kill them without a reason.The people being referred to by this verse are the pagan Arabs who had been waging war against prophet Muhammed and who had broken their covenant and treaties with him. And how does this verse promote terrorism? This verse is just talking about some pagans which the Muslims was in war with. Does not have anything with promoting terrorism. When it says to kill them wherever you find them, it is only meant for the those same pagan Arabs. Of course you will say to kill them wherever you find them. Every rational person would say that. Should they just look at them? Give them a hug maybe? In war, you have to kill them wherever you find them. Of course, only those who is active in the war.III. Why should we fight the unbelievers?My opponent says that 'the Qur'an says that we should fight unbelievers because of their beliefs'. This is not true at all. There is no complusion in islam. And nowhere in these verses that my opponent gave from the Quran does it say that we should fight the unbelievers because of their beliefs. The closest verse saying this is 9:29, but this verse is being misinterpreted a lot. Let me answer that verse and the other verses my opponent gave.9:28Answer: Yes, the idolatrous are unclean indeed, and because of the fact that they are idolatrous, they are of course not allowed to worship in the place of the Muslims. But what does that have to do with Islam promoting terrorism?9:29Answer: This verse does not say that you should fight the people of scripture because they do not believe in Allah or the last day, but that you should fight the people of scripture, until they pay the tribute. Thats all. Does not have anything with terrorism or killing the people of scripture themself because they don't believe in Allah or the last day. Why they have to pay the tribute is another topic which I dont have time to talk about. 9:30Answer: Again, what does the fact that just because the Christians and Jews are perverse in saying that God has a son, have to do with Islam promoting terrorism?IV. Kill the Apostates!First of all, this verse which you showed us from the Quran does not say that we should kill apostates. It does not have anything to do with apostates. Its also taken completely out of context. This verse speaks about the pagan Arabs. If you read the whole context, you will see that this verse is talking about those pagan Arabs which are not in a peace treaty with you and basically don't want any peace, but just fight. In this verse, Allah clearly says that you should make peace with them if they also want peace, but if they attack you and don't wanna have peace with you, then you have the right to fight them.Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi quotes the verses in their full context and then asks the following:'Now tell me honestly, do these verses give a free permission to kill any one anywhere? These verses were revealed by God to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), at the time when Muslims were attacked by the non-Muslims of Makkah on a regular basis. They were frightening the Muslim community of Madinah. One may say using the contemporary jargon that there were constant terrorist attacks on Madinah and in this situation Muslims were given permission to fight back the “terrorist”. These verses are not a permission for “terrorism” but they are a warning against the “terrorists.” But even in these warnings you can see how much restraint and care is emphasized.' [2]Now, let us say, just for the sake of the argument, that Islam teaches that apostates should be killed. Does that mean that Islam is a religion of terrorism? If so, my opponent has to show me how the killing of apostates proofs that Islam is a religion of terrorism. Basically, how does the promotion of Islam that apostates should be killed, proof that Islam also promotes terrorism?V. How the early Muslims interpreted all of thisFrom GuillaumeThis is not the whole saying. The saying goes on to say that Huwayyisa accepted Islam after this.If one was to believe that the above mentioned killing did happen because of the order of Prophet Muhammad and that command was completely unjust and absolutely unwarranted for (as my opponent wants us to believe), then could the person who had questioned the killer would have accepted Muhammed as the ""Messenger of God"" and become a Muslim? [3]Also, if you see the historical background behind these conflicts, you will see that the behaviors of the Jews was the root cause of the conflicts. The Jews of Medina, where this happened, used to ridicule Muslim women and tease them, mocked prophet Muhammed, and even converted to Islam just to destroy it, and at the same time living under the Muslims. It should also be noted that this is just talking about the Jews of Medina who was basically bad and tried to destroy Islam. Simple as that.The hadith narrated by AliThis hadith (A saying of prophet Muhammed) speaks about people who leaves Islam. Have nothing to do with promoting terrorism. Anyway, I have refuted this issue on apostaty above and so will not, and does not, need to refute it again. It should also be noted that this saying is talking about the last days. So we in our time, and probably in a very long time to come, does not need to think about this. This hadith is also clearly only speaking about 'some young foolish people'.Sources1. http://www.islamic-dictionary.com...2. http://islamnewsroom.com...3. http://www.mostmerciful.com...4. http://islamnewsroom.com..."

States who ignore the Geneva Conventions, for example by mistreating prisoners or deliberately attacking civilian targets, are guilty of terrorism and this cannot be justified. Nor are the Conventions only applicable to warfare between sovereign states - their principles can be clearly applied in other kinds of conflict and used to distinguish between legitimate military struggle and indefensible terrorism. Nor is it reasonable to argue that there are grey areas, and that civilians are sometimes legitimate targets - once such a claim has been made anything can eventually be 'justified' in the name of some cause. All too often the political leaderships of protest movements have decided that limited 'physical force' is necessary to advance their cause, only to find the violence spiralling out of control. The 'hard men' who are prepared to use force end up in control of the movement, which increasingly attracts criminals and others who love violence for its own sake. The original base of support for the movement in the wider population and internationally is alienated. The authorities against whom the movement is struggling also respond by using increasingly repressive measures of their own, generating a spiral of violence and cruelty.

In many countries terrorists have succeeded in bringing governments to negotiate with them and make concessions to them. Where governments have not been willing to concede to rational argument and peaceful protest, terrorism can compel recognition of a cause. Nelson Mandela moved from terrorist to President. In many other countries we see this trend too – in Israel, Northern Ireland, recently in Sri Lanka, and in the Oslo peace process that led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority.

67	S2f1d68cd-A43bdb66a	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism Can Be Justified	"Ok lets dive into this. Firstly, I would like to answers Pro's question, ""Which term definition do you find accurate and a reminder that this definition that you choose will be used the entire debate no matter what unless strong evidence counts the definition you choose as void."" I will use the definition of ""the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes."" http://dictionary.reference.com...... Now I will make my arguments, and intend to prove that Terrorism cannot be justified. Contention #1: Terrorism endangers and/or can harm, or even kill INNOCENT civilians. Acts of Terrorism Include: Bombing Hijacking Arson Kidnapping Assault Murder Theft Biological Attacks Sabotage So with all these, can you show me one, that doesn't pose a threat to civilians? Even more, innocent civilians. No, you can't. How is it possible for other humans to justify killing, harming, or endangering other humans, and even with some events that have occurred in the past, killing large amounts of people. I don't see how thats possible, even if the target of the attacks are/is someone who has done something bad to you. There has been 101 terrorist attacks this year. Yes, I am talking about 2014. 96/101 of these have involved at least one death. Proof that at least 90% of terrorist attacks involve a death, and so many more injured. Everyone knows that one of the golden rules we grew up with is ""Do unto others, as you would have them do to you"". In my personal opinion, this a good thing to live by, and most people would agree with me. It's not ""Do unto others, what they have done to you"" For a very good reason, it's is not that, do unto others as you would have them do to you is a philosophy to keep peace in our world. It means that even if someone has done something bad to you, still treat them the way you want to be treated (don't do any bad to them back) Contention #2: Inflicting harm on people is not a healthy or good way to get rid of your feelings. This pretty much speaks for it self, but I will elaborate. If you are mad, talk to someone, complain, get help. Don't kill people to show where you stand, because the people you are killing have nothing to do with you not being happy or getting your way. September 11, 2001: 4 planes are Hijacked, crashed. 2996 people were killed, 6000+ injured, including innocent babies, kids, and adults. April 13, 2013: 2 pressure cooker bombs are planted at the Boston Marathon, killing 3 spectators and injuring 264 others. There are so many, as said above I could state 101 examples, just from this year, but I don't have the time for that. These are to fair way to deal with your anger. It's not healthy, and it sure won't make people listen to your message/wanting/or to what you have to say. ---Conclusion--- Terrorism is not fair. It is especially cannot be justified. Killing people, Harming people, Endangering people cannot be justified. If you are mad, and/or want people to listen to what you have to say. Don't kill people. Get help. I think the best rule to live by is: ""Do unto others, as you would have them do to you"" Source(s) 1: http://en.wikipedia.org... 2: http://en.wikipedia.org... 3: http://en.wikipedia.org..."

67	S160b94ce-A898d40d9	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism can be justified	"Just War Theory.Con's counter that civilians conceptually can never present a threat is wrong as presented in my points regarding tax support and civic representation. Not only do civilians finance their governments wars (thus being at least partially responsible for the acts committed in them) but in many cases the will of citizens is embodied in the policies of their government, especially in the case of modern liberal democracies. I will respond to Con's counters against these arguments specifically below. Also, Con's point regarding the invoking terror as a method to pursue war is moot in this debate as terrorism was defined strictly as civilian attack. While many terrorists have that motivation in mind, it's irrelevant in the scope of this debate.On Con's slippery slope counter, the argument can only be made by failing to recognize the reasoning I have made in favor of terrorism being permissible. Terrorism is permissible only because civilians are in many cases partially responsible for the acts of their government. This means terrorism is justified as a means to defend against the actions of a specific government. For instance, if the U.S. is engaging in an unjust war (by JWT standards) against some country then terrorism may be justified in defense against those actions. But it's clearly incoherent for a State to use violent force in an effort to defend itself against itself since it is the civilian's relation to a government's policies that make them legitimate targets. I have no idea how my opponent conceives of the logic being the same in these two cases.Contention. Civilians and Responsibility.(A) Taxes.The main counter to the financial support contention is that no civilian ever directly threatens life in war, thus they never forfeit their right to life which if why soldiers are able to be killed justly. The problem with this point though is that Con fails to justify any categorical or conceptual difference between a citizen financing the killing actions of a soldier and someone financing the actions of a hit man. Sure the exact details might be different, but in both cases we still have someone paying someone else to go out and kill. Just like we would hold both the hit man and his employer responsible for such acts, so should the civilian who finances war be held responsible along with the soldier who carries it out. Con's point that targeting non-combatants is never necessary is unsubstantiated since he never provides argumentative support. One can certainly conceive of a situation where attacking civilians who finance a war causes financing of that war to drop, plus there is no a priori reason to suggest killing civilians could never be necessary in war. At this point it is only an assertion by Con and should not be accepted without evidential or logical reasoning.(B) Civic Representation-Non necessity of representing the people's willI can certainly agree with my opponent that not all policies acted out by a government will represent the will of it's people and that this applies just as much to war. However, it was never my contention that it did. The only point argued was that in many instances the government does represent the will of at least some of it's people who are not themselves members of the military or who are the ones fighting the war. Therefore where war is an enactment of general will (or really the will of any civilians who actively attempt to enact it) there is justification for acting against the people who's will specifically it represents. -War and representing minority viewsThe next point Con makes in counter is similar though distinct from the previous regarding civic representation. Con argues that in many cases there is not even a majority opinion needed to enact a given policy. He points out that in liberal democracies we see things like 40 o 30% support being sufficient to enact a policy even with substantial and majority opposition. From this Con posits that there's no reason to hold the ""citizenry as a whole"" responsible. But that was also never my case. It is only those who's will is being represented and who actively supported such a thing (by voting, persuading, giving public support to, etc.) that are morally responsible for the war. Just like a tax dissenter is not responsible for financing war, neither is a dissenter responsible for the views of others. My case only posits that (A) some civilians are justified targets of terrorism and (B) that those civilians are ones that either lend financial assistance to the war or who are part of the general will which the government seeks to represent in waging the war."

67	S2406689f-Ae7af1a38	1	1	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism is Sometimes Justified	"Ok, well justifying killing works too... lol. But your justification of killing is still flawed because it is based upon a presumed end. You stated that the terrorists kill important targets in accomplishing their mission, but there is no way to insure that such an action would without doubt provide absolute and unconditional victory. For instance, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated (killed) by a terrorist suicide bomb. She was definitely a political target and opposition to some, but that doesn't mean that her death guaranteed the idealogical goal of the terrorist. That scenario is still being played out. It is easy to look back and say ""Yes, they were justified because they won..."" but it is not the same when dealing with a value debate that occurs in the very present. But even looking into the past you cannot justify based upon the now-known end because at the time of the action (terrorism) the end was still undefined. Therefore, your argument that the means of killing is justified by the end result falls because the end result is never certain no matter how good the odds. Which brings forth your next argument that terrorism was the last resort and final option: How do you ever know if you run out of options? I'm obviously not as well versed on the certain incident that you continue to refer to, but I do know that there have been times when rescue came from outside the persecuted, many times. First example: United States Abolitionist Movement All seemed lost for the slaves and they were beginning to give up fighting the ""white man"", but then some free Americans began helping the slaves and even offered safe houses on the underground railroad. To the slaves, it seemed violence was the last option, but they gained help from the outside, thus proving that the ""last resort"" can never really be last because there is always a future. Second example: Abolitionist movement in Britain Slavery was abolished in Britain without a Civil War like the US had and was achieved through the efforts of a single free white man. Again, I'm not using the examples as exact references, but they explain the point that the same uncertainty applies to the amount of options a group has. ""Many of these revised tactics led to sniping operations, bombings of economic interests, and assassinations of political figures. Can this be justified? Yes. It is justified in that they are fighting a war of freedom. It is no different than any peoples fighting injustice and having to resort to extreme measures to wage that fight. The people dying are those who stand in the way of the achievement of the given goals."" ^I will show why the above is unjustifiable in the way stated. You relate the intent of the means as freedom.... Just. You relate the means to killings/bombings....Unjust. You relate the end to the achievement of the goal...Undefined. Furthermore: ""The people dying are those who stand in the way of the achievement of the given goals."" ^ The achievement of the given goals is not guaranteed. Hitler's campaign killed people in order to produce a perfect world of Aryan Descent. In his view, the end justified the means, but he is commonly considered a ""crazed killer"" because his end failed. If his end had been achieved do you think that anyone would second guess the means? Of course not because they would have gotten what they wanted. This, however, would be looking back after the end was achieved, not whilst it was still undefined. So, after all of the above it comes down to two things: 1. You cannot justify the means with and undefined end as all ends are undefined. 2.

67	Sbfb67433-A18832d7c	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Islam is not a religion of terrorism	"Refuting my opponents argumentsI. What is Jihad? My opponent said that according to the dictionary of Islam, a Jihad is ""a religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad."" This is not what in fact the dictionary of Islam says. This is what the dictionary of Islam, which my own opponent has put in his sources, says about Jihad: '(1) Personal Struggle (in the way of Allah (God) to keep evil away from yourself) (2) Holy War (Fighting a fair, defensive war - to stop oppression' [1]This is exactly what Jihad is. Its a big misunderstanding on Jihad going on. The biggest misunderstanding on it, is that its meaning is ""Holy war"". This is completely wrong. You will not find in any place the word ""Holy war"" in the Quran, which means ""harbun muqaddasatu"" in arabic. The exact meaning of ""Jihad"" is ""effort"". Thus, in Islam, ""to carry out jihad"" is ""to show effort, to struggle"". Prophet Muhammad explained that ""the greatest jihad is the one a person carries out against his lower soul"". This means your desires and ambitions. The term Jihad is applied in many different forms. Jihad exist also on a war form. But Allah granted permission for Jihad in war only for defensive purposes.II. What the Qur'an says about unbelievers I will respond to both of these verses, taking only with me their place in the Quran, because of limited space.3:149-151Answer: This verse does in no way promote terrorism. It does only say to not follow the disbelievers. Because the disbelievers make partners with God, terror will be cast into their hearts by God, and they will go to hell because of that. It does not say anything about killing the unbelievers or to promote terrorism.4:91Answer: As everybody clearly can see from this verse, the Muslims are ordered to kill them only if they do not offer peace or hold their hands. It does not say to kill them without a reason.The people being referred to by this verse are the pagan Arabs who had been waging war against prophet Muhammed and who had broken their covenant and treaties with him. And how does this verse promote terrorism? This verse is just talking about some pagans which the Muslims was in war with. Does not have anything with promoting terrorism. When it says to kill them wherever you find them, it is only meant for the those same pagan Arabs. Of course you will say to kill them wherever you find them. Every rational person would say that. Should they just look at them? Give them a hug maybe? In war, you have to kill them wherever you find them. Of course, only those who is active in the war.III. Why should we fight the unbelievers?My opponent says that 'the Qur'an says that we should fight unbelievers because of their beliefs'. This is not true at all. There is no complusion in islam. And nowhere in these verses that my opponent gave from the Quran does it say that we should fight the unbelievers because of their beliefs. The closest verse saying this is 9:29, but this verse is being misinterpreted a lot. Let me answer that verse and the other verses my opponent gave.9:28Answer: Yes, the idolatrous are unclean indeed, and because of the fact that they are idolatrous, they are of course not allowed to worship in the place of the Muslims. But what does that have to do with Islam promoting terrorism?9:29Answer: This verse does not say that you should fight the people of scripture because they do not believe in Allah or the last day, but that you should fight the people of scripture, until they pay the tribute. Thats all. Does not have anything with terrorism or killing the people of scripture themself because they don't believe in Allah or the last day. Why they have to pay the tribute is another topic which I dont have time to talk about. 9:30Answer: Again, what does the fact that just because the Christians and Jews are perverse in saying that God has a son, have to do with Islam promoting terrorism?IV. Kill the Apostates!First of all, this verse which you showed us from the Quran does not say that we should kill apostates. It does not have anything to do with apostates. Its also taken completely out of context. This verse speaks about the pagan Arabs. If you read the whole context, you will see that this verse is talking about those pagan Arabs which are not in a peace treaty with you and basically don't want any peace, but just fight. In this verse, Allah clearly says that you should make peace with them if they also want peace, but if they attack you and don't wanna have peace with you, then you have the right to fight themNow, let us say, just for the sake of the argument, that Islam teaches that apostates should be killed. Does that mean that Islam is a religion of terrorism? If so, my opponent has to show me how the killing of apostates proofs that Islam is a religion of terrorism. Basically, how does the promotion of Islam that apostates should be killed, proof that Islam also promotes terrorism?V. How the early Muslims interpreted all of thisFrom GuillaumeThis is not the whole saying. The saying goes on to say that Huwayyisa accepted Islam after this. Because of limited space, I cannot give the whole saying. Its on Guillaume at page 369. If one was to believe that the above mentioned killing did happen because of the order of Prophet Muhammad and that command was completely unjust and absolutely unwarranted for (as my opponent wants us to believe), then could the person who had questioned the killer would have accepted Muhammed as the ""Messenger of God"" and become a Muslim?The hadith narrated by AliThis hadith (A saying of prophet Muhammed) speaks about people who leaves Islam. In other words: Apostaty. Have nothing to do with promoting terrorism. Anyway, I have refuted this issue on apostaty above and so will not, and does not, need to do it again.Sources1. http://www.islamic-dictionary.com...2. http://www.aboutjihad.com...3. http://www.mostmerciful.com...4. http://quran.com..."

67	S830ab76-A45adcbe2	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Resolved: The United States should fight the war on terror until Al-Qaeda is eliminated.	"Dear Sir: Thank you for beginning this debate. This is also my first time on this website, and I'm looking forward to hearing your arguments. I will show that the Negative should win because it is impossible for the Affirmative to meet the terms of its own resolution. Terrorism, by Osama bin Laden or any other figures, in Afghanistan, India, or anywhere else, cannot be eradicated through warfare. The United States' war on terror is an unwinnable war. This is because a) the inherent nature of terrorism and b) the specific geopolitical context in which the war on terror must operate. A)Contention A: Terrorism, generally defined as attacks on civilians to inspire fear in governments or communities, cannot be defeated in a military war both practically speaking and ideologically. a.Subpoint A: From a purely practical perspective, the US can't get rid of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan because Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations use asymmetrical warfare. I.e., since they wouldn't stand a chance directly against US infantry or tanks and it don't have the manpower or multibillion dollar war machine of the US, they strike in unexpected ways. There's no bases, no boundaries to fight, Al Qaeda members live in everyday communities. Tactically, routing out terrorists essentially requires bulldozing entire cities (resulting in extreme civilian casualties, which I will come back to.) Terrorist structures, including Al Qaeda, are generally decentralized, so removing one person like Osama bin Laden doesn't achieve the Affirmative's purpose. b.Subpoint B: This brings me to my second point: Terrorism cannot be defeated via warfare because it is ideologically motivated by victimhood, therefore it is perpetuated by the violence of a dominant world-power like the United States. Terrorism thrives on the narrative of imperial powers (historically the West) coming into to other countries (historically non-white, non-English speaking countries) and taking over. The United States is doing exactly that. Millions of people have been displaced, injured, and killed over the course of the war, most of them civilians. Hospitals, schools, homes, national treasures and cultural artifacts have been destroyed without a thought. The war on Afghanistan has been the single most effective recruitment tool for Al Qaeda in the last thirty years. This is known as the ""blowback"" effect by the CIA. The more violence and destruction for which the United States is responsible, the more terrorism will result. B)Contention B: Along those lines, the United States will not win the war on terror in Afghanistan or defeat Al Qaeda because it will never have popular support, in Afghanistan or from the rest of the Middle East. It's common knowledge that the United States funneled money into weapons and training for the mujahedeen in the 1970s so they could eject the Soviets. When the Soviets pulled out, the United States left a war-torn country with more guns than schools and an extreme political power vacuum eventually filled by the Taliban and reactionary religious groups. It hasn't escaped their notice that the United States could have cared less about the Afghan population, and this is the key to the United States' unpopularity in the region and around the world: our hypocrisy. We support dictatorships when it's convenient for us, and wrap ourselves in the rhetoric of freedom when we want to take out governments (often democratically elected: Chile, Iran, Haiti… etc etc) that aren't advancing our interests. In the Middle East, we support governments that imprison and abuse their own people in Saudia Arabia, Pakistan, and India, which hardly lends credibility to our case. Most importantly, the United States supports Israel's occupation of Palestine. The details of which are the topic for another debate, but it's undeniable that huge portions of the Arabic-speaking and Muslim worlds view this in a negative light. Reactionary Islamist movements are fueled by the United States' heavy handed, unilateral interventions around the world. In summary, the Affirmative cannot meet the terms of its own case, because in your terms there is no way to ""keep fighting until we get rid of these people."" It's impossible, and to continue to pursue it means more and more loss of innocent life and deserved badwill towards the United States. How do we win against Al-Qaeda? Fierce, unrelenting, even when it's difficult consistency in the pursuit of justice. Spending a fraction of what we spend on cluster bombs on economic development, public education, healthcare in the United States or abroad. Supporting the non-profits and other civil society groups that argue for freedom of speech and women's rights in Afghanistan with funding and protection. Calling out our allies when they violate human rights. I urge a Negative vote. If we want to live in a fairer, safer world, we need to start by ending the violence and destruction in Afghanistan that comes back and harms more innocent people through terrorism. Thank you."

Peaceful and democratic means must always be used. Even when democratic rights are denied, non-violent protest is the only moral action.

For the final round let's make a sort of summary and an ending conclusion...There's no justification to violate human rights. Ignoring human rights is like taking away humanity from people, but leaving your own humanity at the same time. Rights are part of the human nature, ignoring them is ignoring humanness. There's always a peacefully way. There are plenty of historical examples that show this, you can have a revolution peacefully.Violating the rights of others in order to defend your own rights is illogical end selfish. The old rule of thumb: do to others whatever you would like them to do to you.Every definition of terrorism denotes the same problems I pointed out. Terrorism brings only bad attention. Terrorism creates hate and a desire for revenge within the population. People see terrorist as killers and bastards and ignore their cause.Thanks for this debate.

67	S509aeb2a-A58f9e05a	0	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Mercy vs. Strict Justice	== Overview == The Justice system is an example of strict justice since it punishes criminals for offenses that they commit. Therefore, the justice system can be used as an example and argument for my case. Whilst, my opponent may believe that quantity supercedes quality however this is not a correct assumption. Despite the fact that, I am not covering many other issues not regarding punishment and criminals this is not a reason to vote against me. Criminal offense is a major point that actually covers the strongest point for my case. R1 - Justice as a Principle (1) Family was just an example and I wasn’t talking about family regarding crime. Personally, and I am sure that many people agree with me, when they say that they prefer their family to strangers. This is subjective however it is normal. Crime is a more serious issue (which I am sure that my opponent agrees with) than viewing your family subjectively (not in regards to crime). It is not contradictory. What I thought was implied was not understood by my opponent. What I meant by my argument was that family doesn’t have any major consequences regarding viewing them subjectively. Viewing criminals subjectively will have major consequences (as explained in my arguments). (2) The example that my opponent provided is very different to what my argument actually said. In response to me saying that subjectivity is undesirable, my opponent provides an example regarding the law. I never said that subjectivity should be against the law. If it were to be against the law then of course there would be undesirable consequences however I just said that it is unreasonable to view court cases subjectively (on purpose) and to promote it. R2 - Justice in Application (1) a) This actually has no relevance to what I said. I said that harsher crimes deter crime. My opponent has told me that the prison population has increased however this has no relevance to my argument. My argument specifically spoke about harsher sentencing. Showing the amount of criminals just tells me that there is more crime and this is another reason to increase sentences. It doesn’t show a clear correlation between harsher prison sentences and fear. There are many other factors and this argument doesn’t even mention harsher sentences. Just the amount of prisoners. b) Gun crimes does not cover all crimes and that is one very specific area. This is not a debate that is specific to any country or state and in terms of proportion to the world this is a pretty small area. Due to the fact that this is the only area that we can observe that has had these results there is no evidence that this isn’t a result to many other factors. Here we can observe the other possible factors: employment rate and gun control laws. Since this one area we cannot observe whether or not this will be the same for the majority. c) Firstly, that hasn’t really refuted my case. Even if the effect is only minimal (which is still preferable to mercy), my actual point was showing that mercy wouldn’t be as effective however since there has been a misunderstanding I will refute my opponent’s case. Firstly, I will repeat this again. My opponent agrees that it does prevent crime to some extent. Secondly, this is not specific to everywhere. (2) a) Well, if they are given a long sentence then they have clearly done something wrong. If they have done something wrong then they already know how to commit crimes. Also, extreme violence and murder can result in the execution of the criminal and sometimes life sentence this means that they will not be released until the end of their lives or an extremely long period of time. As a result, this means that they will not be able to commit crimes for a long period of time. Since my opponent has provided no source for this statement I assume that there is no statistical evidence to suggest that long prison sentences actually does increase crime. b) People that have broken the law don’t deserve to have jobs. This was covered in my previous rounds although I will expand upon it. We cannot allow criminals to be part of jobs just to boost the economy. Criminals are a threat to society and since they have committed crimes worthy of a criminal record it is good that they should get a criminal record. I have already given the example of it being unrealistic to give a murderer the job of a teacher so I will provide a more suitable example. Would you allow ‘anyone’ that has committed a crime worthy of sentencing to jail the job of being a lawyer in court or the judge? The answer should be no and I will be happy to debate you separately if you believe that the answer is yes for you (although I find this unlikely). (3) This argument seems to be putting money over lives. My opponent claims that prisons are taking too much money and too much space however is my opponent claiming that we shouldn’t have prisons and should allow murderers and rapists to freely walk around the street? I hope that this is not what they are suggesting. Yes, the government should set the management of money as a high priority but they should not prioritize this over the lives and safety of the public. My opponent has misunderstood my rehabilitation argument that I provided. I said that they should receive all of this whilst they are in prison therefore it is part of the reason as to why they should be arrested and imprisoned if they are found guilty. Rehabilitation alone is pointless since it does not work immediately and often takes several weeks to even begin having an effect. If you keep prisoners out of jail and solely rely on rehabilitation. Rehabilitation was not an argument on its own it was a sub-part of a whole argument. I agree that rehabilitation is an argument pro-mercy however that was not the case in my argument. When I said that the victim / society is allowed to inflict harm upon the felon I never stated the equivalent amount of harm and I never stated that it was necessarily physical harm. Harm can be defined as: “use (something) to bad effect or for a bad purpose” this does not necessarily imply physical harm. It can even mean prison - which is what I was referring to in this case. My opponent seems to be relying on one example of millions of major crimes that have been committed. What does this tell us about the strength of other examples? The fact cannot be completely dismissed since it is still true in that certain area. The same logical principle applies to your own arguments (as I stated before) you have kept arguments specific to certain areas / states and therefore you cannot completely dismiss my arguments unless you accept the dismissal of your own arguments made by me. R3 - What is mercy? I never contested with the fact that mercy does not have any kind of justice. I specifically said that it is arbitrary, meaning that people will be sympathetic to some people over others. It also opens up the possibility to discrimination and racism in particular since there is no clear margin between right and wrong when acting mercifully in court. A 12 year old child is much more likely to get away with murder in a system of mercy than a 40 year old man. R4 - Miscellaneous I can’t really make a rebuttal on this because my opponent has labeled miscellaneous as a heading and hasn’t referred to anything here other than my sources not being labelled. Conclusion This is just a summary of what has happened in this round because I feel like there is something that I need to mention here. Whilst I have responded to all of my opponent’s claims and clearly labelled each heading and responded to each one. My opponent has failed to properly respond to my framework or provide an alternative one and this is problematic for my opponent since at the moment under my framwork strict justice is preferable to mercy.

67	S3cb7f0d9-A2b907fc9	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Pick your debate - 4/5 topics	"Just a few comments before going on to my opponent's premises: ""Occasionally it can even be the most practical and reasonable way to achieve such ends."" What I'll be proving in this debate is that it is never just, or moral (reasonable) to achieve one's goals through terrorism. ""Terrorism can include these things but it no more implies or necessarily includes any of them than it does the struggle for rebellion."" As we can see, the definition of terrorism directly contradicts this. Terrorism either directly puts innocent people in harms way or disregards their safety completely. ""Viewed in isolation any such act is indeed unjust but in certain circumstances the killing of innocents is often justified on the premise that it will prevent a greater evil. My opponent's subsequent arguments regarding war all seem to disregard the clear fact that wars always end up killing 'innocent' people."" That doesn't matter. Killing of innocent people is never just. Taking an innocent life is always immoral and unjust, no matter the circumstances. One may say it is for the greater good - and yes, greater good may come from it, but it does not negate the immoral and unequal treatment of that life taken. ""I personally find it hard to disagree with this statement but the fact is that we often justify our unethical actions. If there was no question of an act being unethical then there would be no point attempting to justify it."" This is a very naive statement in which my opponent assumes that if someone can irrationally talk themselves into justifying immoral behavior, it must be ok. I can talk myself into believing that dragons exist, but real evidence points to the contrary. ""Wars kill civilians almost without exception and I would love to see a source detailing a war in which voluntary combatants were the only people harmed."" My opponent makes the assumption that I believe that killing civilians during war time is just and moral. Killing of civilians should not happen (in Just War theory), and if it does, it is always an immoral act (and yes, I would go as far as to call it terrorism if the targets were deliberately targeted or disregarded). ""None of this however alters the fact that many conventionally justified military actions fall under the definition of terrorism my opponent has provided"" Again, my opponent assumes that I don't believe that actions that target or disregard citizens in times of war are terrorist acts. It doesn't matter which wars I believe were just or not, it only matters that if two warring factions were to disregard the safety of non-combatants in any way, their acts directly infringe on the Geneva convention. ""That is precisely what happens in the majority of wars, which my opponent apparently thinks are justified. As I think I mentioned before, people usually justify these kinds of seemingly unethical actions by appealing to the concept of 'the greater good'."" I believe that intents of some wars are justifiable, but if in the process they infringe on the right to life of innocent people in a terrorist fashion, that they officially step into immoral territory - no matter what the greater good may be. ------------------------------ My opponent's arguments ""Firstly to show that something can be justified, I don't really need to show that something is objectively just, or believe it to be just myself, merely that it could potentially be interpreted as just by a rational mind."" For something to be justified, it must be objectively just - it can not be only ""interpreted"" as just by a mind. Minds reason through things irrationally all of the time. It would not be immoral to rape an innocent woman if we threw the term ""justified"" as a subjective term that the perpetrator can use in any way he pleases to call his action ""just."" Also, you do not need to be clinically ""insane"" in order to commit an immoral and unjust act. -------------------------------- ""War = Terrorism"" Just because the intent and initiation of a war is just, does not mean that specific acts in the war can not be considered terrorist acts. All of the ones my opponent has listed can be considered terrorist, immoral acts by the parties initiating. And again, just because people can assume that infringing on an innocent person's right to life can be justified, does not mean it can be. Slaughtering of innocent people, taking their lives which are not yours too take, is always immoral and unjust. -------------------------------- ""Terrorism = Justified"" 1. IRA Again, just because freedom fighters may view their acts as just because they are being oppressed, it does not make the act of killing innocent people just or moral. 2. ANC Again, just because the struggle of freedom fighters is a just act, their attacks should have solely been on their oppressors and not aimed at innocent people who are not volunteering their lives for the struggle or have taken any part in the oppressing. If they have, then they are not innocent and it is not terrorism. Also, it would seem that people like Nelson Mandela could have justifiable cause for their struggle, but never justifiable cause to kill innocent people. He seems to not be infallible with his morals anyway as he has been criticized for support of the immoral blood diamond trade. ------------------------------------- --Murder and disregard of an innocent human being's life is never justifiable.-- Terror is not a moral response to terror and killing innocent people is not a moral response to the deaths of innocent people. For a just war to occur, one must respond to an immoral act committed on one by another nation or group of people, but if one engages in such a war by also committing immoral atrocities, their justification has been negated. Killing of volunteered combatants is not committing an immoral act, for you are engaging in self defense and volunteering your life (as they have done theirs) for war time activities that lead to death. The life of another human being should never be used as a means to an end. Justice asks of the punishment of a crime to suit or be proportional in severity to the crime. An innocent person has not committed a crime, and thus the taking and disregarding of their life is a direct infringement of Justice. No one can make the claim that your life is their property to take for the gains of other people. Life must be voluntarily given. -------------------------------------------- I await my opponent's next round with excitement :) Regards, Vi"	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified
67	S160b94ce-Aee4a2ea7	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism can be justified	"Regarding Just War Theory and the framework for this debate, I obviously understand that orthodox JWT condemns terrorism which is why I added the condition that it will be used as a general standard ""unless a compelling reason is provided supporting why some aspect of it may be bypassed."" So Con's point regarding the definitional issues with my case is moot. On his conditions allegedly necessary to override orthodox JWT, his conditions are not actually all necessary. All I have to show is that the combatant/ non-combatant distinction in regards to civilians does not always have a legitimate moral basis in JWT. If I can show this then terrorism can be shown to be sometimes justified (at least not definitionally unjustified).Just War Theory.The distinction which Con has made between combatants and non-combatants is insufficient in relation to JWT. While it can't be denied that these differences do exist, Con hasn't shown why they are morally relevant according to JWT. In fact, JWT shows that they are not relevant. The rules of jun ad bellum and just in bello never argue for the combatant- non combatant distinction on the basis which my opponent has. The distinction is made because it is conceived of that civilians do not contribute to war or had no role in starting it. However, as I have shown, civilians are capable of (and often do) contribute to war via taxation and at some points may have a role in starting it through either voting in candidates on war platforms or through having their general will represented by the State in doing so.Contention. Civilians and Responsibility.(A) TaxesNote that Con has conceded the partial responsibility of citizens who fit my two conditions, yet he denies this as a forfeiture of the right to life. He writes: ""True, a citizen who finances a hit man is held partially responsible for acts committed by the hit man, but partial responsibility does not justify killing the citizen."" On the contrary, moral responsibility has been properly shown. This along with the concept of necessity in facing an existential threat (wherein military means are untenable) makes terrorism justified. While not being justified in every conceivable case, terrorism may be justified in some cases.On a situation being conceived where terrorism could be necessary to achieve some political goal, Con has argues that there is no possible scenario which could ever possibly occur. When I denied this, Con asked for an examples. I did not realize an example was needed though, seeing as there is no conceptual impossibility in the aforementioned scenario, thus it is clearly possible. However, since approaching the issue from this level has apparently been rejected by Con in favor of a simple made up scenario, I will oblige. Consider a situation where a large nation is attacking a smaller one. The large nation is so well equipped and the smaller one so ill-equipped that conventional warfare is almost impossible. This war is financed by taxation by the citizenry, the citizenry is wholly supportive of the war, and the State only acts to represent its citizens general will. Therefore attempting to lower the level of support for the war, and thus possibly end the current military campaign would be a necessary course of action in the face of an existential threat. Obviously everything in this scenario is possible, thus the situation itself is possible. (Note that this is not a new argument but a line of support requested by my opponent)(B) Civic RepresentationCon's rebuttal to my argument (like his previous rebuttal) only serves to argue that citizens do not necessarily support war through taxation or civic representation. He argues that ""not all citizens who pay taxes support war"". Well obviously and I never argues against this. The point though is that there are some citizens who do do so and thus those citizens are not morally innocent in regards to JWT. The Con is charged with defending the definitional innocence of all citizens. Simply arguing that not ALL of them conform to my definition of moral culpability does not serve to defend the definitional innocence as there clearly are some members of the citizenry who do conform to my definition. Furthermore, I never defended basing moral culpability on only taxes. Both support for war and financial support are necessary, not just one or the other and I never argued just one was sufficient.The next contention by Con is that my reason for moral culpability is instead some assault on freedom of speech of expression. He argues that ""if we are allowed to kill non-combatants because they voice their opinions publicly, then we have effectively negated the freedom of speech as a democratic ideal"". This is far from the actual argument I am making and is a gross misrepresentation of it. Moral responsibility does not stem from the mere voicing of opinions, it stems from the fact that in many cases in a liberal democracy, the will of the people is represented in the actions of the State. My opponent has not refuted this. It's not that these citizens express their opinion. Taking an example, by my standard someone who just says that the State should exterminate the Jews is not morally responsible for anything since the State has not actually carried out their ideal. However, if the State were to begin an extermination plan based off of the will of that person and other anti-Semites, then him and those who supported such a policy would be partially responsible. Note that this condition only applies when one's will is actually being represented and has a causal link e.g. the State is basing its actions off of citizen opinion. If a citizens opinion just randomly conforms to the will of a State who doesn't take citizen opinion into account, then that citizen would have no moral responsibility in the matter. It is only when this support has a causal relation to State actions that the citizen becomes partially responsible and my opponent has not actually responded to this argument.===Conclusion===Throughout this debate, Con placed a lot of emphasis on JWTs definition, claiming that the existence of the combatant/ non combatant distinction negated the resolutoin in itself, irrespective of the condition I provided in my R1 regarding the standard of value for this debate. Furthermore, since Con is defending the impossibility of terrorism being justified, the possible case which I provided serves to refute his position in itself. On top of that, Con never tried to refute my point regarding the will of the people and moral culpability (merely misrepresenting it as attack on freedom of speech). I also showed necessity as holding relevance in the case of military means being out of the question. This combined with the fact that non-military targets may hold moral responsibility also justifies the use of terrorism. Terrorism has been shown to be justified in some cases, with citizens not being definitionally innocent. Vote Pro."	PRO	terrorism justified	terrorism justified

67	Sab66897e-Acf637d29	2	2	Can terrorism be justified?	Terrorism can be justified.	Thank you for accepting, let us have a good debate.Terrorism is usually used as a means of expressing ones political cause, in extreme cases, where Democratic and peaceful methods have been exhausted, it is legitimate and justified to resort to terrorism. In a country with an oppressive state, causing suffering for the country's people and with no obvious possibility of international assistance, it is sometimes necessary to resort to violence to defend the people of one's country.It is the right of every individual or group, even if a minority, to express discontent. The state, as a representative of the people, should facilitate this possibility. furthermore, the state should support the rights of minorities, in order to prevent the will of the majority suppressing the rights of other people with different interests. If this does not happen, the state has failed its purpose and have lost its legitimacy. This, in combination with the growing inequalities and injustices amongst certain groups, justifies committing acts of terror in order to defend these rights, that were denied in the first place.For instance, Umkhonto we Sizwe, a liberation organization associated with the African National Congress in South Africa and led by Nelson Mandela, decided in 1961 to turn to violence in order to achieve liberation and the abolishment of Apartheid. The reason they gave was: “The time comes in the life of any nation when there remain only two choices: submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. (...) Refusal to resort to force has been interpreted by the government as an invitation to use armed force against the people without any fear of reprisals. The methods of Umkhonto we Sizwe mark a break with that past.”[1]The definition of terrorism depends very much on the person confronted with it's view upon it - the proposition does not need to defend every atrocity against innocent civilians to argue that terrorism is sometimes justified.A broad definition of terrorism would say, that the use of violence for political ends by any group which breaks the Geneva Conventions (which govern actions between armies in wartime) or ignores generally accepted human rights. Under this definition, any state and their armed forces could be accused of terrorism. So could many resistance groups in wartime or freedom fighters struggling with a state ruled by a dictator, as well as participants in civil wars. All irregular groups outside the scope of the Geneva Conventions.A narrower definition would say that terrorism is the use of violence against an innocent population to achieve a political end. This definition would allow freedom fighters and resistance groups to fight back against their oppression, as long as the oppression and their troops were to be the only targets. Yet even this narrow definition is left with grey areas - what if the soldiers and troops were reluctant conscripts? Are civilian settlers in occupied territories legitimate targets as agents of oppression? What about their children? Does it not make a difference whether civilians are armed or unarmed? Do civil servants such as teachers and doctors count as agents of an occupying or oppressive state?There will always be grey areas to be justified, under the broader definition, most armies in history could be accused of terrorism, the bombings of several cities under the Second World War for instance.Terrorism can assist in giving voice to a suppressed cause. The hi-jackings of the 1970s and 1980s brought publicity to the Palestinian cause, helping to bring it to the attention of the world.[2] States can use their wealth, media and influence to broadcast their side of the story and the oppressed, with limited resources, may have to resort to an alternative means of expression. In this way, limited and focused use of violence can have a dramatic international impact. [1]African National Congress. (1961, December 16). Manifesto.

"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"

And if that doesn""t work, try for more money. Imagine yourself in a situation where you are broke. Like flat broke! Turning down opportunities because you can""t even afford it. Now I want my worthy opponents to tell me that money is not the best motivator here. Not having money limits your life. Because money is what drives us. That is the sole reason to work! Leo Rosten has quite truly said, ""Money doesn""t buy happiness. But poverty doesn""t either!"" That one line alone means quite a lot. Money can""t get you friends.

Money is insanely important and you CAN""T live in this world without it, because it is your SURVIVAL KIT! I am well aware that my claim may sound very naive to my worthy opponents, but let me present some realistic instances to please the critics. There are those who work because they""re passionate about their job. But I ask them this, just because they""re passionate, do they work for free? Take the case of any actor. As they climb up the ladder in their career, their value increases. Same is the case of any doctor, footballer or even any engineer! Higher the experience of a doctor, the higher is the pay he demands. Better the resume of an engineer, higher the salary he demands. Even when humans are said to be priceless, the most famous ones have a net worth expressed in the monetary value, because all their life, they have worked hard for that monetary value! At the end, the bottom line comes down to the fact that money is the most important motivator in workplace. Why do you move abroad for better jobs? MONEY! Why do people work for 8 hours a day when they can at least make both ends meet by working for 2 hours? MORE MONEY! TO EVEN FOLLOW YOUR PASSION, you need money! You go to a middle class family and tell him that passion will drive him more. He""ll think you""re mad. Because what is going to feed his family? Passion?

100	S1d787e29-A8fce25d0	0	2	Do we need cash?	money is destroying humans	"My opponent has forfeited the previous round. I have made my points. I will now expand on my points, and make them more all encompassing. 1. Money provides a valuable incentive towards progress Now, what my opponent might be trying to say is that he wants a world where people simply get what they need. However, there is no progress in that sort of world. When everybody simply gets what they need, what motivation is there to succeed? If a person could simply sit around and do nothing, or that person could cure cancer but get the exact same benefits as sitting around and doing nothing, why should he cure cancer? He gets no benefit from it. He has no motivation to cure cancer. However, money solves this problem. The person who cures cancer will be able to receive massive monetary benefit, and people are trying to cure cancer for that exact reason. My opponent might argue that doctors should do this out of pure altruism. However, if that is the only reason, then the amount of brilliant minds searching for this cure would be massively reduced. When the amount of people searching for the cure is reduced, the amount of time to find the cure will be raised, thus slowing human progress. Also, in a world where people are simply given what they need, there are other people who still have to produce the goods and services. However, the same argument stands. If a worker would stand to benefit the same from working or sitting around doing nothing, than why should the worker work? He shouldn""t, because he receives nothing in return for his productivity. The elimination of a monetary system and the transition to an economy based purely on altruism would be catastrophic, and would drastically reduce productivity and slow progress. 2. Money promotes overall economic wellbeing Some of the points made in the previous argument stand here as well. If every person were simply given what they needed to survive, then there would still need to be producers for the goods and services required. With no incentive to produce, there would be far less goods and services produced, meaning that far less goods and services will be distributed, meaning that the overall economy would be worse off.

All the evidence is that providing money directly to those who need it works much better than providing a mishmash of subsidies and credits decided by government. Providing money directly has been working with limited programs around the world, most prominently with Brazil’s Bolsa Familia which has meant millions of children get primary education because of a small cash incentive.[1] In India the state already spends a huge amount on inefficient poverty reduction programs. If all the money that is spent on these programs was transferred to providing for the direct cash payments equally among the 70million households below the poverty line then it would provide a monthly transfer of 2,140 Rs; more than the poverty line income for rural households.[2] [1] Economist, ‘Give the poor money’, 29 July 2010 [2] Kapur, Devesh, et al., ‘More for the Poor and Less for and by the State: The Case for Direct Cash Transfers’, Economic and Political Weekly, 12 April 2008, p.3	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	2	Do we need cash?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind.

Not all Psychopaths and Sociopaths are Killers	Well first off I apologize if it seemed as though I was trying to insult you I simply had a difficult time reading it. And you have expressed your argument in a much more intellectual way that is also more importantly easy to read. I question whether or not you are what you say you are....im not calling you a fibber or liar but were you officially diagnosed or you just feel that way I 100% agree with what you say and did enjoy the articles you shared. and wont argue it BUT I LIKE WINNING. So I will argue the point of being a killer so i can win the debate though you have changed my mind in other ways. You admit to killing animals and are indeed either a psychopath or sociopath if not both. And the Desc. says that they are not all killers. It does not say that they are all murderers especially of human beings. So being a killer simply means taking life and having taken an animals life makes you technically a killer (not murderer) just in a less blockbuster kinda way.	CON	need cash	need cash

People often see it as too much money to sign up to direct debits. People do not want the commitment of having their cash being retracted out of their accounts every month on a set date. Instead, people prefer to make small regular donations when they pass a bucket in the street, or when they see a collection tin at a shopping counter. These charities do valuable work for our society and they will cease to work effectively if we do not use cash. This is not something that Britain would like to see happen. Therefore, it is very unlikely that Britain will abandon cash in favour of cards.	PRO	need cash	need cash

"It""s time to crackdown on cash-point cretins"	"We've all been there on Saturday night, standing patiently in line to withdraw some beer vouchers from the hole in the wall while some mental defective stares blankly at the screen, occasionally pressing buttons, seemingly at random. Jesus Christ on a fvcking bike, what is wrong with these morons? I mean, what's so difficult about withdrawing cash from an ATM? I say it's about time the banks got tough with these cash machine menaces. This is my idea: when users take too long between pressing buttons, say over 5 seconds, certain messages should flash up. To begin with, the messages should be gently encouraging prompts, such as: ""Hurry up!"" and ""Come on, come on, other people want to use this machine as well you know."" Then if the delays continue, a more forthright message should flash up: ""You seem to be taking an extraordinarily long time completing your transaction, what's wrong with you? Are you monged out of your head on drugs or are you just a complete fvcking retard? Press either: A - Sorry, I spent all day on lying on the couch in my underwear eating cold pizza and smoking crack and I'm not thinking straight, just give me a second while I get my fvcking sh!t together dude.' Or: B - Actually, as it happens, I do have profound learning difficulties, thank you very much, and consequently my responses may be somewhat protracted compared to those of so-called 'normal people' but I can assure you I'm doing my best."" The machine should then either allow 20 seconds for the transaction to completed in the case of the first response, or 30 seconds in the case of the second response, and if this time elapses without the cash being withdrawn the following message should appear: ""Right, that's it, you were warned, you were FVCKING warned. Clearly you don't give a flying FVCK about our valued customers waiting behind you, so we're keeping your card to teach you a lesson. You can have it back when you can prove to us that you are fit person to use a bank card and not before. Now FVCK OFF out of everybody's way.""

100	Sc5aa5ce3-A1a2e1899	1	1	Do we need cash?	Guaranteed Minimum Income	"This debate is a clear Pro win as most of my case stands unrefuted. I. Policy Con is hinging his hopes of winning the debate on the libertarianism argument because never responds to most of my damning indictments of the welfare system. Unfortunately, this is a policy debate, not an ethical one; we have to look to whichever plan best solves human problems--the purpose of state policy is to benefit its citizens. His ""reforms"" are vague and dubious, at best. Con says we can just combine similar programs and slim the system down in other ways, but if it were that easy, we would already be doing it. The vast amounts of regulations and precedent make working within the system incredibly hard, it's better to just work outside the system by abolishing it and implementing a system of cash payments. You can vote Pro off of the overhead costs alone. Again, 25% of the systems cost are administrative. Abolish the system and just send people checks and you have 25% more money to work with, right off the bat. Con totally misunderstands the purpose of objecting to the work requirement--it required so much paperwork that overhead costs *skyrocketed* and since the government is so incompetent at enforcing rules, less than a third of people even met the requirement according to the nonpartisan GAO. Obama reformed the system by maintaining the work requirement but letting states opt out *if* they met certain stringent requirements. This is exactly what Con wants, and yet he's arguing that reforms like this don't work. Even if you think Obama made the wrong choice, to pin the failure of the system on this tiny reform as Con does is beyond absurd. Again, Con pretends that he can wave a magic wand and do away with the nonsense of the bureaucrats, but he doesn't have this ability. My plan destroys red tape and minimizes administrative costs.Con says that it's not fair to expect him to come up with a comprehensive plan, but all I really asked for was something to rival my own plan where I gave an analysis on what we should do and how to do it. Cons entire ""plan"" basically boils down to ""make the welfare system better"". In addition, Con never even shows these reforms to be possible. They seem like no brainers, if they were possible they would've already happened. The bureaucracy in the United States has made such a mess that something as simple as a work requirement almost doubled overhead costs and wasn't even enforced. It's time to take power out of the hands of such people. Once more, Con argues that the government has an ""obligation to make sure tax money is being used properly""--if this is true, then his entire case falls because the government is simply incapable of doing this under the current system. 25% of the system goes into the pockets of administrators. $98 billion was paid to people who were ineligible for benefits. People sell their food stamps, anyway. It's dubious to say the least that the common man is so ignorant that his mismanagement of funds allocated to him would come even close to outweighing these costs.Con tries to argue about cost, but you need to reject this argument for three reasons: First, I said in my opening that if we couldn't find the money for a $15,000 GMI we could just scale it down to, say, $13,000 and we would have enough--$15,000 was just a general ballpark number. The point is, converting all of the money in the current system into cash and just sending people checks would be far more beneficial. Maybe Quebec's proposed system would cost more. I've explained mine, Con should've attacked it, not Quebec's. Second, Cons reforms are going to cost, too. He wants to pretend that he's saving money but he won't even say by how much, not even a general ballpark estimate. The welfare system in the US is so broken that fixing it is probably not even be possible or, if it was, would cost so much in administrative costs to make the venture not worthwhile. Third, I'm not even touching Social Security. Social Security is a cash payment to elderly individuals. It doesn't take an Economics Ph.D. to understand how easy it would be to reform this to join a GMI. At the end of the day, what we're looking at is a system so broken that it's better to do away with it entirely and pay the poor in cash. It really is that simple. Since this is a policy debate, you can affirm right here. II. PrincipleI'm grouping libertarianism and the economy of the future here. a) EthicsCons libertarian argument is unpersuasive. He claims that he doesn't have to explain how it's possible to turn the US into a Randian paradise because his argument is about ethical truth value, but this is a policy debate. I think it would be nice if we abolished rape, but unless I can explain how it's possible to do so I gain no impact. Con says I don't establish an ethical framework, but I really don't have to. Not only am I showing that the resolution should be affirmed because it provides more benefits than the status quo, but I've shown that my way is the best way to maintain a libertarian society, so if you want to go with Cons ethical framework in the real world, you affirm.Con agrees that medieval feudalism is as close to a libertarian society as humanity has ever gotten. Thus, we can see why exactly Cons ideas don't work--the Church (which at the time was closely linked with the State, not a private entity like Con characterizes) demanded a tithe, and enough people were willing to pay it because they knew that if they didn't, the poor would rise up and kill them. Starving people don't just say ""Oh, well, I respect the nonaggression principle so my family and I can just die because those aristocrats are paying for their 15 course meals with private money"". They go straight to the nearest farmhouse or manor and take what they need. People don't just quietly die, they go down trying to do what hundreds of millions of years of evolution have taught us to do--survive at all costs. Even from a purely cold hearted, capitalist, non altruistic viewpoint we have no choice but to ensure that people have the means to survive, lest they rise up. The historical landscape is littered with the bodies of hundreds of rulers who failed to understand this concept. As policymakers, we do. Even if you buy that we should be libertarian, the only way to maintain libertarianism is to support the poor and the most libertarian way to support the poor is a cash payment rather than a labyrinth system supporting thousands of government workers in over 100 different agencies. There's a reason that a GMI is mostly advocated for by real world libertarians trying to craft policy.Con thinks that the fact that there were still poor people in the Middle Ages supports his case. It doesn't. The government of today has a quite a bit more coordination power than feudal kings did, and the tithe was *certainly* better for the poor than *nothing*. Con says that we could just have welfare through private organizations, but we know this isn't true because if it was, the state would never have needed to help the poor to begin with. Nothing is stopping private organizations from helping people, but you can't rely on altruism.Moreover, Con never really disputed that modernity has destroyed the possibility of many people to live meaningful lives for the benefit of everyone else. Those people are owed compensation for what was taken from them, just as the farmer is owed compensation when we pave over his land to make a road. b) The economy of the futureCon continually misunderstands this point. As technology increases, the jobs humans can compete with technology in steadily diminish. Remember, in a mere two decades, about half of the jobs that currently exist are likely to be obsolete. Con argues that since fast food restaurants haven't immediately automized, they aren't going to, as if it isn't a gradual process. Frey and Osborne of the University of Oxford predict a 92% chance that fast food labor will become automized in the coming decades[1], along with a myriad of other jobs. Remember, nearly half of jobs are about to become obsolete. It's pretty indisputable that advances in technology are going to push people out of work like it has innumerable times in the past. The reason this time is different and more jobs won't be created is due to what Harari tells us: computers are simply becoming *better* than humans at the tasks the market needs us to perform. The age of the masses is over. Even if I'm wrong about this (and Con hasn't proven so), history still shows that it takes a long time for society to adjust, and we should give people a helping hand. Remember that even if you buy Cons ethical arguments you still have to help the poor. Thus, it's obvious that we need to establish a GMI because it's the best welfare policy. It's in the self interest of pretty much everyone reading this to affirm, because there is a significant chance that our skills too will be overtaken by the machine. Con calls the argument that we're done for anyway his most ""fatal"" objection, but it relies on a very simplistic viewpoint where the existing tax structure doesn't change at all even when most of the population isn't working. Like I said, let the companies innovate and redistribute a part of the profits. Jobs aren't going to disappear overnight, but we should begin facing the problem as soon as we can by creating a more efficient and fair welfare system, tax changes can occur as necessary. In conclusion, throughout this debate I've proven that a simpler system is preferable, ethical, and necessary. My case stands almost entirely unrefuted and all of Cons arguments demonstrate the necessity of establishing a minimum income as welfare reform is entirely unfeasible and a libertarian society demands a guaranteed minimum income. It's in the best interest of us all to ensure a simple and effective welfare system, lest we come to rely on it. Vote Pro. Source:1. http://goo.gl..."	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	S3698a1a-A4b72e98a	0	2	Do we need cash?	Money Can Bring Happiness	"""Happiness is a mental state of well-being characterized by positive emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy."" (1.^ Wordnet 3.0; http://www.google.com...) Notice that ""happiness"" is within the range of ""contentment"" to ""intense joy."" Every single things in the world which brings contentment or joy costs money, must be bought, and therefore, it is money which brings happiness. None of these things can be had without money being spent either by the person experiencing this happiness, or by others spending money so that they can be happy. For example, even people who are ""contented"" with sustanance and covering will realize that both food and shelter costs money. Turn on the news and watch people dying of starvation; do they look happy? The appear to be quite sad. When the worms of hungry brought on by extreme poverty are eating at people, they tend to smile less (or not at all). I certainly don't see them laughing when I turn on the T.V. and see their bones coming out of their chests. How many homeless people do we find acting extremely overjoyed? Not many. You can't be truely happy if you are constantly worried about what to eat and where to shelter or what to wear; and if you can't afford such things it is natural to worry. Con mentions a very rich man saying that he is unhappy, but surely it wasn't having money that made him unhappy. Thousands of quite happy individuals are rich, even amongst the very religious. Just because money brings happiness doesn't entail that once you have money there will not also be sources of sadness and misery that can rob us of that happiness. I think we need to establish the fact that there is more than one source of happiness, so let's not get into this ""saint"" nonsense about happiness coming ""only' from God or religion. For example, marriage is a source of happiness. Many husbands can testify that their wives make them happy. But this doesn't mean they can't get sick, and that sickness burden the family can bring a measure of sadness. If this rich guy Con cited used his money wisely, it would not become a souce of unhappiness for him, just as we we have to use all other things in life wisely to derive the most joy from them. So if a man doesn't treat his wife well, she might make him very unhappy in the long run, so too, he must use his money to his best physical, financial, spiritual, emotional, and intellectual advantage. But such cannot be done unless one has the money to begin with. Christians claim to get their happiness from God, but let's be realistic, they need money to buy clothes to wear to church, and perfume to put on, deoderant, pay for hair-styling and so on. Even members of the church itself would make being there very unhappy for them or they might even be asked to leave if they were to turn up in rags every time church was in session, smelling like rotten eggs. They need money to pay their utility bills so they can bathe and be fresh from church meetings. What on earth can they learn about God in order to even get close to him when instead of listening to the pastor preach and looking up the Scriptures, they are are scratching all over because they didn't bathe and were itching. Thye also need money to buy a Bible is it isn't given away free at church, and even the church had to buy it, and before that it costs money to print. In fact, it cost money for the translators of many Bible versions to go to universities to study different languages and so on to become qualified to embark on Bible translation. Without money religions couldn't fund their preaching work, and so people wouldn't learn about God in order to draw close to him. Without money they would have to buildings for worship. So let's be realistic, religion cost's money; so even the happiness that comes from religion must be bought. Thus, money buys happiness. Marriage brings happiness, but the rings must be bought. The wedding is an expensive affair. All the things we like, favorite foods, movies, music, sports, all costs money. We tend to feel better psycologically when we have money in out hands than when we are broke. So let's not kid ourselves. Sure, they are some poor people who appear to be quite satisfied with life; but really, even the little they do have costs money. There is ""some level"" of money they ""must"" have in order to maintain that happiness. This debate isn't about if being ""rich"" makes you happy; but rather, if ""money"" brings happiness. Whatever it is you want to achieve in life to make you happy, you need money to get there, and without that amount of money, you can't be happy. Even if Con could show us that they are people who can be happy without money, this would not prove that money is not a source of happiness. To illustrate, surely there are many single people who are happy, does that mean that marriage is not a source of happiness? No. One thing is for sure, poorness doesn't bring happiness at all. A husband and wife bickering over how to spend their last hundred dollars is not what I call a happy marriage. Con says that money is just paper with something printed on it, but so are books, and yet look at how much joy people get out of reading novels, or religious texts like the Bible, poetry books, comics, and the list goes on. When a man writes a letter back home to his wife saying ""I love you, and I'm coming home tomorrow,"" after a long business trip, she smiles with joy - that paper with something printed on it sure did make her happy; likewise, money too may just be paper and ink, but when a man hands a check donation of one million dollars over to the church I'm sure the pastor is quite happy; when a man wins the lottery I'm sure it makes him quite happy, and I dare my opponent in this debate to receive a billion dollars and not smile from ear to ear like a little child on the happiest day of his life. The actor Con spoke of said ""Everyone pretends to love me but they love my money,"" so is Con saying that we should strive to be poor so that people won't pretend to be our friends? It says in one of Con's links, ""If money promises happiness, then why are the wealthiest people in the world also not the happiest people in the world?"" http://www.richardslavin.com... But what statistical data does he give to back that up? Was a survey done asking all the rich people how happy they were on a scale of 1 to 10? And let me ask, does the survey also show that the poorest people in the world are the happiest? I'm sure that if you were to ask a set of 1000 very rich people how happy they were and 1000 poverty stricken, homeless, hungry, sick people who happy they were on a scale of 1 to 10, the rich would definitely fair better in terms of whose happier. Don't believe me? Pick your random homeless person and ask him when was the last time he had fun. Hard to do that when you can't afford medication. But I never claimed rich people are the happiest, for I never claimed they are not greater sources of happiness out there than money; so it's very deceptive of your source to ask why the richest aren't the happiest, as if that was ever a claim they made. Just because married people aren't the ""happiest"" people on earth, does that prove marriage can't bring happiness? Marriage and money bring happiness even if other things do a better job of making one happy. My argument is against those who claim money can't make you happy at all. And how does one measure happiness anyway? What is your definition of ""happiest""? What statistical proof do you have to show that another source makes people ""happier"" than money? I look forward to Con's response."	PRO	need cash	need cash

100	S96d0b752-Aa6933769	0	2	Do we need cash?	China is a threat to the United States economically.	"The way I see it, there are 2 main arguments. One is of course, whether or not China will be willing to hurt their own economy by ""cashing in"" on bonds or ceasing trade with the US, and the other is what a threat is. Point 1: To see if China will act upon their growing economy to hurt the United States, we must look at what would happen if trade ceased. I agree that the US would be hurt as well, but I am arguing China will not take the risk of hurting not only relations with the US, but also their own economy. I did a little digging, and I found what the damage to China's exports would be if they dropped the United States. I found this from China Daily, China's only English-language newspaper. They say; ""According to US statistics, China's export to the United States was $243.5 billion last year, accounting for 32 per cent of China's $762 billion total exports and 14.6 percent of US total imports. This demonstrates the fact that China and the United States are big markets to each other. In 1994, the US Department of Commerce listed China as the head of its top 10 newly emerging markets, which has been proven over the past 10 years."" To see this article, go to this site: http://www.chinadaily.com.cn... Now, please note that 32% of China's exports go to the US. They may be able to get some of that back from other nations, but 32% is pushing very far. This proves that China has major incentive to keep trading with the United States. This leads to my next point. Point 2: According to the definition you provided, for a someone or something to be a threat, it must have intention. According to US Trade Representatives, the market between China and the US is booming. Coming from both ways. Demand for American goods is high in China and China has become a major trade partner with the US. And do I even need to talk about imports to the US? Does it sound like China would have intentions to hurt the US? I think not.

100	S82b6fb54-Aacdc5d6f	1	2	Do we need cash?	The deficit presents no solvency risk to the United States	"I thank my opponent for the opportunity to debate this very important topic.I will begin by a review of the monetary system that has been in place in the United States since 1971 and is currently in place in the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and Switzerland among others. Note that I will not be discussing the Eurozone system (unless required to for rebuttal) as the way their monetary system works is completely different. I will focus on the United States (and unless I say otherwise this is the country I'm talking about), but most of what I argue would also be applicable to any country where the national government is the monopoly issuer of the currency, the currency is non-convertible, and there are free-floating exchange rates.1. All government spending is ""new money""When you examine the way government payments are made, it becomes apparent that government spending always introduces new money into the private sector. Ben Bernake admitted as much in his interview with 60 Minutes when he said ""The banks have accounts with the Fed, much the same way that you have an account in a commercial bank. So, to lend to a bank, we simply use the computer to mark up the size of the account that they have with the Fed.""[1]. All government spending works this way[2,3]. The government does not ""borrow"" or ""print"" money, rather it simply spends it into the economy. This is true whether the spending is payment to a contractor for construction of a bridge, or a social security payment. Let's consider the latter.My grandmother (who will we will see again later) has $3000 in her bank account. When she is supposed to get her $1000 social security payment, all the Treasury does is instruct her bank to change the '3' to a '4' in the computer system. There are a number of accounting entries that occur at the same time, but the net effect is $1000 has been added to the private sector. Nobody at Treasury is on the phone to china to borrow the money nor trying to jam a gold coin into the keyboard. They just change the number.When taxes are paid the reverse happens. If the payment is electronic, the amount of tax paid is simply removed from the account (and thus the economy). If one were to pay taxes in cash, the IRS would issue a receipt and then throw the cash in a shredder.[4,5] The bills have served their purpose as a carryable alternative to numbers in a bank computer system. They are of no value to the government.The monetary system exists to further commerce and economic development. The government acts as scorekeeper for the monetary system. Just as a score-keeper in a card game can never run out of points, the government can never run out of dollars.2. The ""debt"" is just the sum of previous deficits""One way to think about the debt is as accumulated deficits.""[6] That is, if you add up the deficits (the amount more the government spends than it takes in each year) you get the debt. Calling it ""debt"" is really historical term from a time when the dollar was tied to gold. Under that system the government would need to borrow gold (or gold backed instruments) to spend gold backed instruments. This is no longer how it works.[7] The government does not need to borrow before it can spend nor does it need to tax before it spends. In fact, as we have seen, the dollars that are used to buy treasury bills or pay taxes entered the private sector through government spending.3. Swapping asset classes has no impact on the solvency of the U.S. governmentIn addition to collecting social security my grandmother holds U.S. savings bonds. Can you imagine her saying, ""Gee I wish the government would force me to give these bonds back in exchange for cash""? Of course not. Neither her nor the government's current financial position would be in any way changed by swapping a $100 bond for a $100 bill, although my grandmother would need to find a new place to save.Savings is a demand leakage[8]. When people save, they are not spending all that they earn. This means that they are consuming less than they produce resulting in unsold goods or services elsewhere in the economy. Unless these goods and services are sold then producers will scale back and the productivity of the economy will spiral down. The government deficit injects new money to offset these demand leakages.4. Inflation (optional point)Although a discussion of inflation is not necessary to uphold the proposition, since many people on the comments board for this debate have raised it, I will address it nonetheless. Inflation is a continual process of rising prices.[9] It is not an increase in money supply, although one can sometimes cause another. Thus, the ability of the government to run a deficit is not completely unconstrained, although it is not constrained by its ability to borrow or tax. The ability of a government (of the sort I've been discussing) to spend is constrained by the ability of its economy to produce.Government spending causes inflationary pressure regardless of whether there is offsetting borrowing. It is the extra consumption that drives up prices not the extra money. Three quick examples: First, f the government prints $100 trillion, seals it in concrete and sinks it to the bottom of the ocean, there would be no economic impact whatsoever (except perhaps trivially on the paper, ink, and concrete markets). It's not the printing, it's the spending that matters. On the other hand, let's say the economy produces and the American public consumes 1 million cars per year. If the government buys 200,000 cars, then they have increased demand and this will put upward pressure on the price of cars. Again, it doesn't matter how they got the money. They could sell gold from Fort Knox to buy cars or they could just invent dollars to buy cars. The result is the same, the price of cars is set by the supply and demand for cars. Finally, if the government taxes the population, then money is removed from the private sector so some people who would have bought cars won't now. This effect will lessen the impact of the government spending.At any rate, the government is not ""running out"" of money and does not need to ""borrow"" more to continue spending. How big the deficit should be is a matter for political debate, but there is no solvency risk. We should decided how much government spending we want (how many teachers, how many soldiers) and then set the tax rate to keep inflation low, but there is no solvency risk. The government can always pay its debts. The proposition should be affirmed.References[1] http://www.cbsnews.com...[2] http://www.fms.treas.gov...[3] http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov...[4] http://www.moneyfactorystore.gov...[5] http://www.newyorkfed.org...[6] http://www.treasurydirect.gov...[7] http://www.businessweek.com...[8] http://www.unc.edu...[9] http://www.merriam-webster.com..."

100	S195e5f1a-A83531d7e	0	2	Do we need cash?	The Federal Defense of Marriage Act is Unconstitutional	"I'd like to welcome my opponent to Debate.org and wish him the best of luck in this debate. To preface my opening remarks, I'd like to stress that the criteria by which the readers should judge this debate. We are debating only the constitutionality of The Federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Even if DOMA is inconclusively unfair, unprogressive, or immoral; if it is determined to be constitutional, then the vote should go to Con. Likewise, if DOMA cannot be upheld within the framework of the U.S. Constitution regardless of its other qualities, you must vote Pro. I say this not to insult the readers' intelligence, but only to gently remind them to judge according to the resolution and not towards the emotion that is sure to spring from this topic. I offer my own summary of DOMA: ""The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) does two things. First, it provides that no State shall be required to give effect to a law of any other State with respect to a same-sex 'marriage.' Second, it defines the words 'marriage' and 'spouse' for purposes of Federal law."" (1) I'd also like to put forth a definition of marriage: ""Marriage is an institution in which interpersonal relationships (usually intimate and sexual) are acknowledged by the state or by religious authority."" (2) OPENING REMARKS: 1. DOMA does not violate Full Faith and Credit. The first effect of DOMA is written in Section 2: Powers Reserved to the States. The purpose of this section can be clarified by the history that led to its drafting. In 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court ""ruled that the state's prohibition of same-sex marriages amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex."" (4) The writing on the wall was clear to both proponents and opponents of homosexual marriage. If it were officially acknowledge in Hawaii, then same-sex couples could get married in Hawaii and have their marriage legally transferred to any other state via the Full faith and Credit clause. Up to this point, states could choose how to recognize homosexual marriage, sometimes opting for a separate institution, the civil union. Now, however, they saw such liberties being threatened. Congress had two choices, simply let Full Faith and Credit compel all states to recognize same-sex marriage, or act to preserve state sovereignty over the marriage institution. DOMA is the effort towards the latter. The surprise to many readers may be that the Full Faith and Credit clause is actually the authority by which Congress was able to enact DOMA. The complete clause states, ""Full faith and credit ought to be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings, of every other state; and the legislature shall, by general laws, prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings, shall be proved, and the effect which judgments, obtained in one state, shall have in another."" (5) My opponent deftly quoted only half the clause. While the clause does force states to recognize ""public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings"" of other states it also grants Congress the right to prescribe the manner in which such things are recognized. In this case, Congress uses the power of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to defer to the states the rights to choose which marriages they will accept or deny from other states. DOMA does not violate Full Faith and Credit; it is sanctioned by it. 2. DOMA does not violate Equal Protection. The second effect of DOMA is written in Section 3: Definition of Marriage. As stated in my proposed definition of marriage, it is an institution. Like all institutions, it must be clearly defined. In the past, the words marriage, spouse, husband, and wife were all understood to refer to heterosexual union. Even today, mention that someone is married, and the listener is more likely to assume a heterosexual union. Thus, when marriage, husband, wife, and spouse were written into the constitution, no clarifications were made as to the gender of the marriage parties because they were incorporated into the understood definition of marriage in that time. Since then, marriage is getting redefined. Even my own definition offered in this debate is gender agnostic. Again, Congress was faced with two choices. They could leave marriage open to interpretation and risk allowing the Federal court system to override State sovereignty over the matter, or they could clarify the marriage institution as heterosexual and allow the states to develop the institutions they see fit. Once again, they chose to give states authority over their marriage institutions. As a result, the Federal Government officially recognizes the heterosexual marriage institution and leaves all other marriage institutions into the hands of the states. The Equal Protection clause states that ""no state shall… deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" (6) DOMA clarifies that all past marriage laws in the books refer to the heterosexual marriage institution and not other marriage institutions. Thus, there is a distinction between types of marriage. This does not violate Equal Protection because DOMA does not deny any person the right to enter into heterosexual marriage. Furthermore, it does not prevent any state from creating other marriage institutions with the very same legal protections as heterosexual marriage. Therefore, DOMA does not violate Equal Protection. To further clarify this point, it's important to understand that Equal Protection does not mean that all people get all protections of all laws. All laws discriminate to some degree. For example, laws protecting the specific rights of biological mothers discriminate against biological fathers and legal guardians. It would be irrational to claim that, under Equal Protection, all parents are given the same rights as biological mothers. It is perfectly constitutional to create laws that offer protections to a group based on role, be it parent, spouse, worker, etc. REBUTTALS: My opponent is outright false when claiming that DOMA is ""clearly designed to discourage homosexual relationships"" and it ""explicitly outlaws gay marriage."" I've linked to the original text of DOMA below, and nowhere does it expressly outlaw same-sex marriage, nor is there any clear design to discourage homosexual relationships. DOMA simply defers marriage matters to the state, nothing more. My opponent claims that separate marriage institutions fall into the separate-but-equal standard dealt with in ""Brown v. Board of Education."" This entire argument is based on a presupposition that homosexuality is biologically constitutional and not learned behavior. If he wishes, he may offer evidence that shows homosexuality to be as innate as skin color, in which case, Equal Protection will indeed come into play. If, however, homosexuality is a lifestyle, then the separate-but-equal case does not apply. I'll let my opponent expand on this if he so chooses. Regarding strict scrutiny, DOMA has a very compelling government interest. When more than half the states react negatively to having to provide Full Faith and Credit to same-sex marriages in other states, Congress has a very real interest in responding. (1) CONCLUSION: I am well aware that DOMA creates deep controversy, but it should also be recognized that State liberties are a pivotal American government construct. DOMA sets out to protect those liberties. While it presents another obstacle towards nationwide acknowledgement of same-sex marriage, in no way does DOMA violate the U.S. Constitution.

Money cannot be targeted to meet specific needs	Governments have accepted, in documents like the universal declaration of human rights, that one of their primary roles is to provide a basic standard of living for their citizens. When the state simply hands out some money this responsibility is not fulfilled. The state is simply leaving the poor to fend for themselves with a little extra money. Governments provide subsidies in kind or for specific products and services for a reason; those are the things that are necessities rather than luxuries. If money is transferred directly then the person who is getting the money can use the government’s money on anything. Some may use it on the things the government was providing before but others will spend the money badly on tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Subsidies however can be targeted at the things that the poor really need. This means the state provides subsidies for food, free or cheap housing and healthcare, fuel for cooking and heating etc. 	PRO	need cash	need cash

Because of money, people are forced to steal, tempted to kill, and many have to spend a dangerous amount of time away from their family for work. People starve, people go without housing or hygiene, and people are forced to be segregated into rich and poor, or separated into a hierachy. People have to wait years in some cases just to get medical care - and because of funding issues (as well as, of course reasonable testing) medicines and technology that could help the environment have to wait a decade oftentimes to get on the market. People get greedy,and destroy other people's lives for money. Some people will do anything for money. People waste money instead of helping those who don't have it, and frankly, don't need it because if we scrapped the whole economy and lived without one, the world would be a much less evil place and it would be friendly and co-operative. Look at other species, such as ants, wolves, lions, wildebeest, and dolphins, and notice how they live in a community that works together, and as would we naturally, if you look at Aborigines, Native Americans, African natives, Indonesia and Islander natives, Amazon natives.

100	S49eee388-Ab3129aa2	0	1	Do we need cash?	The United States National Debt is the Amount of Money the United States has Created not Borrowed	"Thanks for the quick reply akphidelt. ==What is M1 and M2?== I actually made a mistake before, which I now realized after looking up the definition of M2. M2 is everything in M1 (cash), PLUS savings (checking and savings accounts). [1] So the total money supply in the US is only $9.168 trillion. My opponent keeps saying you should reject M2 because it's too complicated. It's really not – M2 is the total amount of money in circulation. We don't count money in central banks (whether in the US or in foreign countries) in M2 because that money is not in circulation; it just sits on a balance sheet. $9 trillion still doesn't equal $14.6 trillion in government debt. ==Should we exclude intragovernmental debt from debt measurements?== My opponent contradicts himself so much that it's astounding. We should exclude intragovernmental debt because it makes it easier for my opponent to match it to his measurements of the amount of money circulation, but we should INCLUDE this measure when measuring whether Clinton reduced debt. You can't have it both ways. We should either count this as borrowing or not. We can't do both based on what suits our needs. ==My opponent's calculation of $9.6 trillion== Firstly, my opponent just cherry picks the numbers that add up to the number he wants. If you look to 1980, for example, national debt was $1.2 trillion [2] but the money supply was $2 trillion. [3] Say what you want about the money supply, but if you believe that all cash is created by debt, you CANNOT believe that there would ever be more money in circulation than debt. Second, he does a lot of double counting. A bank's net equity is defined as their assets minus their liabilities. However, bank deposits are assets and loans are liabilities, so he counts these twice, for example (the 1.5 number and the 2.4 number). Also, currency in circulation also includes savings accounts, which can easily be converted into usable currency. Cash in bank vaults is also a deposit. If you double count enough and cherry pick the numbers that add up to the one you want, of course you can succeed. Also, of course my opponent must exclude intragovernment debt because he couldn't find enough numbers, without triple or quadruple counting, to add up to $14 trillion. ==Money supply existed before debt== My opponent says, ""The $11 billion of gold still priced at $42 per ounce [3], which is equivalent to $473 billion ($1600 ounce) in present value."" First, how does $11 billion of gold at current value (what the Fed lists on their website) turn into $473 billion in value. I think my opponent changed $11 billion in gold to 11 billion ounces of gold, which is not what the source says. When a bank owns an asset (whether gold or a house), it lists the value of the assets under assets. So $11 billion of gold means they own gold currently valued at $11 billion. ==Fed purchase of Treasuries did not increase the money supply== Remember, the resolution says that when the government issues debt, it creates money. My opponent's own source said that QE2 bought Treasuries but failed to increase liquidity, meaning banks did not lend out any more money, so this failed to ""create"" money. ==Temporarily selling to banks who sell the Treasuries== My opponent says, ""If the Govt issues $1 trillion in debt and the banks purchase it with bank money, then the Govt credits the nonbank public $1 trillion... then the nonbank public now has $1 trillion more to invest in treasuries."" How does the government credit $1 trillion to the public, and where can I collect my share of that (approximately $500 billion)? This literally makes no sense; the government can't just credit money to us; does it sneak into our bank accounts, like the tooth fairy, and give us money? The bank temporarily holds onto the Treasury until a real buyer exchanges real cash for it. ==??????== My opponent says, ""We do not need your tax dollars or China's money to fund our spending. It is funded behind the scenes with collaboration between the Fed's, Primary Dealers, and the Treasury."" I guess we don't ""need"" any of those things, but we do use them, since the Primary Dealers don't keep the Treasuries. In addition, financial markets aren't stupid. If the US pays its debts by simply creating money, this causes massive inflation. We do NEED real purchasers to give us real cash money or inflation occurs. ==Banks don't use deposits== This still doesn't answer the argument that real cash is exchanged for the Treasury bond, ultimately. 95% of what my opponent responds to is just a red herring, since it's not central to my argument. ==Clinton== It's undeniable that the government can run huge surpluses if it wanted to. Even if Clinton did this by running surpluses in Social Security, we could ALSO do it by eliminating all military spending, for example, or by privatizing Social Security. This means that it IS possible to pay down the national debt. Nitpicking what Clinton did doesn't disprove the OBVIOUS general argument that I was making, that the government CAN pay down the debt if it wants to, which my opponent completely denied in his Round 1. Last, let's look to the dropped voters (which it's too late for my opponent to respond to now). Vote Con if you agree that: 3) You believe the government can pay off its debt whenever it chooses to, without shrinking the money supply. 4) You believe that Treasuries are sold for cash at the END POINT. Cash is traded for Treasuries, ultimately, and we use that cash to deficit spend (example, China buying our debt). 6) You believe that the Fed doesn't even need to issue debt to print money. It could just use a printing press, which is the whole point of the floating currency. The government can OBVIOUSLY create money without issuing debt. The other voters were already extended internally. Here's a new voter: remember 1980. Money supply was FAR larger than national debt. That shouldn't be able to happen if my opponent is right.

You say the money is the root of many problems. Before i give you my opinion on why it isn't a bad thing, I'll tell you why i think it is a good thing. First, money allows us to buy things. That may sound simple, but it's true. I buy food with money. I buy clothes with money, I pay bills with money. I pay for other services with money. Why? Because everyone accepts money. Try to imagine a world without money. How would I buy my food? Unless I had a really generous farmer next door who would give me free food all the time, I would have no food, unless I could grow it for myself. Think of society today. We get things from everywhere. We buy food from the supermarket. We buy clothes from clothes stores. We buy appliances from appliance stores. We buy medicine from pharmacies. Without money, how would we get everything we need? Unless I could make my own food, clothes, appliances, home, medicine, education, and everything else I need, I would need money. Why? Because money is how we trade. If we don't have money, we have basically no trade. If we have no trade, everyone needs to be able to produce everything they would need to survive. Which isn't really possible. So, about your arguments. I disagree with all of them. If we take money out of the equation, crime will still exist. It would probably get worse. If I have a TV someone wants, and they have no money to pay for it, they can still steal it. money is not the only thing of value in the world today. Taking it away just gives people one less way to get what they need. You also assume everyone would be able to get a job. Jobs are selling services or products. Who's going to be buying if there is no MONEY? There'd be less jobs. What would workers get paid with? You can't expect people to work with no pay. How would it provide more shelter? More shelter means more homes to be built. People usually won't build homes unless they are PAID. You assume money is the root of our problems. However, I don't see any evidence as to why money is not needed. Please tell me WHY we don't need money. You say people would work better cooperatively than competitively. With no competitive drive, no one needs to succeed. With no one needing to succeed, there is no success. No success, and we're stuck Please convince me next round.	CON	need cash	need cash

Without the higher fees that come from international students, UK students would be paying a lot more than they are, which would be bad for several reasons. Firstly, it would lower the numbers of UK students who go to university, particularly from poorer backgrounds. Education is the best way to get out of poverty, so keeping poor people out of education is self-evidently a bad thing. Secondly, and consequently, it would lower the number of graduates in the job market. Graduates are an increasingly valuable resource in our economy, which transformed to a predominantly service-based economy (with manufacturing outsourced to e.g. China). Having lots of graduates is a good thing for the British economy. Thirdly, it would push taxes up as the government would need to find money to pay for higher education from somewhere else. A high tax burden is not a good thing for a country, as it means the general populace has less money to spend on the goods and services that keep the economy buoyant. Because higher fees from international students keeps the cost down not only for UK students but indeed the UK taxpayer, this 'discrepancy' should remain.	PRO	need cash	need cash

The Legend of Zelda is Nintendo's greatest property	"Though you bring up great points about longest running and most valuable properties, many of those Mario titles are cheap cash trap spinoffs such as Mario Party 5-now, Mario tennis games, Mario golf, and virtually every other sport in existence. Some of these games are good, but many are mediocre to terrible. Pokemon is a very powerful driving force for Nintendo. It is of their most profitable franchises, and for good reason. It provides simple, graspable RPGs and a similarly functioning TCG. It is accessible, and fun. However, neither franchise stands up to the Legend of Zelda. The Legend of Zelda series is a timeless group of powerful games that revolutionized a genre. While Mario was released parallel to Megaman, and there were hundreds of RPG's by the time Pok""mon arrived, the Legend of Zelda was the first true adventure game. Then Ocarina of Time invented z-targeting and created the first true 3D adventure game. The Legend of Zelda series constantly pushes the envelope of what a non FPS action adventure title is. Zelda turns 30 this August in America, and already has in Japan. According to Zelda Indormer, which cited Nintendo financial releases, it has sold 70 million copies of video games for a huge amount of money, not including merchandise. Though Mario and Pokemon are iconic, mainstream, and forever more popular for their accessibility, the Zelda fan base is massive, and the games are revolutionary."	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	S2476225d-A8b957096	0	2	Do we need cash?	Welfare Should Be Abolished.	"Thank you for proving to us that you didn't read the rules. Round 1 is acceptance from Con. My main argument will be that ""Welfare Does More Harm Than Good"" Let's get straight to it! Argument #1 Welfare gets taken advantage of. It's quite obvious that women continue to have children to receive welfare checks. Sadly, these checks get taken advantage of by not using the money for what it's actual purpose is for. If we cut the system entirely, imagine how many women would stop having children. They wouldn't continue having children because then that means they wouldn't be receiving more money. [1] What would happen to the poor if welfare were eliminated? Without the negative incentives created by the welfare state, fewer people would be poor. There would also likely be fewer children born into poverty. Studies suggest that women do make rational decisions about whether to have children, and thus a reduction in welfare benefits would reduce the likelihood of their becoming pregnant or having children out of wedlock. Another problem is that these receivers continuously apply for food stamps, though they don't actually need them. Allot of fraud goes on as well with people applying and selling food stamps to those who aren't on welfare. On February 15,2015 Brushton, New York, 30 people were arrested for eligibly selling food stamps. [2]NY State Police-Malone said via WPTZ that those arrested were using their food stamp cards in a manner that was against the law. All allegedly bought alcohol, received cash, and bought other items food stamp recipients are not allowed to buy using a food stamp card, known as the Electronic Benefits Card (EBT). Police charged all defendants with second degree criminal use of a public benefit card, petit larceny, and misuse of food stamps. Though most were released with an appearance ticket, one defendant was held for parole violations, reports WPTZ. Not only was the system being taken advantage of once more, but imaging how easily kids would be able to get alcohol as well. [3] This type of fraud, called trafficking according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, happens by exchanging food stamps for cash. Trafficking food stamps happens at an extreme “street exchange rate,” which can range anywhere from $.25 to $.50 per dollar, according to WSPA. This means that for every $1 in EBT benefits sold, the recipient gets $.50 to $.75 in cash. According to Addicting Info, the stigma about this type of welfare abuse or food stamp fraud is that it is unusually high because it is so easy to do. Resolution: Instead of providing food stamps, charities could help out tremendously. Many charities are willing to help the needy in any way they can. For instance, there are organizations that cook and provide food to the needy. Why don't we replace providing food stamps, and do it in a much safer way. All food stamp receiving families should be introduced to SNAP. [3] SNAP offers nutrition assistance to millions of eligible, low-income individuals and families and provides economic benefits to communities. SNAP is the largest program in the domestic hunger safety net. The Food and Nutrition Service works with State agencies, nutrition educators, and neighborhood and faith-based organizations to ensure that those eligible for nutrition assistance can make informed decisions about applying for the program and can access benefits. FNS also works with State partners and the retail community to improve program administration and ensure program integrity. So, not only will they be receiving food, they can also learn about how to make healthy choices and presume a healthy lifestyle. This is also a benefit for children growing up who had never been taught about healthy food decisions. Argument #2 [4] It is less efficient than private charity. Private, local charity is true charity: it is voluntary, and it is not subject to the bureaucratic filtering process. I have never heard the government or any of its programs praised for efficiency, except by the government and those who head the programs! There are many willing charities that are eager to help the needy in any way possible. Why not let them? [5] If you need help with paying your rent or bills, including your electric or heating bills, you can look into the following local and national charities and non-profit organizations. A number of other services may be provided by a charity, including free food, housing, basic needs such as clothing, and much more. Various programs and services are offered by charities, as noted below. Unfortunately the resources available from these organizations tends to be limited, and only a certain number of people can be assisted. This is mostly due to the high demand placed on the charities. Much of the aid is focused on people who are most at risk. This can include senior citizens, families with very young children, and the disabled. Even if a charity or non-profit can’t meet your needs, ask them for referrals. Or maybe they have a waiting list that you can sign up for. Just because this is limited doesn't mean it's a bad thing. They will help those who are in most need and are assuredly unable to sustain a proper lifestyle. Many of these systems wouldn't be taken advantage of because people are actually helping you out. They don't just give you money and say ""Here you go, your monthly check, do whatever you please with it"" Nope. These organizations are making sure you use this money wisely and effectively. Some of these organizations include: [4] Community Action Organizations are local public and/or non-profit groups that provide various types of assistance to those in need. They can help with heating and utility bills, provide job training, rent payments, and various other services. Episcopal Church - This is a national organization, but the services run by each local parish vary. The charity supports the vulnerable and families living in poverty. Volunteers can provide basic needs such as personal hygiene items, clothing, hot meals, or food. Some of the parishes of this charity may also have more extensive support, even involving health clinics held by volunteers or loans to use for car repairs. Continue with services from Episcopal Church. Non-profit credit counseling agencies operate in many cities and counties. These organizations will usually charge clients a small fee for their services. However, if your income is low enough, then the debt reduction and other financial services may be offered for free, as a charity type service. Find a listing of free or low cost non-profit credit counseling agencies. Note that these people are actually willing and happy to help those in need.

100	S1eafdd13-A977bc964	0	2	Do we need cash?	There are no compelling proofs or arguments for the existence of God	I would like to thank my con for putting forward such a complex and intriguing argument which really caught me off guard, but after a bit of thought and I research I think I can put together a response. None of these rebuttals are original and are all available in some form on the internet, I simply worded them differently for the purposes of my own understanding. Problems with PSR* In actual practice scientists explain the existence of occurrences or things in terms of preceding causes and conditions, temporarily taking the latter things to be brute facts unless or until they, too, can be further explained. But the principle implicit in the PSR sort of search for explanations isn't sufficient to generate the need for an explanation of the universe as a whole in terms of a necessary being. In other words, using PSR to postulate a God-like figure is premature and superfluous as the universe itself cannot yet be explained. (1)* PSR absurdly entails that everything is brought about of necessity. The argument for this can be stated as follows. Consider the conjunction of all contingencies (CC). By the logic of PSR, there is a sufficient reason for CC. Now the sufficient reason for CC is itself either contingent or necessary. But it can’t be contingent, because then it would represent a contingent fact, in which case it would itself be a part of CC. But contingent facts don’t contain within themselves the sufficient reason for why they exist – let alone the sufficient reason for why all contingencies exist. Thus, the sufficient reason for CC must be necessary. But whatever is entailed by a necessary truth is itself necessary, in which case all truths would be necessary truths, and the objects they represent would obtain of necessity. But this is absurd. Therefore, PSR is false. (1)* The following scenario is on the face of it possible: there are just two kinds of beings that exist: contingent-and-dependent beings (e.g., rocks, trees, planets, galaxies, you and me) and contingent-yet-independent, “free-standing” beings, out of which all contingent-and-dependent beings are made (an example could be matter/energy). If so, then even though there are possible worlds at which the contingent-yet-independent beings 'don’t exist', they are eternal and indestructible at all possible worlds in which they 'do exist'. On this account, then, there are contingent beings that come to be and pass away: the contingent-and-dependent beings such as you and me. But the beings out of which they’re made – i.e the contingent-yet-independent beings - do not; nor can they. This scenario seems possible. But if so, then since PSR entails that such a state of affairs is impossible, then so much the worse for PSR. (1)Sources (1) http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.co.uk...	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	Scee72b1d-A4ba3f04a	0	2	Do we need cash?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	need cash	need cash

100	S75f1aae-A8cb8a283	0	2	Do we need cash?	Rematch Debate: God Exists	R1) Teleological Argument I accept that the universe is an LPU. But this is no justification for intelligent design, as this is easily subject to reductio ad absurdum, wherein one might say the universe is an RPU -- a rock permitting universe. If the universe has to be ‘finely-tuned’ for life, it would also have to be ‘finely-tuned’ for rocks. This is ascribing intrinsic value to life with no justification. Now, Pro’s teleological premises are that the universe could have been an LPU by “chance, necessity or intelligent design.” The universe could have also been an RPU similarly, etc. But to ascribe something with actual value is incoherent, thus the ideal analogy is that the universe is a “universe-permitting universe”, i.e. the universe exists out of either chance, design or physical necessity. Now, I shall be supporting the concept that the universe could exist out of physical necessity with equal probability as intelligent design. Pro says the universe being non-LPU is not absurd, thus it is not necessarily an LPU. This variation of the teleological argument is referred to as the ‘fine-tuning’ argument, i.e. the idea that the universe is unique in that it is a universe fine-tuned for life, with the physical constant values of the universe [1]. According to philosopher Theodore M. Drange, “Other values for physical constants [are] highly improbable. … [T]he burden of proof is still on the advocates of FTA [to show that other values for physical constants are possible].” [2] Furthermore, “[Michael Hurben and Theodore Drange] have offered various objections to this new argument to design: that the values of the various physical constants aren't really ‘tunable’ and thus couldn't have been ‘set’ to anything other than the values we find.” [3] According to particle physicist and philosopher Victor J. Stenger, “[I]t can be shown that the conditions necessary for the evolution of some form of life would have arisen from a wide variation in physical constants.” [4] While I do not outright reject the fine-tuned universe hypothesis, as Drange poses, how is it possible for the universe to have been ‘tuned’ otherwise? Stenger also posits that our ‘type’ of life, i.e. carbon-based life, need not be the only type of life possible [5]. According to inflationary theory, “an inflaton field in the first 10−30 seconds of the universe produces strong repulsive gravity, and the universe and space-time expand by a factor of 1030. After 10−30 seconds, gravity starts to become attractive. In this framework, with such rapid expansion, the overall shape of the universe at 14 billion years is much less sensitive to initial parameters … thus, the fine-tuning issue disappears.” [6] Andre Linde proposed a theory of ‘chaotic inflation’, “the peaks in the evolution of a scalar field (determining the energy of the vacuum) correspond to regions of rapid inflation which dominate.” [7] This theory of eternal inflation was proven by Paul Steinhardt and Alexander Vilenkin independently, and further supported by Alan Guth [8]. This allows for a wholly naturalistic explanation for fine-tuning [9]. Stephen Hawking proposed that the early universe was a superposition of possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions we see today, thus providing a further naturalistic explanation for fine-tuning [10]. Therefore, physical necessity has equal probability as intelligent design, and the argument does not affirm God’s existence. Thus, the teleological argument is refuted. C1) Incoherence of a Caused Universe a) Requirements for Causation First, I shall refute Pro’s analogy of simultaneous causation. Pro asserts that when one sits down, the cause (sitting down) and the effect (causing depression on the cushion) happen at the same time. This is incorrect, as it takes time (i.e. t > 0) for the effect to occur after the cause. In other words, after sitting, it takes an extremely small, albeit finite, amount of time for the cushion to be depressed. For simultaneous causation to be possible, one assumes a presentist ontology of time. As special and general relativity entail eternalism, simultaneous causation is likely impossible. Pro asserts that the cause and effect are not ‘spatially separated’, but since they are (as illustrated above) temporally separated, if eternalism is true, then they are dimensionally separated, and, thus, spatially separated, by the definition of four-dimensionalism [10]. Eternalism, four-dimensionalism and the B-theory of time are all entailed by each other, thus four-dimensionalism is also likely true. The deductive syllogism presented by Pro is entirely cognitive and subjective, and does not include metaphysical causation as described in God’s creation of the universe. This is not a metaphysical causal relationship, and *metaphysical* causal relationships require metaphysical restrictions [11]. b) Eternalism “I would like to say here that eternalism does not, by itself, refute the coherency of causality.” This is a bare assertion. I clearly showed in Round 1, as I will repeat now, that only presentism implies a capacity of change. Eternalism, as mentioned before, entails (and is almost synonymous with) four-dimensionalism and the B-series of time. Philosopher and metaphysician John McTaggart argued that only the A-series of time and presentism can allow for genuine change and causation [12][13]. I used relativity of simultaneity to *prove* that eternalism, the B-theory of time, the B-series and four-dimensionalism are likely true. C2) Atemporal Minds For a mind to have ‘eternal’ ideas, there would have to be *time*, for it to even be ‘eternal.’ Eternalism entails impossibility of change, thus all minds are unchanging, and for a mind to be ‘eternal’, it would necessitate the passage of time. Ergo, if I can show that all known minds require processes, then it would be logically coherent to derive that all minds, known or unknown, require processes. Since God is ‘intelligent’, God would have to have the psychological definition of intelligence. Differential psychologist Lloyd Humphreys defines intelligence as “the resultant of the process of acquiring, storing in memory, retrieving, combining, comparing, and using in new contexts information and conceptual skills.” [14] Since intelligence requires a process, if eternalism is true, it is accurate to believe all minds require processes. Thus, the premise is adequately justified. As mentioned, causation requires time. God could say I would cause a storm X, where God is the cause and X is the effect. The ‘thinking’ of it is a process, which requires time to coherently ‘happen’. C3) Law of Parsimony I accept Pro’s interpretation of Occam’s razor, and thus extend the razor from the prior round.

100	S195e5f1a-A90311c78	0	2	Do we need cash?	The Federal Defense of Marriage Act is Unconstitutional	"I thank my opponent for his response and his inspiring conduct in this debate. It has certainly been worth the time. I am glad to see that my opponent and I have reached a mutual understanding of full faith and credit. He has agreed that Congress's power to regulate full faith and credit in this situtation is dependent upon whether their doing so involves the violation of another constitutional clause. By proving that DOMA violates equal protection, I will, in turn, also prove that it violates full faith and credit. My opponent claims that DOMA does not violate equal protection because it does not explicitly prevent or outlaw the federal government or the states from granting the benefits that accompany marriage to other forms of marital unions. To strengthen his case, he provides a hypothetical scenario ""in which Congress immediately adds the same 1,138 protections to a second institution called civil union."" My opponent believes that since such a scenario has the potential to exist, DOMA is not unconstitutional. This argument, while highly interesting, fails on multiple levels. Firstly, my opponent's argument fails from the realistic standpoint. It is not simply enough to analyze whether the wording of a law is unconstitutional, it is also necessary to analyze the real standards of society upon which a law is being applied. Perhaps it is possible that congress creates the institution of civil union and proceeds to give it over 1,000 rights given to marriages, but it is certainly not probable, likely, or even feasible. It is safe to assume that congress has no intention of creating civil unions in the near or long term future, and that it had no such intentions when it created DOMA. The only way to make DOMA constitutional would be to force congress to create the hypothetical situtation created by my opponent. Given the impracticality and near impossibility of forcing congress to do so, it is much more logical not to try and make DOMA constitutional and simply strike it down. For an example of a law that may have seemed constitutional on paper but was obviously not constitutional in practice, one can look to the poll tax. Prior to the passage of the twenty-fourth amendment, the poll tax was constitutional, as upheld in case ""Breedlove v. Suttles"" (1). The poll tax did not seems to explicitly ban any person from voting. However, in practice, the poll tax was clearly designed to discriminate against minorities. This was ended by the supreme court case ""Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections"" (on the grounds of equal protection) and the twenty-fourth amendment (2,3). However, even if we choose to accept my opponent's point (for the sake of argument), it still violates equal protection. My opponent asserts that marriage is merely a construct, a definition. He also stresses the point that not all laws can always treat all people equally. Both of these are true. However, the pertinent question regarding unequal treatment is whether such discriminations and distinctions serve some form of compelling state interest. If we are to construct an institution known as 'marriage', and then we are to reserve it for heterosexual couples, we must find a compelling interest with which to back this reservation of rights. The fact of the matter is that there is no suffieciently compelling interest to stand up to scrutiny or rational review. Therefore, creating a distinction between two nearly identical institutions creates a distinction solely for the purpose of discriminating. In round one, my opponent attempted to offer 'the will of the states' as a compelling state interest. This is not a compelling interest. If my opponent should bring it up again, please look to round two for my rebuttal, which I have already written and my opponent has not acknowledged. The only other argument for compelling interest that I have heard before is that marriage is solely for the purpose of procreation. This argument is illogical. If it was true, it ought not to be legal for infertile people or people who do not desire kids to get married. Moreover, allowing homosexuals to enter the institution of marriage does not hamper or retard the interests of hetersexual procreation. In fact, it increases the ability of homosexuals to adopt and raise kids of their own, which helps raise the next generation of citizens, the primary purpose of procreation. In the event that my opponent brings up this argument (he has not), I have already rebutted it. My opponent may also attempt to bring up the point that marriage is defined as between a man and a woman, and since marriage is a construct, there is not any discrimination there. I have already touched on this above, but just to emphasize another point, I would like to quote Massachussets Supreme Court Justice Greany ""[t]o define the institution of marriage by the characteristics of those to whom it always has been accessible, in order to justify the exclusion of those to whom it never has been accessible, is conclusory and bypasses the core question we are asked to decide."" (4). Essentially, considering homosexual marriage by how it has always been defined is circular and redundant. Also, my opponent has been kind enough to provide a definition of marriage that is agnostic to sexual orientation, so I doubt that he will bring this point up. I would like to thank my opponent once more for accepting this debate. He has put up excellent points, and to be honest, I'm afraid he'll bring up some devastating new point in his final rebuttal, but I won't have time to refute it because he has the last word. Oh well, such is life. I would also like to thank my opponent for his exceptional civilty and conduct. The world would be a much nicer place if everyone was as well-mannered as my opponent. I apologize to my opponent if he is annoyed by my attempts to anticipate his final rebuttal. He may not make the points that I think that he will make at all, but I felt compelled to try and anticipate his points anyway. After all, this is my last chance to make a point. On a personal note, I have always been irked by not having the last say in things. In conclusion, I have demonstrated that DOMA stands in violation of equal rights, and does not stand up to sufficient scrutiny to uphold such violations. It is therefore unconstituional, and it is necessary to vote PRO. Thank you Sources: (1)http://supreme.justia.com... (2)http://en.wikipedia.org... (3)http://en.wikipedia.org...

100	S2b54df17-Ae29fc9ae	0	2	Do we need cash?	Cash for crappy cars	Alright, I'll target one argument this round and his other arguments in Round 2 while responding to any rebuttals. As for now, here are my arguments in favor of the CARS program. But first a brief summary on the topic: CARS stands for Car Allowance Rebate System (Cash for Clunkers). It was pitched a year ago in the New York Times by a well known economist, Alan Blinder. Ever since then, a majority of democrats in the House and Senate have been eating it up. The program had been tried in a few states to improve air quality, and it championed exceptionally small decreases in air pollution.[2] The program was instituted just weeks ago, and Congress has recently approved $2 billion dollars to extend Cash for Clunkers.[7] 240,000 Americans have already traded in their clunkers.[4] I will explain more with my arguments which I will divide into 2 separate parts: 1. Economy - (Market Data [1]) 7/7/09 -- 8/7/09 (8/6/09) Dow 9,093.24 -- 9,382.92 (+236.66, +1.37% from previous day.) NASDAQ 1,746.17 -- 1,999.91 (+26.75, +1.36% from previous day.) S&P 881.03 -- 1,011.39 (+14.31, +1.44% from previous day.) There is no direct correlation between Cash for Clunkers and declines in the stock market. In fact, since July 24th the averages continue on a steady incline, with a few sudden and short lived declines. Cash for Clunkers is meant to increase consumer spending and put money back into the economy. As automotive sales had been at the lowest in years, the cash for clunkers program has increased sales. For example, GM has boasted a 28.7% stock value increase this quarter, and although sales are down 3.1% from this time last year, its an increase from the 11% they were down at the start of this year.[6] And Cash for Clunkers is also an indirect investment in the job security of employees of over 100 companies that rely on GM. These companies and suppliers will go bankrupt along with GM, which alone has around 69,000 U.S. Employees.[8] I haven't found any statistic estimating the jobs at stake, nor can I guess.[3] Keep in mind GM is only one of The Big Three automotive companies. The average mpg increase for the fuel economy is estimated to be 9 mpg, from 15.8 to 25.4 mpg, a 61% increase.[4] The increase is a static analysis and calculated to save 80,000 barrels of oil each day.[7] It will save each driver of these new cars around $580 each year, saving $58 million gallons each year.[5] 2. Environment - Removing older cars from the road will not only reduce fossil fuels being used, but also shows a majority of trucks and SUVs being traded in for passenger cars. If that's not enough to sway any Global Warming fanatics, then how about the estimation that there will be around a 575,000 ton reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, reducing greenhouse gases.[5] [1] http://moneycentral.msn.com...

It is the flow of cash that keeps the economy alive, increasing liquidity and preventing the need for cash injections which spell inflation. If taxation became focused purely on spending, as soon as things looked bleak spending would grind to a halt, and the economy could easily collapse. The last thing we need is a disincentive to spend - especially with a recession likely to be on its way. The opposing argument fundamentally misunderstands the point being made here. It claims that 'the writer is (correctly) pointing out that, all other things being equal, the greater the income tax, the less consumers spend'.

100	S964f11fd-A255e8d00	0	1	Do we need cash?	my opinion	Happiness as we all know is about bonds. It is about the feeling of being wanted; the sense of knowing that you are valued. Money cannot but happiness nor satisfaction, and money can never overvalue the moments of togetherness between couples. Yes in this materialistic world money counts for survival but i think money brings greediness, materialism, and ultimately no time to spend with partners because comes at the cost of time. Those times that one can spend with one's partner is an opportunity cost over money. In addition to this, materialistic life never gets satisfied. suppose a person has latest iphone and he is happy to have it because he feels superior and satisfied but technology changes every now and then. After few years new version of iphone will come in market leading to no satisfaction from the phone he possess at the time. Because of having a materialistic life, he has to work extra hour to earn money to have the latest phone. If one says,people with money do not necessarily need to work; rather they can invest in business to generate profit leading the couples to have quality time. I will say, if the couple does not go through some difficulties together their relationship cannot reap full satisfaction. As i earlier said, a better and happy life is created by sharing and caring for each other. If the couples are rich, they will not get chance to create special respect and love for each other. Emotions, relationship and absolute happiness can never be gained by money. Money is the creation of humans where as emotion is natural and a part of us. therefore, I say that the couple with less money is happier and satisfied.	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	S75f1aae-Ae3325ad	0	2	Do we need cash?	Rematch Debate: God Exists	Thanks Tejretics, I accept the debate.IntroductionAs the burden of proof is shared, all I must do is provide better arguments than Con that pertain to the probability that God exists. In other words, I have no burden of proof to prove that God definitely, inarguably exists, nor that he definitely is omnipotent, omniscient etc... All I must do is provide cogent arguments that conclude that it is probable that God exists, and that it is probable that he is omnipotent, omniscient and so forth.As my opponent is well aware, there are many different arguments for the existence of God. I will choose the one I use based on not just its cogency, but on its ability to assert the probability of God having the attributes he is defined as having in round 1.These are:1. Omnipotence (the ability to do any logically possible action)2. Intelligence (having a sentient mind with complex ideas and a high level of knowledge)3. Transcendence (being outside space and time, although this does not mean that God cannot enter space and time if he so wished, all this means is that he is not essentially bounded by space and time).4. Immense greatness (being comparatively large in a variety of aspects)5. All-seeing (being able to observe all that it is possible to observe)6. Creator of the universe (the cause of the universe's ultimate existence, where the universe is defined as all space, matter, energy and time considered as a whole)I have a shared burden of proof to argue that it is probable that God exists and that it is probable that he has the above attributes.Teleological argumentThis is an argument that uses abductive reasoning, viz. an appeal to best explanation from observation of a given phenomenon. For this argument, I observe the phenomenon of the universe having the exact properties that entail the existence of complex life, and seek to postulate the most probable explanation for this phenomenon.For characters' sake, I will refer to the 'universe having the exact properties to entail complex life' as an 'LPU' (life permitting universe). But note that I am specifically referring to complex life, the likes of mammals, reptiles, birds and so on - including humanity.Observation: The universe is an LPU.This is uncontroversial, we can observe empirically that complex life exists, and hence the universe permits it.From this observation, we have multiple possible abductions we could make:1. The universe is an LPU by chance2. The universe is an LPU because it is necessarily so, viz. it could not have failed to be an LPU3. The universe is an LPU because it was designed to be an LPUThe first two abductions are naturalistic, the last is deistic.Now, we must address the relative probabilities of the three potential explanations.1 - ChanceThis explanation is by far the most improbable. The maximum deviations of any of the main universal constants are as follows:Ratio of Electrons to Protons- 1:10^37Ratio of Electromagnetic Force to Gravity- 1:10^40Expansion Rate of Universe- 1:10^55Mass Density of Universe- 1:10^59Cosmological Constant- 1:10^120(1)If any of these constants deviated by more than their above values, then the universe would either be unable to form stars, be unable to form complex-life-permitting stars (LPS) or be unable to form galaxies. (2)Just to give an idea of the huge improbabilities of even the most flexible of the above constants (1:10^37), I will quote Dr. Hugh Ross, a doctor of Astrophysics:'One part in 10^37 is such an incredibly sensitive balance that it is hard to visualize. The following analogy might help: Cover the entire North American continent in dimes all the way up to the moon, a height of about 239,000 miles (In comparison, the money to pay for the U.S. federal government debt would cover one square mile less than two feet deep with dimes.). Next, pile dimes from here to the moon on a billion other continents the same size as North America. Paint one dime red and mix it into the billions of piles of dimes. Blindfold a friend and ask him to pick out one dime. The odds that he will pick the red dime are one in 10^37' (3)But the probability of the universe being an LPU by chance is even more unlikely than 1 in10^37. If even one of the above constants deviated more than its maximum deviation then the universe would not be an LPU. So, in reality, the probability of the universe having the exact constants is:(1/10^37) x (1/10^40) x (1/10^55) x (1/10^59) x (1/10^120) = 1/10^311Which is an unimaginable tiny number. At this level, the probability is effectively 0.2 - NecessityWhilst this is an explanation that would explain why the universe is an LPU, we can reason that the universe is not necessarily an LPU.This is because, in a modal sense, X is necessarily Y if and only if it is absurd or incoherent to postulate that there is a possible world where X =/= Y.But it is not absurd to postulate a possible world where the universe is not an LPU, so the universe is not necessarily an LPU.3 - DesignCompared to chance and necessity, this abduction is the most reasonable.ConclusionTherefore, via abductive reasoning, the most probable explanation for the phenomenon of the universe being an LPU is that it was designed to be life permitting. Consequently, there must exist a being that is responsible for this design.What do we know about this being? Is it probable that this being is omnipotent, intelligent, transcendent, immensely great, all-seeing and the creator of the universe?'Creator of the universe'What we do know is that this being designed the universe (as this is how His existence is abduced). It is reasonable to postulate that the designer of the universe is also the creator of the universe, as otherwise we need to postulate another God-like being that created the universe using the designs of the God we have already proven. But this contravenes Occams's Razor, since it is a needless postulation of extra entities. So we can conclude that it is probable that if God designed the universe, he also created it.'transcendent'The creator of the universe must not be essentially a part of the universe, otherwise he would be creating himself (which is absurd). Therefore, God must be outside space and time (transcendent).'omnipotence'The creator of the universe must be a being of considerable power, since the universe is so unimaginably large and complex. It is probable that this being is omnipotent, as a lack of omnipotence implies a physical limitation; yet a transcendental God is outside space and time and so cannot be subject to any physical limitation. Therefore it is probable that the creator of the universe is omnipotent.'intelligence'By the same measure, it stands to reason that the designer of our huge, fine-tuned and complex universe would be intelligent, otherwise the designer would not have been able to ensure a state of affairs that allows complex life to exist.'immense greatness'Although the term 'immensely great' is arguably subjective, it is a fair appreciation of the designer and creator of the universe to call this being immensely great.'all-seeing-ness'This property is an implication of being omnipotent, since omnipotence entails the ability to observe everything that God so wishes to see.ConclusionI have used a teleological argument to:1) Prove that a designer of the universe exists2) Assert that it is probable that this designer has the properties ascribed in round 1.3) Identify this existent being as God.Hence I affirm the resolution.

100	S7b4a548-Ab5e7661d	1	2	Do we need cash?	Money can solve anything.	"First and foremost, allow me to address what Pro stated in the previous round. He states that I must provide at least one example of a scenario of an individual that has access to an unlimited supply of cash that will not prevent or solve a problem or disaster. He will attempt to refute any example I give. I will attempt to highlight my argument. Cash is only a medium when cash contains value, for example in American economics we assign dollar amounts to certain denominations of cash. The reason why money has value is because of demand, I want it and my neighbor wants it. I can utilize money for services, goods, and products in return for the money. Now lets examine individual (A). A lives in America, Dallas Texas, and has an infinite supply of money. A wishes to travel to Barcelona Spain, specifically a small town called, La Rinconada. The area is very rural and man farms and farmers. occupy the land. A brings his money of course. A wishes to purchase local food from the farms because he is hungry from his travels, and visit a local onion and cabbage farm. He wants to purchase one hundreds dollars worth of food. The farmer states that, unless he has a service to provide or other goods, such as produce, his money is worthless. This brings me to my first premise, Bartering. Another example I wish to present is the social factor of money. As it pertains to social affairs, social concepts, and models, cash is a profound method of influence and power. However, as it does not pertain to social affairs, and is not limited to social constraints, cash would serve little to no influence. An example to exemplify this is to examine earthly phenomenon such as rogue waves. Rogue waves are waves that are spontaneous and abnormally large. They occur randomly and are extremely arduous to predict and impossible to prevent from occurring. There are areas in the ocean which can be deemed as likely places rogue waves can occur, but can not be prevented. My example of rogue waves is of of many phenomenon, inducing hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, and numerous other events that money can assist in predicting and aiding in recovering from, but can't prevent from happening. All of the above phenomena occurrences have been documented to cause tremendous disaster and present problems to in human life. As I stated above, cash is only used a medium if the cash has value, and cash has no value in a bartering system. The barter system, as Pro would define it, is an actual life system and within actual life events take course. How would money solve anything, in regards to problems, if the means of economics rely on services and/or goods traded for one another? Also mentioned, is my example of naturally occurring phenomenon that money can't prevent. I challenge Pro to refute my examples and defend the notion that, provided an unlimited supply of cash, ""money can solve anything.""

100	Sd9189d5f-A598726ff	0	1	Do we need cash?	The west does not know best	It is likely true that people on the ground sometimes see aid as ‘free money’. But the existence of corruption shows a need for greater accountability and more pressure from donors to ensure that occurs rather than less. Leaving a country because of corruption would simply show unwillingness to tackle one of the major issues that need to be tackled in order to ensure development. Development aid is sometimes spent on implementing schemes that may be the result of a new idea that may not work that becomes a ‘fad’. But to object to this is to object to innovation; new ideas must be tried out on the ground before the development community knows for sure they won’t work. Development thinking is moving towards just handing out cash rather than subsidies; will this work? We don’t know, but won’t know for sure until it is tried more comprehensively than it has been so far.[1] [1] See Helling, Alex, ‘This House would give cash to the poor to reduce poverty’, Debatabase, 24 January 2013	CON	need cash	need cash
100	S2476223e-A5510fb4f	0	2	Do we need cash?	Welfare Should Be Abolished.	"Thank you again for debating this topic with me. My main argument will be that ""Welfare Does More Harm Than Good"" Let's get straight to it! Argument #1 Welfare gets taken advantage of. It's quite obvious that women continue to have children to receive welfare checks. Sadly, these checks get taken advantage of by not using the money for what it's actual purpose is for. If we cut the system entirely, imagine how many women would stop having children. They wouldn't continue having children because then that means they wouldn't be receiving more money. [1] What would happen to the poor if welfare were eliminated? Without the negative incentives created by the welfare state, fewer people would be poor. There would also likely be fewer children born into poverty. Studies suggest that women do make rational decisions about whether to have children, and thus a reduction in welfare benefits would reduce the likelihood of their becoming pregnant or having children out of wedlock. Another problem is that these receivers continuously apply for food stamps, though they don't actually need them. Allot of fraud goes on as well with people applying and selling food stamps to those who aren't on welfare. On February 15,2015 Brushton, New York, 30 people were arrested for eligibly selling food stamps. [2]NY State Police-Malone said via WPTZ that those arrested were using their food stamp cards in a manner that was against the law. All allegedly bought alcohol, received cash, and bought other items food stamp recipients are not allowed to buy using a food stamp card, known as the Electronic Benefits Card (EBT). Police charged all defendants with second degree criminal use of a public benefit card, petit larceny, and misuse of food stamps. Though most were released with an appearance ticket, one defendant was held for parole violations, reports WPTZ. Not only was the system being taken advantage of once more, but imaging how easily kids would be able to get alcohol as well. [3] This type of fraud, called trafficking according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, happens by exchanging food stamps for cash. Trafficking food stamps happens at an extreme “street exchange rate,” which can range anywhere from $.25 to $.50 per dollar, according to WSPA. This means that for every $1 in EBT benefits sold, the recipient gets $.50 to $.75 in cash. According to Addicting Info, the stigma about this type of welfare abuse or food stamp fraud is that it is unusually high because it is so easy to do. Resolution: Instead of providing food stamps, charities could help out tremendously. Many charities are willing to help the needy in any way they can. For instance, there are organizations that cook and provide food to the needy. Why don't we replace providing food stamps, and do it in a much safer way. All food stamp receiving families should be introduced to SNAP. [3] SNAP offers nutrition assistance to millions of eligible, low-income individuals and families and provides economic benefits to communities. SNAP is the largest program in the domestic hunger safety net. The Food and Nutrition Service works with State agencies, nutrition educators, and neighborhood and faith-based organizations to ensure that those eligible for nutrition assistance can make informed decisions about applying for the program and can access benefits. FNS also works with State partners and the retail community to improve program administration and ensure program integrity. So, not only will they be receiving food, they can also learn about how to make healthy choices and presume a healthy lifestyle. This is also a benefit for children growing up who had never been taught about healthy food decisions. Argument #2 [4] It is less efficient than private charity. Private, local charity is true charity: it is voluntary, and it is not subject to the bureaucratic filtering process. I have never heard the government or any of its programs praised for efficiency, except by the government and those who head the programs! There are many willing charities that are eager to help the needy in any way possible. Why not let them? [5] If you need help with paying your rent or bills, including your electric or heating bills, you can look into the following local and national charities and non-profit organizations. A number of other services may be provided by a charity, including free food, housing, basic needs such as clothing, and much more. Various programs and services are offered by charities, as noted below. Unfortunately the resources available from these organizations tends to be limited, and only a certain number of people can be assisted. This is mostly due to the high demand placed on the charities. Much of the aid is focused on people who are most at risk. This can include senior citizens, families with very young children, and the disabled. Even if a charity or non-profit can’t meet your needs, ask them for referrals. Or maybe they have a waiting list that you can sign up for. Just because this is limited doesn't mean it's a bad thing. They will help those who are in most need and are assuredly unable to sustain a proper lifestyle. Many of these systems wouldn't be taken advantage of because people are actually helping you out. They don't just give you money and say ""Here you go, your monthly check, do whatever you please with it"" Nope. These organizations are making sure you use this money wisely and effectively. Some of these organizations include: [4] Community Action Organizations are local public and/or non-profit groups that provide various types of assistance to those in need. They can help with heating and utility bills, provide job training, rent payments, and various other services. Episcopal Church - This is a national organization, but the services run by each local parish vary. The charity supports the vulnerable and families living in poverty. Volunteers can provide basic needs such as personal hygiene items, clothing, hot meals, or food. Some of the parishes of this charity may also have more extensive support, even involving health clinics held by volunteers or loans to use for car repairs. Continue with services from Episcopal Church. Non-profit credit counseling agencies operate in many cities and counties. These organizations will usually charge clients a small fee for their services. However, if your income is low enough, then the debt reduction and other financial services may be offered for free, as a charity type service. Find a listing of free or low cost non-profit credit counseling agencies. Note that these people are actually willing and happy to help those in need.

Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	need cash	need cash

100	S195e5f1a-A9caad815	0	2	Do we need cash?	The Federal Defense of Marriage Act is Unconstitutional	"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. I hope that an interesting debate follows. I also thank my opponent for acknowledging that the criterion for this debate shall be constitutionality. It was wise of him to remind the reader of this. My opponent was also wise to bring up the second half of the full faith and credit clause, which allows congress to ""prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings, shall be proved, and the effect which judgments, obtained in one state, shall have in another."" However, the power of congress is not unlimited. In supreme court case ""Fauntleroy v. Lum"", the Supreme Court has explicitly held that judicial proceedings ""shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from whence the said records are or shall be taken."" (1). This opinion was confirmed by case Yarborough v. Yarborough (2). Section 1 of DOMA states that ""'No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any ...judicial proceeding of any other State..."" (3). This violates the precedents upheld in these cases. However, even if my opponent wishes to deny the value of the Supreme Court's input, it must be noted that Congress is not justified in restricting ""full faith and credit"" if this restriction can lead to a violation of rights. Since Congress's decision to restrict fall faith and credit deals with the rights and equal protections of certain classes, the restriction must stand up to a certain degree of reasonable scrutiny. If it can be proved that any part or ramifications of DOMA result in the restriction of an individuals due process or equal protection, congress's ability to restrict 'full faith and credit' is, in this instance, unconstitutional. My opponent claims that DOMA is not a violation of equal protection. Much of this claim is staked on the idea that DOMA defines marriage as between a man and a woman for the sake of clarification and practicality, rather than for the sake of discrimination. He says that since all other marriage institutions are left to the states, there is not necessarily blatant discrimination, as homosexual marriages can still be legal is a state chooses to legalize it. Even so, because of DOMA, the federal government cannot possibly recognize any marriage that is not between a man and a woman. Even if a state chooses to recognize such a marriage, people in a gay marriage are not elegible for any benefits that come from having the federal government recognize your marriage. A study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that there are at least ""1,138 federal statutory provisions classified to the United States Code in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving benefits, rights, and privileges."" (4). Because of DOMA, members of a gay marriage are not eligible for any of these, and they are being denied equal rights and protections under the law. Homosexuals are also being denied the right to marriage, a right that has existed since Supreme Court case ""Loving v. Virginia"" (5). This is a violation of the substantive Due Process and is also unconstitutional. My opponent also claims that ""This does not violate Equal Protection because DOMA does not deny any person the right to enter into heterosexual marriage."" Prior to ""Loving v. Virginia"", it was possible for the state of Virginia not to recognize any marriage between people of mixed races. According to my opponents logic in the quoted statement, this would not violate equal protection either, as it did not deny anybody the right to enter into a marriage with their own race. The right to marriage found in ""Loving v. Virginia"" changed that. The same logic applies here. My opponent goes on to say that all laws discriminate to some degree. This is true. I didn't say that it was not. However, the important question regarding this discrimination is whether is stands up to at least a reasonable level of scrutiny. It is clear that it is not reasonable to deny homosexuals their 'right to marriage' and over 1000+ benefits that comes with that right (5,4). My opponent says that DOMA does not ""expressly outlaw same-sex marriage"". The key word is ""expressly"". By limiting the definition of 'marriage' to 'one man and one woman', DOMA bans all homosexual marriage on the federal level. My opponent also says ""nor is there any clear design to discourage homosexual relationships."" Here, the key word is ""clear"". Considering that the law denies hundreds of benefits to homosexual couples, it is logical that it will discourage the formation of homosexual couples. DOMA may defer marriage matters to the state, but that it not sufficient to guarantee substantive due process or equal protection. My opponent asserts that Equal Protection cannot come into play for homosexuals because homosexuality is not biological. Firstly, it must be said that there are numerous studies that have proven biological and anatomical differences between hetero and homosexuals. Most notable are differences in Brain structure and size, as well as differences in the hypothalmus gland, which is rather responsible for sexuality. I've listed various sources to confirm this (6). This is also evidence that homosexuality exists in nature. Scientists have discovered that rams tend to be gay. The proportion of gay rams is close to the proportion of gay humans. Gay rams have brain differences similar to the ones found in humans (7). Given the nature of animals, they do not make ""lifestyle choices"". Even if homosexuality is not caused by biological factors, the other reputable theory as to the cause of homosexuality are various pyschological stimuli and trauma at a young age (this theory has less evidence than the biology theory). If this is indeed the cause, then homosexuality is still not a ""lifestyle"" choice (8). The point is, homosexuality is not a voluntary ""lifestyle"" choice. Regardless, equal protection of the law does not end at ""life style choices"". Protected and suspect classes are not required to be biological either. Religion is a protected class. Religion is also a lifestyle choice. Exclusion of homosexuals from equal protection is not justified by ""it's a life style choice"". My opponent's scrutiny rationale is not sufficient. Public opinion or even state opinion is not sufficient case for discrimination under a scrutiny standard. If it was, the Supreme Court would not make any particularly controversial decisions. However, it does so all the time. The aforementioned ""Lawrence v. Texas"" was unpopular, and many states reacted negatively towards it. Another famously unpopular case is ""Texas v. Johnson"", which allows flag-burning although 90% of the populace and nearly every state would like to ban it (9). I would like to take this time to thank my opponent again for agreeing to debate this very interesting topic. I have been enjoying this debate immensly. I would like to apologize for my rushed and chaotic organization towards the end of this rebuttal, but I am running out of space, energy, and daytime. Thank you.

Money cannot give you freedom	"==Introduction== I will argue that people cannot gain freedom from money, and that money in most cases restricts individual freedom. I will use a broad definition of freedom, as described by the Merriam-Webster dictionary [1]: ""the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants."" True freedom must meet all of the criteria in this definition. ==Arguments== Here are my three main arguments: 1. In order to support yourself with money, you would need certain obligations. There are rare exceptions, e.g. people who win the lottery, or inherit large sums of money. But the vast majority of people need to work in order to receive money. Working is an obligation which forces you to preform certain tasks under certain hours, thereby restricting your ""right to act as one wants."" One cannot obtain true freedom while working. 2. Money has no real value, but is merely a symbolic entity. Philosophically, one could say that money has a value because everyone agrees it does. It has an imagined value. This value is unstable, as it changes over time and depends upon other people. A sudden inflation, e.g. what happened in Germany after WW1, would render your money useless. Therefore, money can only give you an imagined freedom, which is highly dependent upon other people. This is not true freedom. 3. As a wealthy person, you are most likely in the ""public eye"" and thus prone to attention. Your actions will be noted by many other people, which is why you are concerned about what you say and how you behave, albeit subconsciously. This limits your ""power to act and speak as one wants."" People who are wealthy to the point of being recognized by society cannot obtain true freedom. ==Sources== http://www.merriam-webster.com..."	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	S2c813efa-A97c94a4	0	1	Do we need cash?	The user known as Danielle used dishonest tactics in her same-sex parenting debate.	"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	Sc6a60b85-Af394b5f3	0	2	Do we need cash?	Secondary Schools should provide cash rewards for student achievement.	"I'd like to sincerely thank my opponent for instigating this debate. This is a topic I feel very strongly about, ever since my former secondary school set up precisely such a system. This is my first debate of 2011, and although the A/R/E format is admittedly foreign to me (and even pro missed out the ""E"" on his second point), I am extremely excited to get in to it.Definitions=========================Achievement: doing significantly well at a high school event, particularly exams (as the main role of high school is education). To ""do significantly well,"" a student should do objectively very well compared to their peers, rather than subjectively (say, compared to past grades, which are relative to the student).Rebuttals=========================Encourages responsible financial managementWe're dealing with teenagers here. Many teenagers already do work for money (evidence: your nearest McDonald's or supermarket should have at least one). Schools don't just randomly hand out wads of cash to students, but high schoolers want cash, so they work. In the tight global job market, however, not all teenagers find work. How do businesses decide which teenagers to hire? They look to the only thing young people have to show for themselves: their school achievements. Sometimes a few extra-curricular activities get a look in, but let me assure you that every employer will choose a smart, talented kid over a lazy, stupid kid. In other words, the smart kids are already learning how to manage their money responsibly under the status quo. They're earning it, and they're spending it. Giving them more money won't teach them anything. It's the lazy, stupid kids that don't ""work with cash"" and thus need to be taught fiscal responsibility. If you've got some money to invest, use it to help the struggling kids achieve, not to fund those kids who can already fund themselves.Will increase AttendanceThe reason why my opponent has no evidence for this is that it doesn't. The talented kids usually attend school anyway, so they don't need any extra incentive. The kids without talent will have no extra incentive to attend as they won't be getting the rewards. Teenage kids are not going to be motivated, however, by the thought of rewards they have no hope of receiving. If anything, it will demotivate them that they have no hope of reaping the immediate fruits of their learning - no direct incentive is tied to attendance. Just in case my opponent was thinking of saying that the untalented kids can catch up, just imagine the alternative if you're somebody who isn't very clever: either go to school for four years and hope that you'll beat the kids who have always been smarter than you, or go to your girl/boyfriend's party tomorrow. For most young people the choice is clear.Constructive=========================A: Will affect scholarship eligibilityR: Many universities and corporations offer hardship grants and scholarships (or similar) for students who don't have lots of money but who show promise. Having to declare all these extra school awards will make students less eligible than students from schools which don't have such awards. The harm is not that the students won't attend university (they will) or that they won't be able to afford it now (that's what the cash rewards are for) but that a university scholarship is far more prestigious than a high school award. If students who are more capable and no better off are missing out on these prizes, they are also missing out on future employment opportunities, income and lifestyle - all because their parents sent them to the wrong high school! That's not fair.E: Ever since my former high school began the system, not one of their school leavers has won a university scholarship, despite the fact that they used to win several every year. This is particularly pernicious in this case as the school is almost entirely filled with students from very disadvantaged backgrounds, but even among more wealthy schools, a university will favor a smart kid with no money over a smart kid who's been earning a few thousand from their high school.A: Wrong RewardR: Over here teenagers like to spend money on parties, but if going to the candy bar is what's cool in America right now, I'll run with that. If my opponent's model is instigated, the only real effect you'll see is the share price of Hershey's doubling and student parties sharply increasing, as taxpayer money is redirected to these entirely unproductive pursuits. Rewarding students with book vouchers or similar will provide positive reinforcement, and further encourage their desire to learn. Rewarding students with more candy will give them an excuse to miss class and discourage their desire to learn. Rather than handing out bucket loads of coins to the best of the best (assuming taxpayers are okay with that, and that the health harms of partying all night and eating delicious candy are neglible), why not hand out something that will serve them well for life? That's what school's for, after all.E: Teenagers under the status quo often get their money from work, but clearly are not so emotionally attached to it to not go to the candy bar (as my opponent concedes students often do).I don't really want to over-complicate this debate as I feel it's a really simple issue, so I'll stop there. I say education has become far too much about the top 1% of students. It's time for the non-achieving 99% of students to get some help. Giving the 1% more money won't actually help them at all. At the very least, using the money to teach them a lesson would be a much better reward. But how can anyone disagree that it's the 99% at the bottom who need help the most?The motion falls."

100	S3141f83f-A6b993f03	1	1	Do we need cash?	It is wrong to assume that the individual always knows best	With subsidies at least the government knows what their money is being spent on. This is not the case with cash; it just gets taken and can be spent on anything. As already mentioned the most obvious examples are where the individual uses the money they are given on drugs or other harmful products not what they need. Yet there are times where individuals may simply not have their own best interests at heart for various reasons, particularly because they know no better. This does not just happen in economic situations but also in public heath. For example development agencies know that cooking on open fires in homes leads to thousands of deaths every year and is costly in terms of fuel. So thousands of clean smokeless stoves have been given out yet they are not being used despite them being cheaper to run and potentially a life saver.[1] [1] Duflo, Esther, et al., ‘Up in Smoke: The Influence of Household Behavior on the Long-Run Impact of Improved Cooking Stoves’, MIT Department of Economics Working Paper, No.12-10, 16 April 2012	PRO	need cash	need cash

When a starving man on the stree finds a hundred dollar bill he smiles with the joy and fantasy of what he will buy and how long he'll try and make it last. Let me list some of the happinesses that come from posessing money: (1) The posession of money in itself, even before one buys anything with it, relieves stress. For example, most couples arguments are about money. When struggling to pay bills, spouses tend to be more sensitive, and even trivial things (like a bit too much salt in the food) are enough to set an already on edge couple into an argument where being late on the mortgage might well come up. There is relaxation, peace of mind, that comes from being able to pay your bills (just the ""ability"") to pay them alone, knowing you don't have to worry about money. (2) Money creates financial oppotunities. When we have lots of money we are quick to invest in different things. Just think of how much a happy camper I'll be in just a few years when my investment pays off? Just thinking about my coming finacial security, being able to do what I want, when I want, brings joy. Money gives us opportunities and freedom of action. That freedom, the ""ability"" (just knowing) we can do X or Y if we so desire is a source of comfort, and joy, and peace of mind. (3) Money creates moments. Just think of the poeple dying in hospital because they can't afford certain operations. Now tell them you will donate the money right away, and tell me they won't be happy to hear that news. If you give them the money, the mere ""posession"" of that money will make them happy ""because"" of what they will do with it. Stress and fear of death will be releived from them because of the security that money promises. A man in fear of death or debt ceases to be afraid when he has the needed money, even before he actually cures the illness or clears he debt. There is an intesne emotional response that comes from posession of money because of its value and what can be achieved with it in this world. I never said that I don't believe in saints, but I called it ""saints"" nonsense in the context of this debate to mean that it is rediculous to think that happiness comes from serving God alone and nothing else. I'm also saying that it's very hypocritical of ""saints"" who argue that money can't bring happiness they themselves in many cases lavish in the luxery of money and what it can afford. In fact, my challenge to these ""saints"" who so argue, is to give up ""all"" their money and see if they will remain as overjoyed and optimistic as they are now. It's an easy philosophy to preach, but a hard one to live by. ""And about the argument about happiness in married life. Pro says a wife gets a letter from husband that he is coming home and she feels happy. Please notice here that the neither the paper nor the ink is giving her happiness. It is the message and the relationship between her and the husband which is giving happiness."" How sly of my opponent, that's like saying that its not the paper and ink of money that makes one happy, but the value of the money, the things one can (and plan to) do with it, that bring happiness. Fact is, if she didn't posess the note itself she would not have been happy; it was what he wrote with that ink that made her happy, so let's stop playing with words. The money sends just as much messages to her as the paper and ink in her husband's letter. The money too, has a relationship with her, it is her companion and protector, it goes with her in her purse to work each day, it pays her bills and protects her home, and it crys out to her ""cherish and protect me as I do for you."" Money makes her happy just the same as her husband's letters do. Interestingly, the husband isn't home yet, but posessing his letter cause the very thought of his arrival to pop into her mind which brought joy; so too, she didn't have to spend the money yet, but posessing it also makes her think positively about what her future holds, and in this way it brings happiness. We all need diffrent amounts of money to be happy. For some its lots, for others its little. The ones in India Con mentions clearly only need little. But are the majority of them really happy? I don't think so. Many of them are fleeing India in search of happiness and a better life in the more developed countries. ""talking about unhappiness in poverty, it is due to laws of nature that brings them unhappiness and nature does not provide them the basic needs. it is something called as ""karma"" if you have heard of it. all these laws are ultimately comtrolled by God Himself."" Karma? Well this is not a deate about the validity of any particular religious belief, but I certainly see no proof of karma in the world. Poverty causes unhappiness, true or false? Marriages fails or many reasons, but one of them is problems over how to spend money when they only have little. If they had enough money, this is one of the many hazards to a healthy marriage they could easily avoid without having to ""pay"" Dr. Phil; bickering over money. ""talking about getting a billion dollars myself, Pro said i would have a grin from ear to ear. Yes, I may have but my ultimate happiness depends on how i use it, whether in service of God or selfishly."" Con, is there a difference between happiness, and ""ultimate"" happiness? Please dont' play with words now, just tell us what you mean. Even if we reason that giving a million dollars to the poor (how you use it) is what makes you happy, the thing is, receiving the money makes them happy, and even before you gave it, the very prospect of being able to give it makes you happy to. So money brings happiness because of what you can do with it, because of its value. A philantrophist sleeps well at night because of the security his money can bring him and others. ""The most happiest country is statistically proved to be Bangladesh, though the country is very small and not a developed country,"" Please give us the statistics to back this up Con. Please cite your source for this information before we disregard this as a mere claim. Since we are on a request for ""data,"" let me provide a study for you. It has been statistically proven that ""Economic freedom correlates strongly with happiness."" (In Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?The Cato institute. April 11, 2007 http://www.cato.org...) ""On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations."" http://en.wikipedia.org... Interesting how Con argues about the moments before death how money can bring happiness. Tell that to the sick people who need that money for medication or operations to save their lives. Even if they will take a year to get the treatment, the mere fact they have the money to afford it will bring them greater joy and less stress for that year.

This is clear: treating equivalent things differently means basing one's treatment of the things not on any of their actual qualities, but rather on nothing, for no qualities are different between the things so as to give rise to a basis for these different treatments. If, then, one thing is judged as bad, then all equivalent things are equally bad. I must, then, show that all Abrahamic religions are equivalent in every way. This is incredibly easy to do and takes little time. The concept of any God is a contradiction in terms, for omnipotence and infinite power in general cannot be defined; the infinite cannot be grasped by the finite, for, to grasp the nature of the infinite, one must be able to transcend it and look at it in its totality, which requires an escape from the grasp of the infinite. Any professed knowledge of the infinite must, then, be nonsense. The proposition ""An omnipotent God exists,"" then, is impossible to uphold. All tenets of Abrahamic religions follow from God. If their common basis is irrational, so too must everything which follows from it. For it does not matter how true a conclusion is if its justification is nonsense; a conclusion is only meaningful if it is tied to reality at its root. Sense: 1. All men are mortal 2. Socrates is a man C. Socrates is mortal Nonsense: 1. All ducks are red 2. Socrates is dead, and we have killed him C. Socrates is mortal The conclusions of both rely on and are inexorably linked to their premises, and it can hardly be said that they both hold the same relation to reality. For when a conclusion is spoken, all prior groundwork is implied. If everything which follows from the premiss of an omnipotent God is nonsense, and if all Abrahamic religions follow from the premiss of an omnipotent God, all Abrahamic religions must be nonsense. What is nonsense? Nonsense is that which has no sense, sense being what a proposition pictures. If, then, a nonsensical proposition pictures nothing, it cannot be distinguishable from other nonsensical propositions. Nonsense is simply the lack of sense; there are no other qualities which can be ascribed to it, for, if there were, the nonsense would be sense. Therefore, all propositions of nonsense are equally empty and have no differences except in arbitrary linguistic form. If the totality of Abrahamic religions is, then, nonsense, then they must all be judged equally; there is nothing which sets any individual nonsensical proposition apart from the others. Ergo, all are equally bad. Q.E.D."	PRO	need cash	need cash

Marijuana should be legalized	"I welcome my opponent to Debate.org.Marijuana: the dried leaves and female flowers of the hemp plant, used in cigarette form as a narcotic or hallucinogen.http://dictionary.reference.com...For brevity, I will be referring to Marijuana throughout this debate as M. Your points A1 and A2 are identical; I will be treating them together.""A1- Marijuana has many health Benefitsit has many health benefits it know that it can take away cancer cant take away pain""and""A-2 IF used correctly it can help in the treatmentIf managed correctly is can help over 14 diseases such as Cancer and Alzheimer;s, appetite loss, glaucoma, nausea, vomiting, spasticity, pain, weight loss, arthritis, dystonia, insomnia, seizures, and tourette's syndrome""My opponent claims M has health benefits. He then attempts to outline some of them: ""it has many health benefits it know that it can take away cancer cant take away pain""Whether he means that he knows it can take away cancer (""take away"" also termed ""cure,"" in less educated circles than my worthy opponent) but cannot reduce pain, is an open question; the English language apparently is too restrictive for the concepts my opponent is trying to convey. I am frankly in the dark as to his actual intent here; hopefully he can enlighten us next round.He then lists off fourteen conditions for which he believes M to be an effective treatment. He calls these diseases, although there are only two actual diseases on his list; the rest are symptoms of many disorders. He gives no source for his claims, no reasoning; it is his unornamented opinion, and will be treated as such for this... *ahem* debate.I hope that my opponent will favor us with a few actual arguments to back up his position in his next round; a reliable source or two to establish these claims wouldn't hurt his case, either.M by itself is rather suspect as a treatment. M poses very serious long and short term health risks to the user, as documented here: http://drugabuse.gov... Short term effects of M use include: ""distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty with thinking and problemsolving, and problems with learning and memory."" Long term effects include ""anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia."" The site goes on to note: ""marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke,""and ""marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.""Depression, schizophrenia, lung and mouth cancer, heart disease; these seem like potent health reasons to avoid M, not to use it. Note that M has been noted to cause some of the same ailments my opponent claimed it would cure - I mean, ""take away."" Although certain compounds isolated in M can potentially have medical applications, such as dronabinol and nabilone, that is a completely different subject from legalizing M. M is primary used for recreational purposes; people usually smoke it to get high, not get better. If my opponent wanted to argue the medical side of this, he should have called for the legal use in drug form of certain chemical compounds found in M leaves; as it is, the recreation use of this drug is illegal, and it is up to my opponent to show why it should not be. Medical uses are not cogent to your case. A-3 ""Alcohol used to be Illegal and they voted and it is now legal why not legalize marijuana and alcohol has a more dealth tole then Marijuana there were 22,072 related deaths in 2006 for alcohol related. 13,050 more deaths came from alcoholic liver disease. To this day there has not been any recorded credible deaths caused by the effects of marijuana""M is illegal for the same reason prostitution and littering and graffiti are illegal; it promotes crime, presents a public health risk, and is a public nuisance. 1. M promotes crime by being a gateway drug; the smaller, less-addictive highs from M lead many users to experiment with stronger drugs which are MUCH more addictive, and which must be obtained at high prices from the black market. Petty crime to pay for the addictive substances and felonies committed by dealers and their organizations over the supply of the same are fueled by these new addicts. 2. M is a public health risk, not just in the second-hand carcinogen laden smoke, but in the users who venture into our streets and workplaces under the effects of this drug. M causes ""distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty with thinking and problemsolving, and problems with learning and memory,"" all of which puts other people at risk when MJ users drive or operate machinery. It is similar to the distorting and dulling effects of alcohol, except there are cases of the dulling effects of M lasting for days or weeks after the exposure. When driving, those who are under the influence of M are as much a risk as those who drink, and the effects last longer. 3. M is a public nuisance. Any society depends on having sane, awake people taking care of their everyday business; any substance that creates a class of stoned, brain-dead zombies is harmful to the success and possibly the survival of that society. Hippies are termed the dregs of society for a reason; they contribute nothing of value, and function as sand in the gears of civilization. Tobacco, as harmful to one's health as it is, at least does not prevent one from thinking; alcohol's effects wear off with the hangover. M's effects can impair one's ""physical and mental health, cognitive abilities, social life, and career status. Several studies associate workers' marijuana smoking with increased absences, tardiness, accidents, workers' compensation claims, and job turnover.""Hard liquor and tobacco should probably be made illegal for their health risks, but that fact that they aren't illegal is no argument in favor of legalizing M. Just because unions are allowed to make enormous ""campaign contributions"" to candidates so that they will champion their causes does not mean that simple bribery should be permitted. If anything, the fact that the one harmful practice is permitted while another is banned means that we aren't done banning harmful things.I've put enough time into this round.

The whole point of the system is that it is flexible rather than limiting in the way other subsidy systems are. It should be considered that while some may misspend their money as suggested on drugs others may find ways of investing it so that they make more money and pull themselves out of poverty which then saves the government in the long term.

It's not their responsibility to focus on being the most moral and generous company, because all companies need to make money, so it is the responsibility of the government to raise the minimum wage to 10-15 dollars an hour.

100	S49eee388-A76b890c0	0	1	Do we need cash?	The United States National Debt is the Amount of Money the United States has Created not Borrowed	"Thanks for the solid debate... This is a very confusing subject and my wording may not always be perfect, but my opponent is taking this conversation to a place that I did not want it to go. The money supply, whatever you want to call it, Monetary Base, M1, M2, M3, should not be used in this debate. We are talking about Government created money, M2 uses all deposits in banks including loans. Loans are not created from Government spending, loans are created by banks. So anyone reading this debate should disregard any attempts by the opponent to correlate M2 money supply with the National Debt. ==Should we exclude intragovernmental debt from debt measurements?== My opponent is misinterpreting the accounting involved that represents our nations debt. Intragovernmental debt is simply a number that records how much surplus the Govt has taken from it's Govt programs + interest paid on the pieces of paper they give themselves. If one understands accounting they can see where I am coming from in saying that intragovernmental does not add to net spending, it adds to net debt by way of accounting. Here is a simple example of what is going on with intragovernmental debt. The Govt taxes $1000 for Social Security The Govt pays $800 for Social Security The Govt now has a surplus of $200. In accounting terms the Govt has debited $200 from the nonbank publics accounts. The Govt then invests that $200 in themselves. In return they give themselves a piece of paper that says we owe this $200 + interest back. Now those of you who can think outside the box, what is really going on here? The Govt is giving themselves the $200 to spend and replacing it with a piece of paper. There is no ""new"" money created in this process... only debt. Clinton used this process (which is mandated by law) to reduce the public portion of the debt. But all he did was replace public debt with intragovernmental debt, which is why the overall debt did not decrease. So the money is still backed by debt, just a new form of debt. And when the intragovernmental debt get's ""paid off"" it will simply be converted back to public debt. So I therefore maintain my assertion that the Government still creates money through deficit spending and that your tax dollars can not be used to pay off the National Debt. My opponent is using a situation in which debt was used to replace debt, but he is focusing on just one side of the equation. Let me go through some points my opponent made and go through my refutation. 1) My opponent says ""Say what you want about the money supply, but if you believe that all cash is created by debt, you CANNOT believe that there would ever be more money in circulation than debt."" ---------------------------------------------- My opponent is simply missing a HUGE piece of the puzzle. Bank loans are created by banks. And banks can create a lot more loans then there is money created by the Govt. In accounting terms bank loans are a wash and they are not even relevant to this discussion on Govt debt. So if you understand fractional reserve banking, you can understand how there can be more money in the money supply then there is debt (which the reserves are included in). What I like to say is that banks leverage Government money... but the Govt has to spend more money in order for the banks to be able to leverage more. ---------------------------------------------- 2) This is very important for those reading this debate to make sure you understand. My opponent erroneously says ""First, how does $11 billion of gold at current value (what the Fed lists on their website) turn into $473 billion in value. I think my opponent changed $11 billion in gold to 11 billion ounces of gold, which is not what the source says. When a bank owns an asset (whether gold or a house), it lists the value of the assets under assets."" ---------------------------------------------- The Federal Reserve does not count gold at it's current value, it counts it's value that it last represented which is $42.22 an ounce. I simply did simple math and said ($11 billion/$42.22 * $1600) just for an estimate on today's value. Here is the Fed's explanation for this number ""Gold stock is valued at $42.22 per fine troy ounce. "" Source: http://www.federalreserve.gov... ----------------------------------------------- 3) My opponent continues to focus on individuals like you and I, which is the most common mistake when trying to think about what is going on behind the scenes. My opponent says ""Remember, the resolution says that when the government issues debt, it creates money. My opponent's own source said that QE2 bought Treasuries but failed to increase liquidity, meaning banks did not lend out any more money, so this failed to ""create"" money."" ----------------------------------------------- The resolution did not say that the National Debt is the amount of money the nonbank public has, I said it creates money. In the case of the Fed's QE2 policy, they purchased treasury's that were already purchased. The money in this instance is actually called a ""reserve"". Banks can not lend these reserves but they can exchange them like they are money, with each other or for more securities. However they can leverage these reserves to create new loans. But in order for the Fed to do QE or Open Market Operations the Government first must deficit spend and create the debt/money before these operations can take place. Everything stems from Government deficit spending. ---------- 4) My opponent continues to fail to grasp the concept of a bank being the intermediary between Government borrowing and Government spending. He says ""How does the government credit $1 trillion to the public"" ---------- Think about it. When the Treasury auctions off debt and a bank (Primary Dealer) purchases it with bank money. The Treasury gets this money in their account at the Fed, in return the Primary Dealer gets a treasury as an assets and has a TTL Note Account as a liability. The Treasury then uses this money to credit bank accounts. If they need to pay for the Iraq war, they go and borrow money from the banks, and then credit nonbank public military bank accounts. My opponent, like many in this subject is still caught up in the fact that the majority of money purchasing Govt debt does not exist just like when you go to get a mortgage from a house. That is a loan. Then, we the nonbank public, go out to Wal Mart or whatever, buy their products, they ship that money overseas to China and what do you know, China purchases $1 trillion in US debt. The fact is that the money has to be spent in to existence first (on a macro basis) before there can be money that exists to purchase the debt. -------------- I have given my opponent numerous articles detailing how Primary Dealers finance their security purchasing and how this creates money in the nonbank public before any debits have occurred from the nonbank public. Sources: http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com... http://research.stlouisfed.org... http://69.175.2.130/~finman/Orlando/Papers/Treasury_dealers_manage_positions.pdf My opponent is simply using the lack of knowledge on the subject and accusing me of red-herrings with out being able to explain factually what I am wrong about. What money do you think the banks are using Contender? My opponent continues to talk about Clinton surpluses. I have shown mathematically how this did not reduce the national debt. It replaced public debt with intragovernmental debt. Mathematically and account-wise you can not pay off intragovernmental debt with out incurring public debt. I do not have enough space to show the accounting, but I will in the next response. Readers, please be aware that my opponent is not using any accounting or math in his rebuttal on my claim."

100	S49eee388-Ad0e6913d	0	1	Do we need cash?	The United States National Debt is the Amount of Money the United States has Created not Borrowed	"==Burden of proof== Best case, my opponent proves that government debt equals the amount of money created, but he fails to prove that it is NOT money borrowed. He must prove both to win. If we don't owe the money to anyone, why would S&P downgrade our debt? Why would anyone worry we wouldn't pay them back if we're not ""borrowing"" as the resolution says. Absurd propositions require higher burdens of proof. ==M2== M2 does not include loans, just savings accounts and checking accounts. I cited a source for this already. ==Clinton== Another red herring from my opponent. Just because Clinton didn't cut spending to pay off debt with actual dollars, doesn't mean we COULDN'T do so. If we cut all military spending ($800 billion a year), we could obviously start paying off the national debt. I said as much in the previous round, but he keeps harping on Clinton as a distraction. ==The government credits our bank accounts== My opponent says the government borrows money then credits military bank accounts, assuming that every borrowed dollar ultimately ends up in the pocket of a US government employee. This is just entirely false. Where does government money go to service the debt? Into the Chinese government coffers, among others, proving that we do owe the money to someone and we did ""borrow"" it. ==Back to burden of proof== This has been a useless debate. My opponent essentially wanted to debate a truism, that when the government creates money on paper, it creates money on paper. I thought he wanted to debate his ""perfect"" analogy, that government debt is now like the gold standard: that it is solely responsible for creating money. Vote against him on conduct for morphing the debate. Since he can't prove that we're also not borrowing, he automatically loses. Dropped Voters. Vote Con if you agree that: 3) You believe the government can pay off its debt whenever it chooses to, without shrinking the amount of money in circulation. 4) You believe that Treasuries are sold for cash at the END POINT. Cash is traded for Treasuries, ultimately, and we use that cash to deficit spend (example, China buying our debt). 6) You believe that the Fed doesn't even need to issue debt to print money. It could just use a printing press, which is the whole point of the floating currency. The government can OBVIOUSLY create money without issuing debt. My opponent says that I have done no math in my rebuttal; I admire his accounting abilities, but debate is about logic, not math (especially when the math triple counts everything, which he concedes). No matter what, we can both think of US government debt as money created on a balance sheet (one descriptively accurate way of representing the debt, using archaic accounting jargon) OR as money that is borrowed. Both are equally valid ways of thinking. If the latter is not valid, we're all really silly to worry about countries like Greece not paying off their debt and about the US debt downgrade, since we don't actually owe money to anyone. It's a really FUN way to debate for my opponent to pick apart the points I make that he can disprove, like Clinton, and completely ignore the major issues in the debate, like the ability of the government to pay down debt if it wants to.

But if there was no money (such as in the case of communism) the lack of it, wouldn't adversely affect anyone. All the fears you refer to only exist because we need 'money' to buy stuff but if there was no money and resources were distributed freely and equally there would be no need for petty cash or even less liquid monetary equivalents. No-one is free of evil/desires, your argument is just as crudely sufficient as saying 'lying isn't bad because everyone has done it at some point'. The fact that we sin and/or are tempted to, doesn't not make it right/good.	CON	need cash	need cash
100	S29994000-Ac8afd106	0	2	Do we need cash?	food stamps are right for those who r not lazy and are the poorest among us	"Thank you. I will include rebuttals in the final round. Food stamps fall under the category of ""Welfare"". I will be arguing the Wlfare, including stamps is a bad idea. I have made this argument before on my Lee001 account. Thank you again for debating this topic with me. My main argument will be that ""Welfare Does More Harm Than Good"" Let's get straight to it! Argument #1 Welfare gets taken advantage of. It's quite obvious that women continue to have children to receive welfare checks. Sadly, these checks get taken advantage of by not using the money for what it's actual purpose is for. If we cut the system entirely, imagine how many women would stop having children. They wouldn't continue having children because then that means they wouldn't be receiving more money. [1] What would happen to the poor if welfare were eliminated? Without the negative incentives created by the welfare state, fewer people would be poor. There would also likely be fewer children born into poverty. Studies suggest that women do make rational decisions about whether to have children, and thus a reduction in welfare benefits would reduce the likelihood of their becoming pregnant or having children out of wedlock. Another problem is that these receivers continuously apply for food stamps, though they don't actually need them. Allot of fraud goes on as well with people applying and selling food stamps to those who aren't on welfare. On February 15,2015 Brushton, New York, 30 people were arrested for eligibly selling food stamps. [2]NY State Police-Malone said via WPTZ that those arrested were using theirfood stamp cardsin a manner that was against the law. All allegedly bought alcohol, received cash, and bought other items food stamp recipients are not allowed to buy using a food stamp card, known as the Electronic Benefits Card (EBT). Police charged all defendants with second degree criminal use of a public benefit card, petit larceny, and misuse of food stamps. Though most were released with an appearance ticket, one defendant was held for parole violations, reports WPTZ. Not only was the system being taken advantage of once more, but imaging how easily kids would be able to get alcohol as well. [3] This type of fraud,called trafficking according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, happens by exchanging food stamps for cash. Traffickingfood stamps happens at an extreme “street exchange rate,” which can range anywhere from $.25 to $.50 per dollar, according to WSPA. This means that for every $1 in EBT benefits sold, the recipient gets $.50 to $.75 in cash. According toAddicting Info, the stigma about this type ofwelfare abuseor food stamp fraud is that it is unusually high because it is so easy to do. Resolution: Instead of providing food stamps, charities could help out tremendously. Many charities are willing to help the needy in any way they can. For instance, there are organizations that cook and provide food to the needy. Why don't we replace providing food stamps, and do it in a much safer way. All food stamp receiving families should be introduced to SNAP. [3] SNAP offers nutrition assistance to millions of eligible, low-income individuals and families and provides economic benefits to communities. SNAP is the largest program in the domestic hunger safety net. The Food and Nutrition Service works with State agencies, nutrition educators, and neighborhood and faith-based organizations to ensure that those eligible for nutrition assistance can make informed decisions about applying for the program and can access benefits. FNS also works with State partners and the retail community to improve program administration and ensure program integrity. So, not only will they be receiving food, they can also learn about how to make healthy choices and presume a healthy lifestyle. This is also a benefit for children growing up who had never been taught about healthy food decisions. Argument #2 [4] It is less efficient than private charity. Private, local charity is true charity: it is voluntary, and it is not subject to the bureaucratic filtering process. I have never heard the government or any of its programs praised for efficiency, except by the government and those who head the programs! There are many willing charities that are eager to help the needy in any way possible. Why not let them? [5] If you need help with paying your rent or bills, including your electric or heating bills, you can look into the following local and national charities and non-profit organizations. A number of other services may be provided by a charity, including free food, housing, basic needs such as clothing, and much more. Various programs and services are offered by charities, as noted below. Unfortunately the resources available from these organizations tends to be limited, and only a certain number of people can be assisted. This is mostly due to the high demand placed on the charities. Much of the aid is focused on people who are most at risk. This can include senior citizens, families with very young children, and the disabled. Even if a charity or non-profit can’t meet your needs, ask them for referrals. Or maybe they have a waiting list that you can sign up for. Just because this is limited doesn't mean it's a bad thing. They will help those who are in most need and are assuredly unable to sustain a proper lifestyle. Many of these systems wouldn't be taken advantage of because people are actually helping you out. They don't just give you money and say ""Here you go, your monthly check, do whatever you please with it"" Nope. These organizations are making sure you use this money wisely and effectively. Some of these organizations include: [4] Community Action Organizations are local public and/or non-profit groups that provide various types of assistance to those in need. They can help with heating and utility bills, provide job training, rent payments, and various other services. Episcopal Church - This is a national organization, but the services run by each local parish vary. The charity supports the vulnerable and families living in poverty. Volunteers can provide basic needs such as personal hygiene items, clothing, hot meals, or food. Some of the parishes of this charity may also have more extensive support, even involving health clinics held by volunteers or loans to use for car repairs. Continue with services from Episcopal Church. Non-profit credit counseling agencies operate in many cities and counties. These organizations will usually charge clients a small fee for their services. However, if your income is low enough, then the debt reduction and other financial services may be offered for free, as a charity type service. Find a listing of free or low cost non-profit credit counseling agencies. Note that these people are actually willing and happy to help those in need.

100	Sbc6467-Aa113409c	0	2	Do we need cash?	Solar Electic Power	"The DealSuppose you are an American homeowner living in a house worth $153,000. You now spend $1403 a year on electricity. Pro has a deal for you. Consider it carefully. First save up $90,283, then buy and install a rooftop solar electric power system for your home. The system will require $410 a year for extra insurance, you'll have to clean off the snow whenever it snows and take care of the batteries needed to run at night, and your real real estate taxes will go up. Your solar electric system will last 25 years, providing all the electricity you need for those 25 years. Then you'll need to replace it using new saved cash. Are you ready to sign up for that deal? I think it's not plausible, but if you're not sure, then the controversy over the exact costs and risks follow. I think the average homeowner would be ready for the exit right after the ""save up $90,283"" part. People aspire to pay off their mortgage, buy a better house, and put their kids through college, not become their own a mini electric utility. But that's just my opinion. Areas of Agreement We have agreed to important facts relevant to the debate, including the numbers cited above. We agreed to how much power is consumed by the average homeowner and what it now costs. I don't think there's anything controversial there. To carefully evaluate the investment, we agreed that money not spent on solar, the $90,283, could be put into a long term investment earning 4.3% interest. To limit the scope of the debate, I agreed to electric utility costs rising at 4.6% per year including, although logically rates ought to drop due to advancing technology. (Oil isn't used significantly for power generation.) More doubtful, we agreed to use an inflation rate of 2.5% for the 25 year period. The real estate tax rate is agreed to start at $10 per $1000 of assessed value. Maintenance, taxes, and insurance all increase at the inflation rate. We agreed not to count government subsidies for solar electric. The obvious subsidies are government tax rebates. The debate is about the real economics. We needed numbers to evaluate the solar electric investment, but their is risk in all the numbers. No one really knows what will happen to electric rates, taxes, or inflation. That's inherent in investment decisions. There are many risks to consider as part of this debate, and they count in assessing the viability of the solar alternative. The do-it-yourself option Installation and maintenance costs are significant. Pro offers the option of the homeowner doing his own installation and counting the homeowners labor as having no cost. It's like saying that you could either pay to take a ferry across the river to work, or you could build your own boat and use that. In the latter case only the cost of the wood for the boat should count. Pro says the minimum solar equipment cost is $44,283. I say it is more because he has underestimated the battery storage and that the part to tying into the house electrical system requires a professional electrician to meet code requirements. The do-it-yourself requirement is not an apples-and-apples comparison, so it shouldn't be part of the debate at all. If we were going to compare the cost of washing clothes at the laundromat versus using a washing machine at home, w wouldn't consider the option of building your own washing machine. For solar, or whatever else, we are comparing one ready solution to another ready solution. I pointed out that assuming free infinite labor makes many uneconomic projects appear economic even though they are not. There are many reason why a homeowner could not use the do-it-yourself alternative. Physical limitations may prevent roof work or limited skills might risk successful completion. The homeowner might not have the free time. The debate is about whether solar is a practical alternative, and the do-it-yourself option is not practical for many homeowners. I also also questioned if homeowner labor couldn't be better spent on more valuable work. The premise of the debate is that homeowner is able to save a lot of free cash, Pro says at least $44,000 for the equipment. That implies a very good job, not a typical household income of $50,000. I argue that our lawyer-living-in-a-$153K-home will be better of doing the work he qualified to do rather than playing solar pioneer. Pro rebuts that, no, it's just a salaried guy who has the time and no other work option. The problem is the unrealistic root assumption of having a large bundle of ready cash. The most realistic way to resolve that is to suppose the money is borrowed, but that blows up the cost of the solar electric system with high interest expenses. Borrowing $44K would have over $4K in yearly interest compared to the $1403 electric bill. That's out, and we are left assuming a very well paid homeowner. Maintenance costs Pro's plan is to use neighborhood kids to clean snow off the roof and other maintenance. I said you need some sort of a business to do that. Pro rebutted that the skills are minimal. Pro missed my point, which as not at all about skills, it was about liability insurance. I challenged Pro to include the cost of insuring an unlicensed neighborhood kid to work on a roof. I said I don't think it's possible to get such insurance. Pro didn't respond. There's a big downside risk to the kid falling off the roof. Aside from cost, you could end up in jail for child endangerment. I cited reference [3] on the required battery maintenance that includes inspection and cleaning off corrosion on the terminals and inspecting for bad batteries. The system is running at household voltage, 120 or 240 volts. That's anther another liability problem with kids working with high voltages. If one battery failed the whole set would ordinarily have to be replaced. Pro said he planned on replacing them all at end-of-life. That's not the problem. It poses a cost risk if one fails prematurely. You will get a new battery on warranty, but probably not a whole set. Taxes Pro argues adding the $90,000 system to the home will only increase the assessment by $30,000 or so. that would be logical, but localities are interested in collecting as much tax as possible so ""... a cost based approach may be used."" http://en.wikipedia.org... They use what it costs rather than what it's worth to a new owner. Being our own electric utility Pro counts on selling electricity into the power grid whenever surplus power is produced by the systems. Now, laws require that the utilities accept the power and pay for it. The requirement is a subsidy to home solar. The cost to the utility of providing electricity is mainly in the fuel for generators; Pro didn't contest that's only about a third. Two-thirds is in the capital costs including maintaining the grid. Utilities do buy power from outside their grid system, but they get to choose when to buy it and how much to buy. Meeting peak demands is the major need, as late on hot summer days when the air conditioning loads peak. That's precisely when home solar power does not have any spare to sell. Pro's notion of selling power into the grid evades all the costs of setting up and running the grid. For the power company, they save a little fuel cost if they can throttle back some generators, but the capital and maintenance costs are not paid by a system that only sells into the system when he wants to. Pro suggested that if the power company didn't want the power, it could be sold to neighbors. I pointed out that requires permission to set up a competing utility, and he dropped that idea. The bottom line My numbers in R3 withstand scrutiny. If the money put into solar were invested instead, after 25 years there would be $214,000 in the account, and $59,000 worth of electricity would have been purchased from the power company. Including the cost of capital, the solar electric system cost would 5.0 times the grid cost. The resolution is negated. Vote Con. Thanks for a good debate."	CON	need cash	need cash
100	S195e5f1a-Acefa570c	0	2	Do we need cash?	The Federal Defense of Marriage Act is Unconstitutional	"I appreciate my opponent's concern that he may have annoyed me with his anticipatory rebuttals, and he need not worry. As a matter of fact, it is sort of an unspoken rule that the final debater never bring up new arguments. The final debater may summarize his/her position and offer final rebuttals, but adding new arguments that cannot be addressed generally loses one the conduct vote. That being said, I will indicate below where I stand with regards to all his preemptive rebuttals. My opponent criticizes my position as not being practical, saying that ""it is safe to assume that congress has no intention of creating civil unions in the near or long term future."" First of all, predicting the future does not prove his case one way or the other. However, even if this were likely to be the case, as he suggests, it does not make DOMA unconstitutional. The conjecture on Congress' future actions has no bearing on the constitutionality of anything. To strengthen this argument, he appeals to ""Breedlove v. Suttles."" This is not a direct analogy. My opponent equates the attempt to suppress one's right to vote with the attempt to suppress one's right to marry someone of the same sex. This begs the question since he presupposes homosexual union to be an inalienable right. Discrimination itself is not unconstitutional, as we discussed earlier. In the case of ""Breedlove v. Suttles,"" however, discrimination was causing a constitutional violation of voting rights. DOMA does not fall into this category. DOMA clarifies the current marriage laws to refer to the heterosexual marriage institution, as it had been implicitly understood for generations. This does not permanently prevent homosexual marriage, regardless if homosexual marriage were considered a right. My opponent goes on to assert that without compelling state interest, separate but equal institutions violate equal protection since they are separate for the sole purpose of discrimination. I've already argued this point. More than half the states are opposed to homosexual marriage, so Congress' actions were not done for the ""sole purpose to discriminate."" Congress chose to discriminate in response to state pressure. Congress' interest, in this matter, was sufficiently compelling. My opponent's response to this reason is that state opinion, if allowed to be so influential, would prevent the Supreme Court from making any controversial decisions. This is a straw man defense. First of all, I logically linked state opinion with Congress' actions, and he rebuts by hypothetically linking state opinion to Supreme Court ineffectiveness. He never really rebutted my position here. His citing of controversial Supreme Court decisions has nothing to do with the legitimate motives of Congress regarding DOMA. There is little else more compelling to Congress than more than 50% of the states demanding the power to self-govern the marriage institution. This is further supported by the fact that a Democratic President willing to stand up for homosexual rights in the armed forces quickly signed off on the act. In an attempt to anticipate possible new arguments I would bring up, my opponent refutes the argument that marriage is defined by the act of procreation. This is not an argument I intended to offer. I agree with my opponent that it is a weak argument, but would further add that it has nothing to do at all with the constitutionality of DOMA. My opponent's second anticipatory rebuttal was against an argument that marriage, being defined as a constructed institution between a man and a woman, cannot by definition be discriminatory. I would not have made this argument primarily because it would contradict my earlier arguments. I argue that marriage is a construct, and as such, is very much discriminatory. That's the whole point. The Girl Scouts discriminate against boys because the organization defined itself as such. Marriage, as I mentioned before, has been discriminating against homosexuality for eons because of its very definition--until recently--has always assumed heterosexual union. My opponent says, ""Considering homosexual marriage by how it has always been defined is circular and redundant."" This is but a truism, not really adding or detracting from the resolution. Congress being ""redundant"" or ""circular"" is neither here nor there when determining whether or not DOMA is constitutional. The only criterion is whether or not DOMA violates the U.S. Constitution itself. To close, I will summarize my position succinctly. DOMA is constitutional. It does not violate Full Faith and Credit, as my opponent agrees, because it is sanctioned by Full Faith and Credit. It does not violate Equal Protection for several reasons: Congress had compelling state interest to make the marriage distinction, it does not prevent the same rights granted to homosexual marriage at either the federal or state levels, and it does not deny heterosexual marriage to anyone. This is all that is necessary to negate the resolution. DOMA might be old fashioned, non-progressive, or downright mean, but it does not violate the U.S. Constitution. I would like to thank my opponent for this challenging debate topic. Four out of the five last debates I participated involved forfeited rounds. It is a pleasure to debate with someone that shows up and brings his ""A"" game. Thank you."	CON	need cash	need cash

""We were $5.6 trillion in debt from our previous presidents and George W. Bush advanced our debt. A $236 billion cash on hand became a $412 billion deficit in four years under George W.

George Bush and his Republican friends used the existing cash on hand of $236 billion included in the $5.7 trillion projected over the next 8 years into big oil companies and tax cuts for the rich and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. While costs of the invasions of Afghanistan piled up, George Bush didn't increase the tax nor make a budget but allowed the next generation to handle our debt. As a result, the government borrowed money to pay for the biggest costs and the Republicans predicted a $61 billion surplus even though they created a budget that added $251 billion to the deficit. During Bush's presidency, jobs only grew 2% and the GDP only grew 2.1%. The worst decade for the stock market which was down 26% from 2000 was in George W. Bush's term. 7 million jobs were lost, 14.5 million people were left unemployed, and 6 million out-of-work adults stopped looking for work because it was too depressing. Manufacturers fell to its lowest level in 26 years. The jobless rate reached a 26 year high. Net job creation has been 0% since December 1999. George W.

Democracy & freedom is great but when your economy becomes 5.7 trillion dollars in debt in 8 years while adding another 5.6 trillion to the debt because of previous presidents, it makes 11.3 trillion dollars in debt while other countries are celebrating freedom and democracy. We need to help ourselves FIRST and then help others because if we don't, we may be one of the worst economically secure country and might even los our freedom! And the debt was made 5.7 trillion dollars more under a Republican Congress from 2000-2006 so you can't blame the Democratic Congress for the ""Bush tax cuts"" which cost the economy the most.

"Before I start the third round, I need to say that I am expecting a debate, not an info collection contest. ""All in all, if you want to win this, you will need to find hard evidence that says that China is a current threat, and that China will act on this. Also, you will need to show how China will not be hurt from stopping trade with the US. Please cite everything so I can be sure you are not just making something up."" You do not need to tell me what I need to do in order to win this debate and I know what I am doing. And I lived in Hong Kong for 15 years and my family is in China. I believe my information is correct. If you think my information or data provided previously is not accurate or I made something up, please free feel to point out and attack upon it, which is, after all, your responsibility. ""And please make the sources credible. I know full well how easy it is to set up a website that says whatever you want it to. And please be assured, I will do everything I can to do the same."" I don't even make websites, so you don't need to worry, or maybe that is a practice you will use. A real debate should like an impromptu speaking; I am writing this right after I read your argument and I am not going to do researches upon it. This debate is about cross-examining and rebuttal skills and I hope you understand it. I understand both of your arguments about ""cashing"" bonds and definition of ""threat,"" and I think we both agree on some points but not all. First, your point about China is going to take the risk to ""cash"" the bonds is a good one, but I disagree with the way you look at it. It doesn't matter if China is going to take the risk to ""cash"" them; the treat is still in the United States. The United States has to prepare herself for any predictable situations. A threat is a threat. If China is going to take the risk to ""cash"" the bonds, then that is not a threat but destructions. This also applies on the situation if China is going to pull all the business out of the United States. China may not do that, most likely, and I agree with that. But we need to focus on the word ""can."" China can ""cash"" all the bonds; China can pull all the businesses out of US. The fact that China can do all that is a threat to US and US is worried about it too. I am sure you have heard the saying, ""A risk is also an opportunity."" You viewed the relationship between China and the United States is an opportunity that can help the growing economies of both. I agree, but I also see this as a risk, a threat. For example, Cooperation A is working with Cooperation B on some projects. They can benefit from each other. But since their services are in the same area, they are also competitors of one another. Who knows if the next day Cooperation A is going to take over the market and Cooperation B will suffer? Back to your argument, you see China and the United States as business partners; I see them as market enemies. They are just getting advantages from each other, and once they lose interest, there will be a big fight. About the second arguing point, I can see your point which China has no intention to hurt US. But we need to realize even (if) China does not give out an intention; the United States sees one anyway. We are looking from the United States perspective, not from China. The United States is threatened because of the extremely fast growing rate of Chinese economy and that is incontrovertible. The possibility of being taken over by China as the Number 1 superpower in the world is fairly large and the United States aware of it. How can you see there is no threat? No matter how you persuade me that China will not threaten the United States, the United States acknowledge one out there in China anyway. All I said before was that China is a ""friend"" to US but also a threat to US. No matter how many difficulties they have been through, someday they can still betray each other and that is a worry, a threat. Also, the way we view this resolved is very different: I set this resolved is from the view point of the United States, not China's. Therefore, even (if) China has no intention to threaten the United States, the United States worries anyway."	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	Sec0b3071-Af8a29a17	0	1	Do we need cash?	"We should change the ""Work-System"""	Sry for my English. So my POV: We have too many useless Jobs in the world. For Example Call Center Agents or 24hour super market worker... But we need them because we need money. So here's my Problem. We should think of a better Method where we can earn money without forcing people to do senseless Jobs. I mean we are working 40h per week and 5 days.. 2 days off and sometimes not even in the row. And this is what we do the next 50 years. Nice. I mean yea I have a nice Job with nice money but I cant understand why people let their life control by work/money. People don't even know what to do without a job because they never had a chance to try it out ( without living on he street obv) We are so many people.. 1 of them must have an idea. I mean let the people work voluntary and let the people alone if they don't want to work. Yea, there is the money problem. Maybe give all people the same amount of money and working people get extra cash. So you can live good without working and live better if you work. This is just a random idea, there are millions of intelligent people out there with better ideas. So, tbh, I see the working system of today as he modern slavery. I do stuff that I wouldn't do normally for little money (people who get big cash are not that much obv) Someone in the 90s or something said that we would need to work 4hours a day in the future because of automation but we cant afford it or else we wouldn't get enough cash to live. I don't know if money or the work is the problem. Some Jobs needs to be done and with so many people here there must be someone who would do it. In China 600k people die per year because of overworking. Random fact. We are not here on this planet to work our whole life. That's my point. Do you like the Work system of today or would you change something?	PRO	need cash	need cash
100	Se65e7508-Ab65c52be	2	2	Do we need cash?	We should decrease cash handouts.	"My opponent thinks that cash handouts should be decreased. For this debate I will consider 'cash handouts' comprise of at least two things. One that cash or other equivalent to monetary payment is given to individuals or groups. And two that it is a 'handout', in other words given without contract or obligation such as a contractually arranged bonus, dividend or payment for goods and services. Cash handouts are a useful tool for alleviating poverty, and providing substance to people who need it the most. A tool that is needed more than ever in the last few years as rising income inequality worldwide has made the poor poorer and the rich richer (1). In the world one quarter of all people subsist on just 1% of world income (1). The problem is not getting better. The income inequality problem is not indigenous to people within nations either. The 'gini coefficient between nations' which measures the disparity of income between different counties has grown over the last 60 years from ~.44 to ~.55 (2). And even in those rich nations that would supposedly be beneficiaries, the gini coefficient among the inhabitants has been worsening even faster. Globally in 1980 the richest 1% shared about 10% of world income. More recently they share almost 20% of world income. (3) All these facts show that the idea of giving to the poor or middle class cash handouts is not an idea that threatens the security or erasure of social class' who can afford to pay. But can nations afford to pay for the current or increasing cash handouts? Yes they can. The OECD comprises of 20 nations, the majority of which are among the richest nations on the planet. The average corporate tax rate for OECD nations has decreased from ~50% in 1980 to ~33% in 2011 (4) . Which underlines the real reason for increases in deficits, not a 'spiraling out of control' welfare system which is, taken on the whole, a myth. And we see the effects of this lax tax policy directly in the gini coefficient inequality growing. In addition cash handouts given to the poor and middle class are the most likely to be spent in the economy quickly directly benefiting corporations to a degree. So far I have touched on cash handouts for the poor and middle class but not organizations or for the rich. Corporate cash handouts are a valuable tool of nations to subsidize industries that have potential for providing long term competitive advantages and kick starting new technologies as well as ensuring domestic protection of vital industries. Handouts to organizations who also aim to good globally serve as tools for nations to leverage and influence third parties or other nations to serve their agenda without resorting to war or deadly and destructive conflict. Cash handouts to such industries or organizations as solar and alternative power, universities, the world health organization and farmers, benefit all of humanity globally. The safety and promotion of ample food supplies through farming handouts in combination with food stamps or cash payments to the poor for food is a tool to make sure no person should starve if they are adequately provided for. Subsidizing industry produces technology that is not yet economically profitable to be developed and deployed faster. And programs and charities that aim for population control in areas dangerously fast population increases ensures that we will not face a global crisis or global holocaust in the future. If there is a question about the wrong type of people or organizations receiving too generous cash handouts for the wrong reasons. It is not an effective argument that cash handouts should be reduced on the whole. It is only an argument that they should be redirected or planned more effectually. In addition the continually increasing global GDP (5) and future projections of rising GDP (6) give rise to the argument that there is no need to decrease cash handouts in the face on increasing production and an increasing population who may also need increased cash handouts.

100	S49eee388-A253b4baa	0	1	Do we need cash?	The United States National Debt is the Amount of Money the United States has Created not Borrowed	"Thanks for the debate akphidelt Try not to call your opponent an idiot next time - it's rude. ==Can the government simply create money?== Yes. My opponent is smart enough to know how they can do this. The Fed can ""create"" money and increase the money supply by changing the Fed Funds Rate (the interest rate that they lend to banks) or by changing the Reserve Requirement. Both of these increase the money supply and allow banks to ""create"" more money on their balance sheets, by giving out more loans, without having to accept more deposits. They can also print money (my opponent never says what law requires them not to). ==Can the government pay down the debt== My opponent has successfully proven that Clinton's entire surplus came from Social Security revenue, which by law, must be invested in Treasuries (because otherwise, if it just sits there, inflation decreases its value, so it needs a safe rate of return). However, Clinton's way of saving money is not the only way. We could privatize Social Security (20% of our budget) or cut military spending and use that money to pay down the debt. This is the core of the Paul Ryan plan - to cut Medicare and Social Security, however the Democrats put huge defense cuts in the debt ceiling bill. This is so obvious it shouldn't need to be proven - that the government can pay off the debt if it wants to. If you believe I won this point, I win the whole debate, since my opponent believes that if we paid off our debts, money would just start randomly vanishing out of the economy. This is not true. The money would leave our economy only if the person owning the Treasury bond lived in another country and the money doesn't just vanish either - it still exists. ==Greece== My opponent's only real response to this is arrogance. I know that since Greece doesn't control the central bank, it cannot devalue the currency like it would like to in order to pay off its debt, while the US can use inflation to pay off our debts (although it's not a good option because it leads to a death spiral of markets reacting badly, forcing more inflation and ultimately hyperinflation). My point here was merely that investors wouldn't be worrying about either Greece or the United States' ability to pay them back if borrowing money just created new money, rather than creating debts. We do owe the money to people, otherwise the S&P downgrade of our debt wouldn't be a big deal. Once again, my opponent creates a red herring and doesn't respond to the main argument: we ""borrowed"" because we owe the money to someone. My opponent says, ""==The government can OBVIOUSLY create money without issuing debt.== This is not true otherwise they would do it. Which is why all these shenanigans have to take place for them to create money."" Lol. The government takes on debt because it needs to borrow money to pay its bills (which is why we needed the debt ceiling raised). If it JUST wants to create money, say, to increase the money supply, it changes the Fed Funds Rate. I didn't realize until NOW that my opponent seriously believed there was NO OTHER WAY to create money. He keeps waffling on his advocacy in this debate - backing off extreme statements, then remaking them. ==Clinton== Lol. He now says, ""There is no dollar in existence that is not backed by debt."" I thought he was using the billions in gold to show that nearly half our money supply is backed by gold. If there is no dollar in existence not backed by debt, then there must not have been money before debt existed. Look to 1980 - how was the number of dollars in circulation nearly TWICE what the debt was? Answer: because debt is NOT the only mechanism used to create money, it is just the one the government uses when they need it, and they are not really ""creating and NOT borrowing"" money; they are creating money on a balance sheet, the same way that the bank does when you BORROW money. Creating money, in this sense, should mean printing money, since that is the only way the government can create money without borrowing it and owing it to someone. ==M2 does not include loans== My opponent is just sketchy. Read wikipedia. M2 includes notes and currency, traveler's check, demand deposits, other deposits, time deposits, and large time deposits. There's even a chart. Nowhere does it say loans. My opponent seems so sure of himself that he probably didn't bother reading his own source. M2 does not include loans, which means that it's pretty telling that the total amount of money in circulation is not even close to our debt number. 9 does not equal 14.5. ==Warren Buffet== Appeal to authority. And the S&P downgrade was to show that people are worried if we can pay them back, showing that debt is ""borrowed."" Buffet even says we can pay off our debt, supposedly something my opponent denies. ==Why do we need primary dealers?== My opponent claims to create money. However, firstly, if this was the case, why do we even allow 30% to directly purchase, since this doesn't create money. Why not require all purchases to go through primary dealers? Because that 30% matches the 30% of debt purchased by foreign central banks. The other 70% is bought by small investors, mostly in the US. When the government needs to sell debt QUICKLY (like right after the debt ceiling raise, when they had less than 24 hours to pay our bills), they need money fast and don't want to wait on small time investors to bid at auction, so they require a bank to purchase the T-bond, and then flip around and sell the T-bond. However, cash is paid for the Treasury bond at the end point, meaning money is TEMPORARILY created by the bank to pay for the T-bond, but that created money is then erased off their balance sheets when someone gives them real money for it, hence the money is borrowed and owed to than investor. My opponent asks this question: ""why would a country that has it's own made up currency need to borrow it's own made up currency?"" Simple, same reason they need to tax us. They can make up more of the currency in OTHER ways, but this causes inflation because money markets aren't stupid. My opponent next lists 4 things I'm supposedly wrong about. This is petty, especially since he was wrong about M2, he was caught with his pants down double and triple counting when he was doing his math (so if there is a real ethical violation here, it's him), 2 of the other points I'm also not wrong about, if you take my arguments back IN context, and the last (Clinton) I'm still right about since my opponent said, during his little sketchy calculation, that intragovernmental debt should be excluded from our debt calculations, since no ones worries about the government's ability to pay ITSELF back, so technically Clinton reduced the debt we do care about. Dropped Voters. Vote Con if you agree that: 3) You believe the government can pay off its debt whenever it chooses to, without shrinking the amount of money in circulation. 4) You believe that Treasuries are sold for cash at the END POINT. Cash is traded for Treasuries, ultimately, and we use that cash to deficit spend (example, China buying our debt). 6) You believe that the Fed doesn't even need to issue debt to print money. It could just use a printing press or change the Fed Funds Rate, which is the whole point of the floating currency. The government can OBVIOUSLY create money without issuing debt. Other voters: money supply doesn't match debt - 9 doesn't equal 14.5; we obviously owe money to China, so we did ""borrow""; QE2 did not force banks to lend more money, so debt purchases by the Fed FAILED to increase the money supply, in spite of that actually being the goal of their policy for once (they couldn't change the Fed Funds Rate since it was already near zero). My opponent says he learned nothing from this debate - probably because he refused to believe I could be right about even something so simple as defining M2, in spite of having a degree in Economics.

The Federal Defense of Marriage Act is Unconstitutional	"I must extend much appreciation to my opponent as he is both a challenging debater and remarkably well written, which is made all the more impressive given his age. In order to keep the scope of this debate on target, I will once again remind the readers that we are arguing for or against the constitutionality of DOMA. All other discussion is simply evidence for or against this main goal. Thus far, my opponent cites two offended constitutional clauses: Full Faith and Credit and Equal Protection. My only goal and burden is to show that these two clauses (as well as any others presented by my opponent) are not violated. 1. DOMA does not violate Full Faith and Credit While my opponent acknowledges Congress' constitutional power to prescribe how Full Faith and Credit is to be administered between states, he adds the caveat that Congress' power is not unlimited. Indeed, this is absolutely true. Congress' power is limited by the U.S. Constitution. Since the Full Faith and Credit clauses grants Congress power to determine how Full Faith and Credit is administered, it stands to reason Congress' use of this power is constitutional if and only if it does not violate other clauses such as Equal Protection. Therefore, DOMA does not violate Full Faith and Credit. 2. DOMA does not violate Equal Protection With Full Faith and Credit eliminated from the issue, we can turn our attention entirely on the issue of Equal Protection. My opponent touches on several points which I will rebut. a) First, my opponent claims that the denial of 1,138 federal provisions for married couples is a violate of equal rights. Yet, DOMA does not prevent any person in America from receiving these rights. Every state has the power to provide the same legal benefits to both heterosexual and homosexual unions. And though DOMA federally defines marriage to mean heterosexual marriage, the federal government is still permitted to add all the same benefits to any other marital union it wishes. b) In ""Loving v. Virginia,"" it was determined that denying anyone wishing to enter into the marriage institution as it was then defined (i.e., heterosexual) was unconstitutional. Since then, no one is denied the protections of this institution as long as the accept the criteria that defines it, i.e., heterosexual union. c) My opponent says, ""By limiting the definition of 'marriage' to 'one man and one woman', DOMA bans all homosexual marriage on the federal level."" This is absolutely false. DOMA does not, in any way whatsoever, prevent homosexual marriages in states that legalize them nor does it prevent Congress from creating any number of homosexual marriage protections, even 1,138 of them. DOMA certainly is a hurdle to homosexual marriage advocates, but a ""hurdle"" does not equal ""unconstitutional."" d) I will concede to my opponent the argument that biological or learned homosexuality is irrelevant to the debate. In either case, Equal Protection is not violated. Whether one cannot help being homosexual or has chosen it willingly, they are still fully at liberty to enter into the heterosexual marriage institution. My rebuttals are certain to seem repetitive, but that's because the reasoning behind my position is very simple. Just because someone wants the same protections as someone else does not automatically mean a violation of Equal Protection has occurred. I may desperately want the same protections of certain religions, nonprofit organizations, or minorities, but it does not follow that my denial of such protections is unconstitutional. Until it is conclusively determined that one has a civil right to a particular institution can Equal Protection be invoked. Consider the hypothetical scenario in which Congress immediately adds the same 1,138 protections to a second institution called civil union. In such a case, both heterosexual and homosexual unions have equal federal protection. I submit that the scenario is constitutional, and DOMA therefore is also constitutional as it fully allows such a scenario to occur. At best, my opponent has argued that this is equivalent to ""separate-but-equal."" In Brown v. Board of Education, it was determined that everyone has a civil right to public education with equal protection. Separate facilities by their nature were determined to be unequal. However, marriage does not fall into this same conflict. Marriage is a construct, a definition. No one has a civil right to be labeled identically to someone else. That is to say, if the government chooses to recognize a variety of marital institutions, there is no inalienable right to insist they be lumped into a single institution. And if my opponent insists that all people have a civil right to a singular, universal marital institution called marriage, then he essentially claims that people have a civil right to define marriage. There is no precedent in which anyone is entitled to such protections. In summary, DOMA does not prevent the same rights granted to heterosexual marriage to be applied to homosexual marriage. It does not explicitly or implicitly ban or outlaw homosexual marriage. It simply defers the recognition of the institution to the states. There is no doubt as to the controversial nature of DOMA. The idea that same-sex marriage is not getting the same benefits and protections as heterosexual marriage generates a lot of heating emotion. But how we react or feel about DOMA should have no bearing on whether or not it's constitutional. No matter how non-progressive DOMA may be, it does not logically follow that it unconstitutional."

100	S4b1fdaa4-A612a660d	0	2	Do we need cash?	The US needs to abolish the Federal Reserve.	"There are many reasons why the U.S. needs the Federal Reserve Bank, but I will open with these Five: 1) Bank functionality: The Federal Reserve is the ""bankers bank""; when a person deposits money into the bank in a checking account, the vast majority of that money does not stay there. It either goes out via loans, vault cash, or, and most importantly, to a reserve account at the Federal bank. This account is protected by the Federal Reserve, insuring that a bank robbery would not destroy a banks cash. It protects Americans and their banks. 2) Check Clearing: the Federal Reserve bank clears all of the checks in America. When Suzie Q, who has an account at Bank of America, writes a check to Johnny Joe, who has an account at Washington Mutual, the banks do not argue with each other for the cash. Rather, the check is submitted to a Federal Reserve District Bank. The Federal reserve then withdraws the money from Bank of America's account there and deposits it in Washington Mutual' s account. This is an essential part of a functioning bank. 3) Issuing Paper Currency: The federal reserve does not print money, but it does issue currency to banks. For example, during the Christmas season, many people make larger than normal cash withdrawals. Banks need to replenish their vault cash, so they contact the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve then issues the bank cash while subtracting the amount of issued cash from their account. This insures banks have the vault cash they need while at the same time not acquiring any more currency than they already have. 4) The Governments Banker: Our government collects and spends an enormous amount of money. Like an individual, the government requires a checking account to do this. The Federal Reserve acts as the primary checking account holder, its banker. If the Federal Reserve were not in place, a myriad of private banks would be required for the governments checking accounts. 5) Control the money supply: our government has two ways to stimulate or constrict our economy, fiscal policy, handled by the Congress and Executive, and monetary policy, handled by the Federal Reserve. Through controlling the supply of money through a variety of operations, not just the Discount Rate, the Federal Reserve is able to quickly act in economic crisis, much quicker than the Congress or the Executive. It also has the added advantage of being an appointed body in that it is solely responsible for low inflation and sustained economic growth, and not trying to campaign for re-election every few years. I would ask my opponent to review this information and provide realistic alternatives to banking and government given the essential, efficient and effective nature of the Federal Reserve Bank."

You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"

74	S656d76d6-A3a853b7a	2	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Detectableninjas Tournament: Free Museam Admittals	First, I apologize for not submitting an opening argument. Sometimes life gets in the way of your plans and I really do regret those big red letters in my R2 Counterproposal: Museums should charge an admittance fee except on the third Sunday of every month. Competitiveness: My counterproposal contradicts the Resolution “Museum admittance should be provided at no charge.” The Resolution implies that ALL museum admittance should be without charge. If this were not the case the resolution would read “Some museum admittance should be provided at no charge.” The resolution is clearly about universally free museums, which my counterproposal contradicts. MORE IMPORTANTLY, my counterproposal meets the Burden of Proof set forth by my opponent: “should Con give a sufficient example of a case where a museum should charge a fee, he shall be the winner.” I am doing more than providing a single case where a museum should charge a fee, I am claiming that in 29/30 cases, museums should provide admittance. MY CP SOLVES THE PROS ADVANTAGES: Culture in Society: One day a month free admittance offers the opportunity to attend a museum to everyone. All people have the option to attend a museum for free once a month, and so all people in society have access to open information and communication. Shafting the Poor: One free day a week grants museum access to people of all incomes, preserving the right of every individual to a free education and ensuring all have access to the unique benefits of museums. MY CP UNIQUELY SOLVES THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES Cost of upkeep: According to the American Association of Museums, 33% of museum upkeep comes from admittance fees. Depriving museums of fees would cause the following: a) The museum must make up the cost through other venues. If museums could get an additional 33% funding from private donors or investments they would be doing it now, so the only source left is the government. If government subsidies pick up the slap, our museums would receive over 50% of their funding through the government. Given the current economic and political climate, government is more likely to CUT funding than increase it. b) Museums must cut costs to accommodate loss of income. Cutting 33% of operating costs would result in a drastic drop in quality of service, diminishing the quality of education Pro describes in her opening round. This kills all the educational benefit museums are currently providing, meaning Pro’s position results in a net decrease in Culture/education in society. My CP maintains the current quality of museums while offering access to those who cannot afford it. My CP would result in some loss of revenue, but far less than Pro’s plan. Additionally, free museum days are typically more crowded, providing incentive for patrons who can afford it to pay admittance on non-free days. Also, people will pay for the convenience of attending a museum at their leisure rather than planning for a free day. FINALLY: Even if you don’t accept my CP, my Cost of Upkeep argument still applies. Dropping admittance fees will ultimately hurt the quality of museums and therefore the culture and educational services they provide. A 33% budget cut is a LOT of money. Additionally, museum admittance fees are already very low. The average cost of attending a museum is $7 (AAM source again), less than your average movie theater ticket. I would argue that this affordable for most families as a special outing. If a family cannot afford a 7 dollar museum ticket, chances are that other economic barriers such as transportation cost will prevent museum attendance as well. The removal of museum fees will then have minimal impact on accessibility. http://www.aam-us.org...	CON	museums free charge	museum free charge

74	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind.

The poor were not encouraged to visit museums after they were made free	When Labour scrapped the admission charges, the idea was to stop museums being middle class enclaves. They wanted poorer families to attend museums more frequently, and they believed it was best to scrap the admission charge. However, statistics have shown that whilst there has been an 87% increase in attendees, there has only been a 2% increase in the proportion of attendees who were from the poorest half of society. [[Richard Morrison, The Times, 22 September 2009]] This means that it is in fact the middle classes, who can afford the fees, who have benefitted from free admission. Surely, to stop these people easily capitalizing on the museums generosity, a more aggressive sales route to get people to pay the voluntary donation would be well placed.

I am really enjoying being on debate.org debating various topics with interesting people. I am surprised that I never found this site before.Here are my responses to your arguments:While many corporations do try to extract the maximum amount of money from customers, it doesn't change the fact that customers can go to a different businees which provides better customer service. In order to stay in business, the first corporation will then be forced to provide better customer service and improve customer relations or go out of business. Case in point: Blockbuster vs Netflix. Blockbuster had terrible customer relations and charged an insane amount of late fees. Netflix came along and charged no late fees. Blockbuster had to file for bankruptcy and close many of their stores. They are still in business but they changed many of their policies to be more customer friendly in order to compete with Netflix. [1] Pro didn't say why corporate philosophy is not appropriate for public services. I say that being able to choose the best service actually helps the financially disadvantaged members because they can shop around for the cheapest price rather than a one-size fits all price.Pay rises for workers in educational and banking institutions might work. However, it is very difficult to measure who helps society the most. However, if customers are given a chance to choose, then all institutions will try to attract them by giving them deals that will help them the most. More customers means more profits for the institution. It will be a win-win. In the United States there are limits on the maximum donations that an individual or corporation can make. It is $2500 for an individual donation and it is a federal crime to evade donation limits through straw donors. Thousands of people donate to their candidate and it would be impossible for all or any of them to influence the politician. Your argument about influence might be true for very large donations but a donation cap like that in the United States solves this problem. With that in mind, it would be inefficient and immoral to prevent volunteers from donating while forcing people to pay higher taxes to fund the elections.Wealthy families are wealthy because they earned the money. They have an absolute right to pass it along to whoever they choose. It would be inappropriate for the government to step in and take a slice of that pie just because they feel that a ""previlieged few"" have too much money and that it needs to be redistributed to people who weren't so previleged. The government can always get the money to fund education by giving student loans that need to be repaid. I don't understand why people can't ""afford"" internships. People get paid to do internships (at least in the US). They don't have to ""afford"" them.It would be nice for everyone to have access to libraries and museums. But this doesn't take away from the fact that not only are they paying for them through taxes, but all the poor people who never use them are also paying for them through their taxes which they might need for more basic things like food and shelter. If you are saying ""tax only the rich"", then I would argue that the rich have no obligation to pay for the maintenance of libraries and museums. What is morally repugant is forcing the rich to pay for free internet for poor children. If they want to donate money to charitable causes such as One Laptop Per Child, they should be highly encouraged to do so. But in a free country, the government should not force people who honestly earned their money to give it up if they don't want to. How then will people find the motivation to work hard and be successful if the government can take their money away at any time? [1] http://en.wikipedia.org....[2] http://en.wikipedia.org..."

74	S737a6d7b-Aa781d398	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Summary	We have to clarify that this side of the house is not trying to get rid of certain parts of history. Under this plan we will allow to display these symbols in schools or museums, because we agree that they have huge historical meaning and they should be taught about in history classes. We state that they shouldn’t be used on the streets and in other public places, because they represent ideas many find unacceptable. Also people when visiting museums or reading books about Nazi and communism agree to be exposed to the information about these regimes, even if it will be unpleasant for them, while people in public places don’t. Also we don’t want to debate whether holocaust happened and what the ultimate truth is, but we state that many people in Baltic states experienced these regimes in real life, and most of them perceive it as something unacceptable. Nazi regime is being criticized by the whole world community and people responsible for the evil actions done by this regime were judged by the war tribunal. The occupation of Baltic states by the Soviet Union was agreed to be illegal by the three governments of Baltic states, the European Parliament, the European Court of Human Rights, United States, the US court laws, and the United Nations Human Rights Council. All these institutions are something we trust in and rely in terms of such matters. If they find the invasion and occupation illegal then it is something that should be treated as unacceptable. Both these regimes left a lot of scars in people’s souls and we would like to protect them from being exposed to unpleasant memories when seeing a swastika on someone’s t-shirt. We proposed idea that both the freedom of speech and self-expression are not ultimate. The burden of proof is to show that by implementing this plan benefits outweigh practical harms. We agree that freedom of speech and right for self-expression are ones of the rights each and every democracy should promote, but what the oppositions fails to understand that these rights are not unlimited. The case with the right for self defense is quite similar – the value of life is the most important right every person should have, but nevertheless we limit the right to self defense to certain extent, because we believe that these rights should be perceived as how the whole society sees them, not how every individual would like to see it in order for people not abusing these rights. That’s why when someone hits a person with a fist, the victim can’t respond the attacker with a gun under the right for self defense. Both sides were arguing whether the society is ready to face Nazi and communist symbols and whether it would be beneficial for people who faced the actions of these regimes in real life to be exposed to them. Even if some people understand these symbols representing jobs for everyone or equality between social classes, the majority sees these symbols to be representing something unpleasant either it’s war, illegal occupation or anti Jew policy. Important is how society overall perceives these symbols, not what meaning a single individual wanted to put in it. And to clarify, both sides also agree today that symbols have a meaning, mentioned in the argument how allowance of symbols would deal with extremist groups. The opposition tried to prove that society is ready for these symbols in real life. First, people older than 20 experienced the Soviet times in real life – time when shops were empty, people couldn’t freely cross the border and couldn’t argue against the policies of the government. Even if there were some benefits in these regimes as jobs for everyone, these ideas could be represented in other manner as it was mentioned in our rebuttal – for example, by wearing a t-shirt that says “planned economy”. We believe that these ideas should be left in the level of education and not brought up to public where it could harm people. That’s why we still allow displaying these symbols in textbooks or museums where people deliberately agree to be exposed to them. Also, there was a ridiculous idea from the opposition, which stated that in order to cure some psychological traumas, people should be exposed to unpleasant events causing these traumas again. Although there was a reference to a scientific source, we do not trust it. By following this logic, it seems that to cure the trauma from being raped, a person should be raped several times again. May be the trauma from the first single rape then will be smaller, but the trauma from being raped for several times will outweigh it. Opposition brought up a point about international relationships and how bad it would impact the relations of Baltic states with our Big Eastern Neighbor. Both sides agree that these relations are tense and there must be some improvement or at least an incentive to do it. What the opposition fails to understand is that the model they are proposing doesn’t work. They didn’t bring any reason why Russia will dislike our plan. Then, even if it dislikes it and responds by creating an opposition to it we say that so called cooperation has never worked so far. Latvia has introduced the reformation of Russian schools, although Russia was against that, and Estonia has removed the Bronze Statue. The opposition called it to be examples of bad diplomacy, we say that these are examples when states do actions beneficial for them without the consensus from Russia. In both these cases Russia had created a severe opposition to the actions of Latvia or Estonia, but Baltic countries still implemented their plans, because they were beneficial for them. We don’t think that the world model where Russia dictates everybody what to do is the best one to live there. There are more important things than few economic benefits coming from Russia, for example the protection of our own citizens that would live in fear from being attacked on the streets by activists from extremist group or being exposed to symbols causing unpleasant feelings in their hearts. The most sensible discussion was about extremist organizations and oppositions failed to understand how these groups work. Neo-Nazi organizations are clearly dependent on these symbols because they represent their ideas. We agree that by banning these symbols they will become a forbidden fruit, but this will give us a reason to punish these groups as there is no way how to deal with them now. We also believe that these organizations do not only physically harm people, but psychologically as well by using symbols that most of society associates with something evil. Under the status quo we can’t fight against it as long as they didn’t use the hate speech. We believe that the government has to protect its citizens even if the harms are only on psychological level, and that’s why we propose this plan. If these groups find a substitution for symbols banned, we believe that this will make them weaker. Substituting a powerful symbol with great historical meaning for a new one that nobody in society knows or has any associations with, definitely will be harmful for these organizations. We believe that in order to protect minorities, build society as a whole, and deal with extremism in general, we have to implement this plan. That’s why we are proud to propose it today!

74	Sd99d90b9-A264804e2	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	"On the following proposed ""economic stimulus"" plan"	"I thank my opponent for his response: Regarding my overview: The overview was simply to frame my argument, nothing more. Please note I did address the minimum wage and child labor in the context of the new government. My opponent has presented a drastic overhaul to the government, so typical arguments concerning these issues in context of our current government are not relevant. All arguments must occur in the governmental framework my opponent offered. Under his framework unregulated unions would control labor; something my opponent intends to happen. This point coupled with deregulation of land use, regulations that preserve the land for future use, render all other points moot. I do not agree that elimination of all the regulatory agencies other than the few I listed would improve the economy. I simply do not have room to address them all, so I chose the ones that put the most pressure on my opponent's new government. Taxes: My opponent clearly stated the only income for the government would be a federal sales tax; therefore, all other taxes are eliminated under his plan including the ones he listed. I saw no need to address the individual taxes as they do not exist. The new unregulated, quasi-governmental role of Unions and Organized Crime: My opponent fully recognizes the new role unions would play in his new government, but does not address the horrid practices of unregulated unions and their connection with organized crime. As I stated, at least with the DoL we can provide political pressure and we have some oversight. Not so under his plan, as all regulatory committees and the regulations they enforce are gone. I addressed the minimum wage in respect to labor unions as the elimination of the minimum wage along with all DoL regulations, including child labor, and OSHA are gone. The unions would organize in the hole left by these now defunct regulatory committees, offering similar service, at a huge price. This new found power, along with deregulation would allow the harsh world of labor-racketeering to proliferate once again along with organized crime. [1] [2] According to the FBI ""We work closely with the Office of Labor Racketeering in the Department of Labor and with the U.S. Attorneys' offices in investigating violations of labor law."" [3] Not anymore; the DoL does not exist. What is the economic impact of organized crime, especially with the newfound powers of the unregulated union? Hard to tell, but, ""[I]t's estimated that global organized crime reaps illegal profits of around $1 trillion per year.""[4] Organized Crime families would place their people at the head of the union and control the means of production by strong arm tactics on business owners. This has all been done before. Unregulated unions do not benefit the United States economy as the proceeds from labor would go to organized crime, as history has shown, and the means to combat such activities would necessitate the reestablishment of the department of labor. Why spend the money to eliminate an agency we would have to recreate to deal with the problems caused by eliminating it? But we would not recreate it under my opponent's plan, as the government is not in the labor business anymore. DoL regulations are in place to combat such problems. Economic argument against Child Labor and for Education: This subject has been addressed so many times. Here is a great discussion paper on the topic. [5 at section 2.2] Child labor decreases human capital and would more so under my opponent's plan as he can only assume people would donate money to schools. Contrary to my opponent's statement, I know public schools are not free and in Tennessee our property taxes provide for the bulk of school funding, not our sales tax. Although the unions would address child labor, as we both see, the union will not cover all businesses, most of them, but not all. A parent is under no obligation to allow the child to attend school. The economic impact in the loss of human capital would be detrimental to the US. Child labor is exploitation plain and simple. We have dealt with this issue in the past [12] and the economic drawbacks of allowing such labor are the reduction of lifetime wage earnings for the child. An uneducated adult without the ability to read or write does not contribute to society as well as one with these fundamental abilities. Public Land: The US Government does charge admission to some of the parks; I never stated otherwise. My opponent listed three: Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone. The government does not charge admission to the Smokey Mountain National Park, The Chickamauga Battlefield, most of the Smithsonian Museums [6], The Washington D.C. zoo [6], etc. Private bodies could purchase these areas and do several things; charge admission, close them off to the public for private use, sell them off piece by piece, or scrap them all together. My opponent lists some of the economic benefits of keeping the parks, and makes an assumption that the new private owners will keep them as tourist attractions as this will be the most profitable. This is certainly a possible use for the land, but the now unregulated logging companies may have a faster return on their investment without all the upkeep in reference to the Smoky Mountains. The Grand Canyon area is full of minerals – what interest would a mining company have in running a tourist attraction? Do you have any idea the market value for the donated exhibits in all the Smithsonian museums? Why keep them open, just sell the stuff to the highest bidder and sell the buildings, as condos in downtown DC carry a heavy price tag [7]. Private owners are perfectly capable of deciding to forgo long term benefits of ownership of land and make for a quick return all the while ignoring the future benefits. Example: We have a great example available in reference to the Grand Canyon. Uranium mines are popping up in a million acre buffer zone near our national landmark. Please note, the mining company is doing everything it can to maintain the area [8] (Good for them, by the way) not because these actions are cheaper or offer a better return, but because they are required. Private ownership of the land does not require such measures and the environmental regulations dealing with such activities are non-existent under my opponent's new government restructuring. All the numbers for tourism, offered by my opponent, do not hold when a negligent private owner allows the area to become contaminated. Indian Reservations I am aware that Indian Reservations are not public land, but the 30% number my opponent offered includes military and Indian lands hence the reason I asked [9] [10] [11]. Now, can the Indians keep the land as it is not private? This plan is not attainable: My opponent does not feel my claim concerning the attainability of this plan is warranted. I must disagree. The political make up of the US would not allow such drastic measures as the ones my opponent presents. His plan would manage to alienate some of the strongest political movements in the US and they have money and candidates. Any president attempting to implement such policies, especially as a whole, would have to contend with Congress, Environmentalists, Veterans, and the list goes on and on and it crosses party lines in the current two party system. 1.http://www.americanmafia.com... 2.http://www.fbi.gov... 3.http://www.oig.dol.gov... 4.http://www.fbi.gov... 5.http://www.lex.unict.it... 6.http://www.si.edu... 7.http://dclofts.com... 8.http://www.nytimes.com... 9.http://strangemaps.wordpress.com... 10.http://www.doi.gov... 11.http://nationalatlas.gov... 12.http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk..."

Museums preserve and display our artistic, social, scientific and political heritage. Everyone should have access to such important cultural resources as part of active citizenship, and because of the educational opportunities they offer to people of every age. If museums are not funded sufficiently by the government, they will be forced to charge for entry, and this will inevitably deter many potential visitors, especially the poor and those whose educational and cultural opportunities have already been limited. Visitors to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London declined by 15% after it started charging for admission. Free access is essential to provide freedom of cultural and educational opportunity.

74	Sbc6467-Ae6f64b44	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Solar Electic Power	I want to thank my opponent for this wonderful opportunity to discuss and debate the economic potential and shortcomings of solar powered systems for your home. This is going to be broken into 3 parts. 1) The suggested solar power system and its initial costs 2) What one would have if one decided not to get solar and just invest the money and buy electricity from the grid 3) What one would have if one decided to invest in this solar system (lol) I will try to be as short as possible because 8,000 is going to be way too little for everything, but, oh well. 1)The Suggested System I strongly advocate being independent and being able to do things yourself to save money (such as learn to fix your own car, build your own computer, etc), so naturally, I would strongly advocate installing your own panels and such. I would argue that the difficulty is not so great that the average person cannot do it, as they do offer kits that come with step-by-step instructions. However, I also fully understand that many are not comfortable with working on new things, especially on their roofs. So I will present the numbers if you install yourself as well as having contractors do it. First, cost of material. We have the solar panels, the inverter, and the batteries. You can buy a boat load of accessories that make it look prettier, but that is optional and so not a requirement. First, we need to know how much energy we need. Our location receives an average of 4.5 sun hours a day (this takes clouds and everything into effect), but in winter, we drop to 3.5 (while summer is up to 5.5). Since a cloudy day in winter means we'll be getting only half energy with 3.5 sun hours, we need to make sure that even on those days, we reach 34.65 kWh (average daily use, by Roy's numbers in his R1). This comes to 19.8 kW system, which will cost $29,017.72 in solar panels [1][2]. It should also be noted that these solar panels come with a 25 year power output warranty. This means that they are guaranteed to provide energy for at least 25 years. If they wear down and start providing less, they will be replaced under warranty. While they will likely last more than 25 years, we will use 25 years as our estimated end point (since everything breaks 2 weeks after warranty anyway). We also see that we will want at least 20 kWh to power the home through the nights, however, I've opted for a slightly larger, 36 kWh battery system so that the solar panels have plenty of time to deal with cleaning every once in a while (that will give a little over 24 hours of energy, while covering for the nights without de-charging too much). These will cost $4,872.00 [3]. These have a 10 year estimated life (7 year warranty), we will assume 2 replacements needed over the course, at 9 years and 18 years. Since I do not know what batteries will cost that far in the future, I will go with today's prices (advanced tech will likely drive prices down, but inflation will drive it back up, so who knows). Our inverter needs to be able to both charge batteries, as well as feed back into the grid. I have selected this inverter for $1,911.34 [4]. It claims to increase battery life by up to 10 years, but we'll ignore this claim as there is no guarantee for it, so it is merely a sales pitch (in my mind). This provides 3,600 VA, well above the average, though I don't know what the average peak usage is (sources vary too greatly). If my opponent would like, I can select a larger one (it will only add 1% to the cost, so it is really marginal when compared to the panels and labor). This allows us to sell our extra electricity back into the grid, however, it should be noted that you sell electricity at wholesale value (about 40% of market value) [5]. This brings the total of our system (with a 9.68% sales tax, national average) to $39,266.60 for this 19.8 kW system. We must now look at labor (while I believe that people should be able to do this themselves, we need to understand that not everyone can). Most contractors will quote you for the total job about $7 - $8 per Watt. It is not possible to get an exact number because it varies depending upon your house, angle of your roof and many other factors. We'll just assume the middle of $7.50 per Watt. Kits come complete at about $5.50 per Watt (and most contractors use pre-done kits). This means that the labor comes in at about $2.00 per W, so a 19.8 kW will have about $39,600 in labor costs alone. This will bring our total up to $78,866.60 with labor. This covers all initial costs, now, we can move to long term costs and benefits. 2)Take the money and run This section will cover if you take that $78,866.60, put it in a utility bond (as suggested by my opponent) and buy their electricity from the grid. While they have a number of options, we should stipulate that they need to choose a safe investment. First thing to consider is that electricity gets more expensive every year. Over the last 8 years, we've seen an average growth of 4.6% (from 8.00 cents in Jan 2003, to 10.99 cents in Jan 2011 [6], look at the excel sheet for historic prices). This puts your yearly electric bill from $1,403.54 this year, to $4,130.34 in 25 years. If we take the $78,866.60, and pull from it only to pay for the electricity, we find that after 5 years, the balance is $86,934.44, after 10, $97,304.37, after 20, $117,112.10, and after 25 years, $124,921.20. This is the golden number to beat. Interestingly, the investment will peak at 28 years at $126,998.10 before electricity costs overcome it (and it will be gone by the 43 year). Of course, if we go with you doing the labor yourself, at 25 years this option will be at $16,148.87 and will dry out at 29 years (this makes the life of the solar panels extremely important). With this, there is no equipment to buy, nor maintain, nor any labor associated that one must take care of. It is all factored into your costs at the meter. 3) Invest in my system I do not have the space to outline in depth what my system will cost, and so will only make some brief points and go into it further in R3. This will also allow my opponent the opportunity to verify the costs of not investing in solar as well as checking out the initial costs of my plan. Here are a list of things I will be going into next round. a) Solar panels increase the value of the home. This will raise both home owner's insurance and property taxes, however, it will also count as a non-liquidable asset. b) Electricity can be sold back at the wholesale rate, which we will count as 40% of the retail rate (grows at 4.6% a year). c) Cleaning of the panels to be done 6 times a year (once every 6 months, and wiping off snow, but the winter cleaning can be done during a snow removal) d) Snow removal and basic cleaning does not need to be professionally done, nor does it take a lot of time. While safety can be a concern, it is no more dangerous than climbing a ladder to clean gutters, which a large number of high school kids looking for beer money will do (besides, kids are durable). e) Batteries are maintenance free for their warranty and without maintenance are still expected to live 10 years (I'm still going with 9 for my calculations). While doing maintenance will extend their life, we've already accepted the 10 year life (though they claim 12 and above). I will have to pass this to my opponent now.

74	Sbc6467-A7ca4245c	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Solar Electic Power	Thanks to Ore_Ele (I believe he is from Krypton) for a superb topic. The reason it is such a good topic is that it is as close to an engineering topic as we are likely to ever see here on DDO, and engineering is more fun than anything else. Well, almost anything else. An engineering topic also means that most readers will be snoring way by the end of R2, but that cannot be helped.For this round, I want to try to establish requirements and categories of costs. I think these will be common to our designs. Grid power costWe need to know how much electricity the average homeowner uses in a year. Homeowners include condo owners in multi-unit buildings. It's doubtful that condo owners will be able to put solar panels on their roof, but the numbers don't seem to change to much by excluding them. The U.S. Energy Information Agency provides a Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) [1. http://www.eia.gov... ].The relevant spreadsheet [2. http://www.eia.gov... says the average home uses 12,656 kWh of electricity. The data appears to have been updated to 2009, the most recent yea available. I'm currently under the impression that electric power consumption is about steady year-to-year.The average residential rate for grid power is 11.09 cents per kWh. It's cheaper in Lexington KY, our chosen city, but I'll use the average rate. Our average homeowner uses $1402.55 worth of electricity per year. That's the target for a solar power system to beat. I'm assuming the grid cost includes taxes buried in the total.Solar costsWe need the add up the costs for installing a solar electric system and convert them to a yearly basic for comparison.Purchased solar panels. This is the price of the panels divided by the life expectancy. Some panels only last 15 years, but 20 or 25 years is more common. The panels deteriorate by 0.5% to 1% per year so the system must be oversized by 12.5% to 25% to compensate. On cloudy days, the solar output drops in half. To make up for a long string of half-power days there has to be either battery storage or the system must be doubled in size from the nominal calculation. Doubling covers a period of cloudiness of unlimited length, so that seems better. I assume that doubling the size would also accommodate unusual periods of high heat that produce high air conditioning costs. I know it helps that summer days are longer, otherwise the peak would be more severe. It does not suffice to provide enough total energy over a year. The peak loads must also met. On the power grid, peak load costs are met by keeping spare capacity in the system.Inverter and batteries.An inverter system must be provided to convert DC from the panels to AC. The inverter system is sometimes included with batteries to provide peak loads and night operation. Inverter systems are advertised to have a life of ten years. Batteries must be kept half-charged to prevent damage, so the size of the battery system must be double the nameplate rated capacity. [3. http://solarpanel-direct.com... ]Other equipment related costs. In addition to the basic equipment, there are costs for shipping, installation, and sales tax.Maintenance. Solar electric systems require cleaning dirt off the panels twice a year, plus snow removal as often as it snows. Looking at the weather records for Lexington, I'm guess there are about five snow falls per year that require snow removal. There is also some maintenance in inspecting and cleaning battery terminals. [3] The homeowner might do this himself, but we are trying to make an apples-to-apples comparison to the power grid, where maintenance is included in the delivered price. The homeowner also might be unwilling or unable to do roof work.Cost of Capital. This is cost of having money tied up in the solar electric system. One way to think of it is he cost to borrow the money to build the system, but it could also be thought of as the value that would be received by investing the money. If capital costs are not counted, then you can get free electricity forever by just putting money in the bank and using the interest to pay the electric bill. Capital costs must be counted.The question is what interest rate to assume. I think the appropriate interest rate to figure is the rate on twenty year utility bonds. We are financing power here, so that is an interest rate for the money used for building power plants. Homeowners are unlikely to get rates as low as public utilities, but homeowners would also have trouble finding a safe investment with a higher yield. The current yield is 4.3%. [4. http://www.finance-mentor.com...] For every $10,000 spent on a solar installation, the cost of capital is $430 each year.My opponent may chose design variations to optimize costs. For example, one might oversize the installed panel capacity by 10% to compensate for deterioration, and then add 10% panel capacity after ten years. Perhaps there are more clever design alternatives. However the system is designed, all the categories of costs must be accounted for.For the record, I agree that reducing dependence on the power grid is a terrific goal. It would get the government out of the loop, and it saves all the money spent on grid costs. About four of the eleven cents in the cost of grid electricity is spent on the power transmission overhead. But while getting off the grid is a terrific goal, achieving competitive cost is probably twenty years away. We'll see.	CON	museums free charge	museum free charge

If state-funded, there is little incentive to increase numbers of visitors	Museums have a valuable role in preserving and transmitting a nation’s history and heritage to new generations. Free access will encourage more people to find out about their country and help to promote feelings of national unity and identity, while promoting greater understanding and acceptance of foreign cultures. A museum’s admission policy ‘encodes the institution’s core values’ (Smith, 2006); free admission symbolizes the relationship between museum and community, rather than that between museum and collections in for-profit establishments. A report by the London School of Economics in 2006 found that in the year free admissions were introduced in the UK, visitor figures jumped from 27 to 42 million (Russell & Taylor, 2007).

Instead similar numbers of people as before chose to make more individual visits to the same museums, pushing up admissions numbers (Martin, 2003). In this way subsidising free admissions acts as a giveaway of public money to the privileged middle classes, who would in any case pay to attend the same institutions.

Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge
74	S656d76d6-Aede6d69f	2	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Detectableninjas Tournament: Free Museam Admittals	Counter ProposalThe plan that my opponent brought up might seem convenient at first glance, but would fail upon application. Would you rather go to a museum on a day that it was free or on a day that it costs money? Most people would pick the first option, causing that one day to be more hectic than the rest. Most buildings have maximum capacity due to fire regulations, meaning a lot of people who opted to go on this day would be left out. Furthermore, people would not enjoy a museum that is jam-packed full of people. People would be rushed through and crowded, so that they could not get the full knowledge that the museum has to offer. This would also create problems with the staff, who would have to accomodate for one extremely busy day out of the month. Proposing to have a one-day-only free admittance to a museum would still be negating the right for citizens to have free knowledge. Only a limited amount of people would have the chance to get into these museums. People who came too late, and people who happen to be busy on that certain day, would still be restricted from their culture. The idea is that EVERY citizen should have the right to free knowledge about their culture, not some citizens who can comply to a strict schedule. Cost detterenceMy opponent says that 33% of a museum's profit is through admittance fees. While this is a decent chunk of cash, museums are already mainly funded by the government. We also know that the government is willing to increase these funds for museums. We can use the National Smithsonian as an example. Their budget funding was raised from $761.4 million in 2010 to $797.6 in 2011. [1] It is not illogical to assume that the government would be willing to fund museums in full. Another way that the museums could maintain their budget is by having at-the-door donations. This would mean that instead of someone being forced to pay a set fee, any willing person could give the museum a donation. Surely, some of the more wealthy museum goers would offer up some of their money to support the museum. This could work in the museums favor, as people would be more willing to give higher amounts of cash. Everyone should have a right to knowledge and a right to culture. Because museums are unique in the way that they transfer that knowledge, denying full free Museum acceptance is denying that right.1. http://en.wikipedia.org...

74	S59e99f04-Abffdf27f	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Solar Power is the future not wind or being oil dependent	Apparently not.Though I really need not put forth much in the way of an argument supporting my position, as you have already, for the most part, though none too coherently, done so, I shall provide a little bit more of a case, as if you actually were playing the role of the Con.Perhaps one of the most common arguments given against solar power, and in favour of petrol, is that solar power is weaker than burning hydrocarbons, and that switching to completely electric fuel would be detrimental to the economy. However, these arguments are not valid, and are merely slanted in such a direction as to keep the world dependent upon large oil corporations, and because humans are generally afraid of progress.Now, there are also significant environmental concerns, from burning hydrocarbons, to the atmosphere, and thus the biosphere. Normally, the planet's carbon should remain in its crust and biosphere. When, as carbon dioxide, it is released from burning hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, it can cause an unbalance in the planet's natural atmospheric balance. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning that it traps heat in the form of infrared radiation inside the atmosphere, maintaining a level of warmth necessary for life. Were there too few greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it would be significantly colder. However, the burning of petrol, coal, and other compounds rich in CO2, releases unnatural amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing Global Warming. Too much global warming eventually leads to a cascading climate change, that cannot be prevented, Runaway Greenhouse Effect. This would destroy our ecosystem beyond repair, and cause the largest extinction Earth has even known: total extinction. This is obviously not a favorable occurrence.There would be no significant economic damage, if the world were to take itself off of hydrocarbon fuel sources, except for countries whose only major export is natural oil, particularly in the Middle East. Germany has already proved that solar energy can be just as efficient as any other energy we have yet devised, in fact, more so even than nuclear energy. The Middle East could easily accumulate solar energy to make up for the lost economic staple, natural oils. In fact, it could become a world energy producer by that. Thus, the economy could flourish on solar energy.One of the large qualms that has been raised, particularly by America, is that the loss of petrol would be multiple nails in the coffin of the automobile industry. While I do not personally think that is such a bad thing, I understand that much of America's economy has been based on automobiles, and they certainly are the primary transportation there. I thus acknowledge that solar energy could also provide the fuel for automobiles. No, not solar panels mounted on the roofs of cars. That would be impractical and tacky. However, Nikola Tesla devised a way of wirelessly delivering electricity from one point to another. Solar power plants could collect energy, by either photovoltaics or some other method, then deliver it to cars through wireless energy transfer coils planted in the roads. This would solve the common complaint that electric cars are not as energy efficient. It has been shown that they are practical in every other way. In fact, in the early 90s, General Motors built a number of prototype electric cars, which were test-driven and found to be highly useful, but recalled and destroyed, because of the possible economic repercussions to the rest of the American auto industry.Sources:http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...http://goo.gl...

74	Sbc6467-Af5d1ba6c	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Solar Electic Power	I would like to thank my opponent for his round. Before I dive into the costs of my system, and what you will have after 25 years left in the bank. There are some things to point out first. 1) My opponent and I came up with the exact same number for the benefit of investing, so that number is essentially solid and I image that we won't need to waste any characters on it. 2) Deep cycle batteries are designed to be able to discharge between 50% and 80% without damaging them [1]. While they have the most efficient life spans when only discharged 50%, that more efficient life charge is why the company advertises them with a 12 year life span and the warranty does only 7 years, so long as the battery is used correctly. A discharge of 80% would fall under correct usage. It should also be noted that I picked a battery system that would only be going over 50% a handful of times a year, and not every night, so this effect is going to be minimal regardless. 3) My opponent is correct that the solar panels are warranted to be at 80% in 25 years. Earlier, he stated that they deteriorate at a rate of 0.5% to 1%, with a middle ground of 0.75%. As such, I will be expanding the solar panels from 86 to 100 (this will raise the cost from $78,866.60 to $90,283.12, and the laborless cost up to $44,283.12). This will put the 25 year amount for the alternative option at $156,279.90 (and $29,928.13 if you do the labor yourself). 4) Removal of snow and dust from the solar panels does not require a professional under any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that kids (the same that are willing to mow your lawn, clean your gutters, etc) would be willing to work at lower rates for that. However, I also believe that $30 per visit is a decent middle ground (coming to $240 per year). This would put the cleaning at $434.09 at year 25, with an average of $327.91 per year. 5) Inflation will factor into: Cleaning costs, property taxes, insurance taxes, value difference of property. 6) Inflation will not factor into: Electricity costs and capital gains from investments. 7) Energy should be able to be sold back into the grid at whole sale cost for a variety of reasons. First, the energy companies actually do want it (though they would prefer it be free for them) since they are getting energy at 60% discount and don't have to make the capital investment for it. This energy is turned around and sold to others at retail value for profit. Second, we are working with the current grid system and it is already set up for this, so the cost of the smart grid is already a sunken cost. If needed, we could argue that the home owner could pay for additional inverters to sell power to his neighbors at some rate between wholesale and retail (where they are not obligated to be 100% off grid and can work both), this however, gets a lot into sales and negotiating prices and just gets to be too many variables. Benefits of my system I will now go into the costs and benefits of my selected system (still comparing to both). Most of what my opponent shows are true costs and I cannot argue against them. We have insurance and property taxes (I grouped together) at $14.10 per $1,000 of home value. For this we only need to look at how the home value changes because of this system. This is where my opponent makes his biggest miscalculation. The amount of money you put into a home renovation does not equal the amount that it changes the value of your home. Anyone that has decided to renovate a living room or bedroom before moving has learned that just because you put $10,000 into the upgrade, does not mean that you will get that back out (you could get more or less, with living rooms and bedrooms, likely a lot less). Green energy options are very similar in that the dollars you put in are not equal to the dollars you get out. For this, we need to look at how energy savers and energy producing things affect home value (this will also need to be adjusted for inflation). Energy savers actually change your home value not based on how much energy they save (makes sense). Current studies estimate that for every $1 you save on annual energy, your home will increase $10 to $25 [2], this variance likely effected by how pleasing the energy savers are to the eye and such. The middle point will be $17.50, but I'll go with a low ball side and suggest $15.00 for every $1 in energy savings. If we look at the initial investment, it saves the total of $1,403.54 in energy, as well as makes another $1,115.54 in energy sold back to the grid (if my opponent rejects the grid, I can come up with a system that sells to neighbors at 20% under market value, since most people wouldn't mind getting some of their electricity from a neighbor at 20% discount, though that will limit our number of rounds of debating). This comes to a total of $2,519.08, which would increase the value of your home by $37,786.23. This seems like it makes for a very poor investment (only increases the value of the home by 40%), however, we must take into account the fact that energy costs are increasing. And so the value of these savings increases the home's value more and more. After 5 years, the panels are producing $3,076.71 in energy (this takes into account that their efficiency has dropped about 3.7% over these 5 years). This means the increase home value is going to be $52,215.27 (at this point we've had 13.14% inflation). Since energy costs are increasing faster than the solar panels' efficiency is decreasing, the net result is a constant increase in value. We can even see that after 20 years (when the panels are down 14% efficiency, but electricity is up 145.83% in cost), that the panels are generating $5,616.41 worth of electricity and adding up $138,047.20 of value to your house (thanks to 63.86% inflation in 20 years). At 21 years, your house has increased by $147,306.40. Over this same 21 years, you'll have put $11,437.26 in the bank from the selling of electricity back to the grid at wholesale. This takes into account the expenses of maintenance, property taxes, insurance, and the revenue of taking the profit and investing it at the rate of 4.3% (why shouldn't it be invested?). So, we find at the 21 year mark, your initial $90,283.12 solar investment (with labor, $44,283.12 without labor) is now worth $158,743.60, while if you just invested in the markets, you'd be at $148,147.40 (or $36,787.68 for the doing labor for yourself). This shows that at 21 years, you've surpassed the alternative investment. Now, if my opponent wishes to argue that we need to go with $50 per maintenance visit, that only pushes back the crossing point by 1 year. What we find, is that if you pay for the labor, the tipping point occurs at 20 years (if you do the labor yourself, that tipping point is only at 3 years). As you can see the labor costs make a HUGE difference, and my opponent actually suggested that labor would be less, and I'm sure, with enough shopping around, you could find less, and as more people do this, the labor costs will drop, but that only changes where the tipping point is, but in all cases where labor is factored, it will be around the 15 – 22 year mark, and in all cases, where you do it yourself, you'll be at around 2 – 4 years. Based on this, it should be quite clear that placing panels on your home (be they on your roof, on in your yard, if big enough) can be a worthwhile investment for many homeowners. Especially those that are capable of doing the labor, or part of it themselves. Of course, we'll also find that location plays a major role, as well as climate. Is it possible that the various factors line up so that solar is not right for some people? Of course, but for the average homeowner, these will line up in their favor. [1] http://www.windsun.com...

Cut Down All the Trees, Put Them in a Tree Museum	We should cut down all the trees, put them in a tree museum, and charge everyone a dollar and a half just to see them. This would greatly stimulate the economy by creating jobs and the economic exchange of going to a museum to see trees would generate tax revenue. But we don't want to tax them too much. The owners of the museums should have as high of profits as possible so they can invest those profits in our economy and make more money encouraging economic growth and ultimately leading to higher tax revenues as that money circulates through our economy. Also people like seeing trees. It's a real shame that people get to see trees for free.

74	S2db4e8f9-A38f576d1	0	1	Should all museums be free of charge?	"""The minimum legal drinking age should be age 25"""	"I'd like to thank CON for a great debate. O1) Paternalism Principle The government is more rational and better at making decisions than most people. Almost all lawmakers have a college degree. Congressmen have consultants to help them understand technical details. Lawmakers debate extensively using scientific research. Lawmakers have the time to analyze risk and reward. The average person does not. Therefore the paternalism principle has merits. We are not designed to ‘analyze risk over reward for every action'. Con has the BOP to show otherwise. Adults under 25 are especially bad at this task [1]. We are designed to survive in prehistoric times, not modern times with automobiles, weapons, and drugs. Con also uses a slippery slope fallacy to state that ‘why not the government regulate our every move?' It is better to learn from one's mistake as long as the mistakes will not cause serious permanent damage. Con's examples do not fit into this category. Consuming large amounts of alcohol does. If Con truly believes in the libertarian ethics, would he allow all drugs and banish the FDA? Should school not be compulsory? a) War on Drugs Drugs are still illegal in Portugal just decriminalized. Drug trafficking is still a criminal offense, and possession is still fined. [2] Con states ""16% have used cocaine."" The key word is ""used"" not ""active users"". If one takes that into account, the number is only 2%[3] This is a much smaller number than when cocaine was used widespread[4], demonstrating the success that the war on drugs has had. Con states that ""even if Pro can prove that paternalism worked, that doesn't justify the principle's use."" Pro has made a positive affirmation without backing up his claim. How is it unjustified? b) Seatbelts Seatbelt laws are effective. 80% of Americans using a seatbelt is a great number! People still commit murders even though it is illegal. That does not mean murder should be legal. c) Helmets Con's source proves nothing. The study didn't even apply to motorcyclist. Motorcyclists are required to wear helmets in laws in some states, not bicyclist. According to an article in the Journal of Medical Associations: ""Head injury death rates based on motorcycle registrations were also lowest in states with comprehensive helmet-use laws.""[5] O2) Brain development Unless Con can debunk the study I presented, it is a safer bet for the minimum drinking age to be 25, not 21. Your source says nothing about neurons not forming, just the distance between connections. It's a very hasty assumption to assume that means the brain does not mature. C1) Alcohol impedes brain development Often if people drink, they drink more than moderation. Both personal experience and evidence demonstrates this. Still, even moderate drinking causes brain shrinkage [6]. C2) Other harms Adolescents are still below the age of 25 so my sources still stand. C3) Alcohol harms others The source I cited states in its conclusion: ""Compared with a wide range of other programs and efforts to reduce drinking among teenagers, increasing the legal age for purchase and consumption of alcohol to 21 appears to have been the most successful effort to date""[7] The issue of drunk driving is associated with alcohol consumption, since one need to consume alcohol in order to drink and drive. This is the same logic of why enriched uranium and dangerous chemical possessions are regulated. Con states there is a difference since they can only be used for weapons. This statement is false. Enriched uranium can be used for energy. Perhaps a person could be a rare metal collector. Many dangerous chemicals are regulated even if they are not used for dangerous purposes. For example, special transportation needs to be considered for chemicals that are hazardous or explosive. The fact remains that drunk driving is a problem since one cannot voluntarily become sober. This is why it is treated differently from other issues as reading and driving, which is far less common. The best way to stop this would be to stop the drinking in the first place. It would be impractical to get rid of the car, since it is necessary for transportation. Drinking is unnecessary. C4) Alcohol related crimes 60% of all homicides are attributed to alcohol.[8] Imagine how many lives could be saved if the minimization law was 25. Even if this might ‘unfairly punish' some people, these people can wait until there 25 until they can drink. Many of our laws restrict certain age groups in participating in certain activities (ex: driving, voting, sex, etc.) based on statistics conducted on these age groups. Why should alcohol be any different? ==Rebuttal== R1) Con drops this case R2) Social lives There are alternative places for social gathering. Entertainment, mall, doing an activity (ex: golfing, paintballing, etc.), restaurants, etc. There are clubs that allow people under 21 to enter. I know from personal experience. With the demand to be social, businesses will create settings for social gatherings for people under 25. People rarely drink in moderation in social gatherings and I have shown above that drinking even in moderation is unhealthy. Con does not address that people under 21 also have social lives despite a minimization law already in place. R3) Career Opportunities I am correct that those of age 25 are unlikely to enter into a prestigious business deal. The average age of a CEO is 50[9]. Considering that it takes an average of 28 years to become a CEO, it seems very unlikely for someone with only a few years of professional experience will get involved in important business deals. Con states that business deals are domestic. Businesses are increasingly global [10] If the economic could progress during the times of prohibition, the positive effect on alcohol in business is minimal. This article shows how to build business relations. There is not one mention of alcohol [11]. R4) criminal justice or public health? I've shown ample evidence that making an act illegal is not only effective, but more effective then public health campaigns. R5) calling for help There are people who do not call for help. However, this number is still low. This point is moot unless Con proves that more lives are lost by people not calling for help than the amount of lives saved by the minimal drinking age law of 1984. I've shown, through plummeting drunk driving, minimum drinking age laws has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. R6) Risky behavior Binge drinking increases after the age of 21. My source states ""Rates of binge alcohol use in 2007 were 1.5 percent among 12 or 13 year olds, 7.8 percent among 14 or 15 year olds, 19.4 percent among 16 or 17 year olds, 35.7 percent among persons aged 18 to 20, and peaked among those aged 21 to 25 at 45.9 percent""[12] R7) No refute against claim that ""rights can bet taken away if pose threat to oneself and others"". Everyone is better off, and the resolution would result in diminished harm. Even if one disagrees with the parental principle, one at least agrees that the government has the right to protect others from harm, based on social contract theory. Conclusion: Almost all of my sources are peer reviewed journal that use the scientific methods as opposed to my opponent who uses mainly anecdotal and opinions. I have shown how the parental principle is effective in saving lives. Many people unnecessarily die at the hand of alcohol. This resolution could save many lives. Any benefit alcohol has is minimal compared to the unnecessary destruction it causes. http://tinyurl.com...[1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com...

74	S656d76d6-A85b5760f	2	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Detectableninjas Tournament: Free Museam Admittals	In this post I intentend to show you that museums should have free admittance. The cultural, creative, and educational value that can be gained from visiting museums should be allowed to everyone in our society.The Importance of MuseumsThere are many different types of museums including art, science, history, etc. The main purpose behind museums is to give a sense of knowledge and culture to the person visiting. People should not be denied the right to be more knowledgable about the society of the world around them. The Importance of Culture in SocietyCultural awareness creates shared ideals and behavioral patterns among a group of people. A sense of culture instills values into a person and into a society at large. What this creates is people who share common goals and work together to strengthen their community for the good of everyone at large. Everyone should have access to museums because they keep people educated about the history of the country and the current goals of a nation; and where they fit into that system.There are six main driving factors in a quality culture. Two of those factors are open communication and everyone having access to all information. [1] Charging a fee for museums rejects people from having these two values. An invaluable culture will create opposite mentalities, such as a need to do things for self- interest rather than helping those around you. What this leaves is a society full of people who are working against each other which tears the economy and country apart. Who Gets Shafted?Who gets the brunt end of the stick? Museums that charge fees will deflect poor people from entering the museum. Poor people are generally less educated than rich people, and these are the ones that are in the most need of a museum. Cutting people off from free education about their culture just encourages negative and self destructive behaviors. Every child has a right to free education, but we know that schools are limited in what they can teach.Schools teach from textbooks and follow strict guidelines. Interaction and a sense of interest becomes lost. Libraries are full of books with words and at most a couple of pictures. The internet can have tons of misguided information. Television watching is passive and is dependant on what the producer decides to put out there. Museums are the only form of education that is interactive with a person. A person can become physically engaged in what strikes them as interesting. Museums present information in a way that is more interactive for the person wishing to learn. They can choose which areas are of most interest to them, and spend their time engaging accordingly. A child has the right to this sort of education because it is more fulfilling to them. When a child is neglected of education, they go on to produce a subpar standard of living and working. They go on to commit cirms and have a lack of understanding about their role in society. This hinders society at large. 1. http://my.execpc.com...	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge

Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge

"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge

We'll have the same rules as that debate, only I'll include a section on foreign relations. First round is a general overview with some domestic policies My country is called Metropotamia, after my favourite proposition by Thomas Jefferson, and essentially forms the landmass of France, Germany, Czech Republic Spain, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden Slovenia, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and the UK; so it's basically a Post-Napoleonic Superstate. Capital city is Strasbourg, since it's centrally located and something of a hub. All languages retained, though inter-region dialogue is in Esperanto. Esperanto is taught in schools as well as current national languages. The System of Government is a decentralised democracy, a federal parliamentary republic. The country is divided up into the 'regionoj' (regions) of ĉefurbo (Greater Strasbourg), Francia (France, Andorra and Monaco), Britannia (The UK & Ireland), Frisia (Belgium, the Netherlandsand Luxembourg), Hispania (Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar), Germania (Germany, Denmark and Czech Republic), Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden and Finland), Alpania (Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) and Italia (Italy, Slovenia and Malta). Each is divided up into Napoleonic-sized departments, with the county systems in the UK & Ireland acting. The departments are known as 'komunumoj' (communes), each with a director, called a 'membro de la parlamento' (Member of Parliament) and is divided up into four 'Distriktoj' (Districts), each represented by a 'Distrikto Reprezentanto' (District Representative). The District Representatives take part in the regional government, based in Madrid, Rome, Paris, Antwerp, Manchester, Leipzig, Stockholm and Vienna for their respective regions. The Members of Parliament go straight to Strasbourg for government meetings via the high-speed train lines that exist between the capitals of all regions and significant urban communes. The Central Bank of Metropotamia governs monetary policy, and issues guidelines to the regional governments for fiscal policy. Each commune is designed to be part of a 'Sindikato' (Union) of communes that has one principle export group, such as the Union of the Loire, which is all of the communes that lie in the Loire Valley, has a principle export of wine. This should cover most of the goods, and the goods not produced can be imported from the rest of the world. There is a very limited private sector, one that is mostly concentrated into small to intermediate-sized businesses and is tightly regulated. There is no trading of stock, and no firm may have more than ten percent market power. The state provide universal healthcare, education, all transport except for cars, energy completely through wind, solar and hydro, heating for homes, all roads, museums, art galleries, telecommunication and fibre optic broadband all free of charge and available to all citizens. There are no private schools, and university education is provided for free. The government owns all industries apart from a few privately owned industries controlled by the Ministry of Enterprise, which decides which businesses are better privatised, and when to nationalise firms by purchasing it at market value. People still own property and land, but inheritance is taxed at a 99% rate above the equivalent of ""500,000 (about $750,000) in the currency of Metropotamia, the Valuto, divided up into 100 Cendoj. Social Housing is made available for any citizen in need, with an ensured excess stock of 50,000 houses to cope with demand shocks. Services provided by the government are continuously reviewed and upgraded to ensure the best provisions for all. Each citizen receives a Citizen's Income of the equivalent of ""6,000 (about $9,000), with ""3,000 (about $5000) per child unconditionally, which guarantees subsistence, as the only essential overheads are food and clothing.. Work is intended to supplement income, and salaries start at the equivalent of ""8,000 (About $12,000) on top of the Citizen's Income, or a ""6 (about $9.50) minimum wage. This is the only ethical way to guarantee that work is always better than welfare, and also encourages population growth. Citizens unable to work receive a Citizen's income of the equivalent of ""10,000, though it can vary depending on what their needs and means are. Citizens over the age of seventy receive the State Pension of the equivalent of ""7,500, in addition to their savings and work pension schemes. The state always has spare capacity - partly to attract migrants, and partly to ensure the strength of trade unions. A strictly secular society - no religious symbols to be worn in public spaces, no religious displays in public spaces, i.e. religious scenes in businesses or in public; and no religious advertising. No religions given tax-exempt status, religious law has no legal backing and no religion given priority over the other. No practices, such as baptism or circumcision, are to be performed on people unable to give informed consent. On censuses, no religion or race is noted, and country of birth is something that is disregarded at immigration and customs. Open doors immigration policy, for both economic migrants and asylum seekers. However, adult migrants who are still in their first year in the country are only entitled to the Citizen's income of a child until they are in a job earning at least ""8,000 per year, and children are given credits to spend on food and clothing for them, to ensure that they are not unprovided for. All drugs are legalised and regulated by the Ministry of Substances, as is alcohol and tobacco. Narcotics are purchasable with a substances account activated by fingerprint at a state-owned recreational pharmacy, which entitles each person to an amount for personal use similar to that in Portugal currently, once per week. Drugs are taxed heavily, meaning that their prices are as high as they currently are, but go through a quality control system to ensure that it is cut with non-harmful substances. Problem users can be blacklisted by the Ministry, and drug-related criminals are given free, compulsory rehabilitation. Drug dealing is still a crime. The minimum age for purchasing alcohol and cigarettes is sixteen, though consumption is legal from twelve. Taxation is very high, so as to provide for the extensive social programmes, but is progressive. Income that is not Citizen's Income up to ""8,000 is taxed at 10%, ""15,000 is taxed at 15%, ""20,000 at 20%, ""35,000 at %40, 50,000 at 60%, ""100,000 at 75% and above ""200,000 at 85%. The government ensures there are no millionaires, but bear in mind that although these incomes seem low, most essential services are provided by the government, and all pay is spent on consumer goods and services. Inheritance tax is exempt on money and property worth less than ""50,000; 50% on money and property worth under ""500,000 and 99% on property worth more than that. There is no tax on domestically produced goods, but varying tariffs exist for some imports. The consumption of fossil fuels is minimal, as the government owns the automotive industry and, thanks to increased investment in R&D, as well as the abolition of patents, manufactures driverless cars that use hydrogen fuel, and oil is used exclusively in plastics manufacturing. All oil comes from either the North Sea or from the Middle East, though it is limited due to the prevalence of the turning of coal into oil, and through the use of arboform The foreign policy is a mixture of interventionist and isolationist, though strictly pacifist. Negotiation and mediation is key to the foreign policy, and the United Nations meets in Strasbourg. Metropotamia never involves itself militarily in the wars of others; instead, it hosts peace talks and gives humanitarian relief to civilians. Because of this pacifist foreign policy, terrorism is very rare, and no foreign intervention is needed. Most dictators are there as a result of western foreign policy rather than the people of their own country, and therefore by refusing to support dictatorial regimes, Metropotamia could ensure there are no dictators. Spending on the military is minimal. The navy is stationed across the world, thanks to treaties with other countries that are receptive due to the dove foreign policy. It consists entirely of destroyers and patrol boats, which are there for anti-piracy operations, and to protect trade interests. The army is confined to a division in each regiono, and a large national guard/territorial army for security purposes only. The air force is limited to fighter jets, which are designed to deal with encroaching planes, and they have limited bombardment faculties to protect trade interests. There are no nuclear weapons, and there is only a domestic intelligence agency. It is a highly technological society, as technology compensates for mankind's flaws, and allows society to progress. There are hydrogen-powered cars widespread, high-speed trains prevalent, and advanced medical procedures and nanotechnology. This ensures Metropotamia's global dominance in the market, as well as improving the standard of living for all citizens."	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge
74	S656d76d6-A63ab0219	2	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Detectableninjas Tournament: Free Museam Admittals	CP1)Attendance would likely spike on free admittance days. This is true, but this demonstrates the effectiveness of these days in bringing in new museum patrons.2) Many museums already offer specific days that are free to the public. These museums generally do not expereience most of the problems you described, such as crowding to the point of turning away guests. Your arguments are largely empirically disproven. I have been to the Chicago Art Institute on free days on multiple occassions and have always had an enjoyable experience.3) The difficulty of having one extra busy day a month is vastly overshadowed bythe difficulty a 33% budget cut would pose. This is the alternative offered by removing ALL fees.4)While generally museums arent subject to excessive crowding, even museums WITH sometimes admission face problems of overcrowding. When an exhibit of Titanic artifiacts passed through the Chicago museums tickets were sold out for days. Highly attractive exhibits will always face the issue of limited amount of space for patrons to see the exhibit- this is an issue independent of free/cost admissions. The argument is non-unique and so is irrelevant.5)As I said earlier, free days ARE generally more crowded, but this creates an incentive for people who can afford it to pay for tickets on non-free days, maintaining museum revenue.6) One free day a month offers plenty of opportunity for people to attend museums. Given that most cities have more than one museum and that each month offers a new opportunity to attend a free day, it is unlikely that individuals would have schedules that prohibit museum attendance over the course of a year. If their schedule is that demanding, they arent going to be able to attend no matter what the admittance policy is.Cost1) My AAM evidence last round states that governments already fund 25% of museum costs on average. To suggest that the governement would increase their support by nearly 150% (going from funding 25% to 25+33=58%) in today's political climate of Tea Partiers, OWS, and demands for balanced budgets is absurd. Looking at the AAM evidence: There are roughly 850 million museum patrons each year and the average ticket costs 7 dollars. That means the government would be responsible for making up the cost of roughly 6 BILLION dollars in lost revenue.2) The Smithsonian budget increase represents a 4.5% budget increase on a small scale. This 36 million dollar budget increase to the smithsonian is about 0.6% of what would be required to cover lost revenue from admissions. Also note that in the wikipedia article it is stated that the Deficit Comission has RECOMMENDED ADMISSION FEES TO THE SMITHSONIAN. This clearly demonstrates that political will is looking to decrease museum reliance on govt funding, not increase it.3) Pro provides no evidence that at the door donations would be able to even come close to offsetting the billions in lost revenue. Keep in mind almost all museums are already funded significantly by private donations (35% per my AAM evidence). In order to maintain revenue, museums would have to double their private donation income. If they could do this, Im sure they already would be.OVERVIEWI have demonstrated that museums are heavily dependent on admittance fees for revenue. I have also shown that in today's political climate, these costs cannot be offset by government funding or by private donations. Given these facts, the removal of museum admittance fees would be a critical blow to our museum's ability to operate and maintain quality exhibits.As an alternative I suggested free admittance days, monthly days where museums are free to the public. This alternative captures Pro's benefits of open and free culture/education without fiscally devestating our museum system. My alternative strikes a balance between educational rights and economic feasibility. In affirming my alternative I negate the resolution.I must therefore urge the judges:Vote Con.

74	S22d6f2fd-Aa4d43613	2	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	People are wiling to pay, but do not	Compulsory admission charges were dropped by most British national museums in 2001. Since then, collection boxes have been placed asking people to make a voluntary donation. This is relatively passive and people will often walk by unthinkingly. However, when they have to pay for a special exhibit, they are more than happy to pay the compulsory charge. Museums are losing money by allowing people in for free when they would actually readily pay the money if asked more proficiently. These people would pay if the asking for a voluntary fee was more apparent, it is for this reason that a more intrusive voluntary charge is the way forward.	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge

74	S9db43fbd-Af4ffbd8c	2	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Free museums encourage attendance	In the UK, Labour government policy resulted in some of the leading national museums ending admissions charges. Their policy was in response to evidence from the 1980s that suggested museums that started charging visitors ‘saw their numbers plummet on average by a third – and never fully recover’ (Barrie, 2001). Labour’s policy shift had the effect of increasing visitor numbers greatly, proving that free entry is beneficial in increasing public exposure to culture. This can be shown by the UK having the highest number of visitors to art museums of any country based upon The Art Newspaper’s figures for top 100 visited galleries in 2010.(The Art Newspaper, 2011) Other countries should follow this example in order to draw more people into their own national museums.

Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, claims ‘it’s almost a moral duty that museums should be free’ (Smith, 2006). If museums are not funded sufficiently by the government, they will be forced to charge for entry, and this will inevitably deter many potential visitors, especially the poor and those whose educational and cultural opportunities have already been limited. Visitors to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London declined by 13% after it started charging for admission. Free access is essential to provide freedom of cultural and educational opportunity (Garrett, 2001).	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge

74	S7af8e1f1-A5cd38a99	2	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	free admission to art museums	"Thanks con for accepting this debate. As Aristotle once said, ""Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all. "" While things like logic and science educate our minds and teach us to think, There is one educational value that they don""t bring to the table and that is education for the heart. Art, On the other hand does educate the heart by giving the viewer feeling and emotion. It is an effective way to integrate emotion into education. A number of school systems can""t afford to fund art history as a stand alone course, Thus, It is up to museums to provide that sort of educational experience. Unfortunately, Many people simply do not have the financial ability to attend these museums because of the admission cost. They do not have the privilege to see and experience art because of finances. Their education for the heart is very limited. Because of this I am for the resolution, All art museums should have free admission. Observation 1: Definitions Free: Without cost or payment Art: the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, Typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, Producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. Admission: the process or fact of entering or being allowed to enter a place, Organization, Or institution. Museum: a building in which objects of historical, Scientific, Artistic, Or cultural interest are stored and exhibited. Source: Dictionary. Com Observation 2: Harms Harm 1: Admission fees cause art museum attendance to reduce dramatically. Support: Price is one of the biggest barriers to people attending museums. For example, If a family of six wanted to have a fun peaceful outing at an art museum and the admission fee was 18 dollars a person, It is going to cost them $100 and they might decide to go to a $42 movie instead. However, If we decided to make art museums free to attend, Most families would choose something free and educational rather than more screen time. Many museums that have altered their admission prices to make them free have experienced a substantial increase in their attendance. For example, When the Dallas Museum of Art put an end to their $10 admission fee, Their total annual attendance skyrocketed from 498, 000 visitors per year, To 668, 000 visitors per year. In addition, The museum experienced a 29% increase in their minority visitors. This isn""t the only museum that has had success with free admissions however. The Victoria and Albert Museum had a 113% increase in attendance when they made their art museum free. Finally, Several art galleries that eliminated their admission fees received a total of 6 million more visits than the year they had admission fees. This justs shows to prove that because a lot of families have financial issues, Free education in the form of art is very attractive to them. In spite of this, Art museums that are free to get into receive a lot more attendance than those that do have admission fees. Source 1: www. Independent. Co Source 2: www. Citylab. Com Harm 2: Putting high costs on admission fees excludes members of the lower class to exposure to creative art. Support: In our society, We have countless people that are talented and gifted in creativity. You will find some of these creative geniuses in the lowest class of our society. These people in particular do not have the financial stability to pay $75 every time their family visits an art museum or even once. In spite of this, These gifted people in the field of art are not obtaining proper exposure to art to inspire their gift. You see, All artists have an inspiration of some sort that urges them to go after their dream. That""s the beginning of where all creative artistry comes from. They are inspired by others works of art, And thus, They decide that that is what they want to imitate. From there, Their talent and natural gift in art does the rest. Some of our most well known artists were inspired themselves by works of art that came before them. For example, Did you know that Van Gogh only began using vibrant colors after exposure to other famous artists such as Gauguin, Monet, And Bernard? This ultimately resulted in one of this most famous paintings titled ""The Sunflower"" in which he used brighter, Vibrant colors in his art. One must wonder if this painting would have ever existed without the exposure of Monet, Gauguin, And Bernard. Are we as a society neglecting our own ""Van Gogh""s"" because we did not allow art to be accessible to them because of something as simple as admission fees? Is it possible that we are missing out on some of the greatest art the world has to offer? By putting unaffordable admission prices on art museums, You are shutting down the chance for countless people from the lower class to become what they are meant to be. Source: www. Artble. Com Harm 3: Limiting access to art education will result in lower SAT scores and less academic achievement. Support: Studies have found that exposure to art is directly correlated to positive child development, And higher SAT verbal and math scores. According to Catterall""s findings, Participation in art activities is an unusual, Yet accurate predictor of academic achievement and community involvement. Students with lower economic standing that gained art experience reaped the benefits of better grades, Employment, And even college attendance. If these students were just able to gain some exposure to art, The success rates in academic success, SAT scores, And employment will skyrocket. Source: thehill. Com Observation 3: Plan Mandates: The US will pass a law saying all art museums will have free admission Agency: The government Funding: Studies have shown that funding art museums through donations has proved a good, Reliable source of income. For example, The California Museum of Art received a total of 321 large donations totalling millions and millions of dollars. From this example, It is indubitably clear that because of the generosity of people, Art museums will have more than enough money to support themselves. After all, Because of the fact that admission fees only account for an average of between 2 and 4 percent of the museum""s overall income, Raising enough money through donations to cover that will not be an issue at all. Enforcement: Supreme Court Observation 4: Advantages Advantage 1: Art Museum attendance will skyrocket Support: If art museum admission is free, The public will be encouraged to attend them. No one, Especially members from the lower class, Will have to worry about finance issues, And they would get the exposure to art education that they need. Everyone in our society should have an equal opportunity to have art education, And achieve academic excellence, Even if they aren""t the richest. Source: www. Citylab. Com Advantage 2: No special talents will be missed Support: By granting everyone free access to art museums, You are ensuring that everyone, Rich or poor, Has an equal opportunity to be properly educated in terms of art. If someone, Especially from the lower class, Has the special talent of creativity, Art museums are the perfect way to make sure that it is discovered. Inspiration in art is all it takes for someone to uncover that special talent. Advantage 3: Success rates on the SAT and academic achievement will go up Support: Because many schools do not offer art as a class, Art museums are the perfect way to ensure that all students receive the proper art education they need to succeed academically. Exposure to art increases SAT scores, Improves community involvement, And greatly improves motivation to learn. Our society would be a completely different place if everyone had proper art education. Something as simple as art museum admission fees is the only thing keeping this dream from becoming a reality. Conclusion: In conclusion, I am for the resolution, All art museums should have free admission."	PRO	museums free charge	museum free charge
74	S11893e6b-A91ddcd84	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	Should the United States promote electric vehicles	Thanks for a great debate flamebreath. ==Conclusion== I’ll refute what seem to be my opponent’s voting issues and then move on to my own. My opponent’s voting issues: 1. Promote = advertisements (from Round 3) The government doesn’t need to “advertise” electric cars – the respective companies do that. Imagine how unfair and wasteful this would be. Imagine the government ran advertisements for Coke, rather than Pepsi. That’s unfair favoritism; the same is true if the government runs ads for the Chevy Volt. Car companies pay for ads anyway – why waste government funds. The only way the government can legally promote something is through subsidy. Using government funds to advertise for a private company is illegal. My opponent is changing his advocacy – he was clearly arguing for subsidies, not advertisements, in round 2. Don’t let him do this. 2. Electric cars are dependable and reliable News report: electric car spontaneously lights itself on fire in San Francisco. [1] Electric cars spontaneously shut down when hitting potholes or speed-bumps. [2] Electric cars don’t operate well in cold weather, and may not survive prolonged rainy seasons. [3] According to a recent consumer report, electric cars are so new that very few mechanics know how to repair them yet. The consumer had to take his car to an electric golf cart repairman and hope for the best. My opponent drops the National Cancer Institute study that the large magnetic fields in electric car engines cause cell damage and cancer. Sorry, I got the battery replacement cost wrong before – the other number was for hybrids. According to U.S. News & World Report, fully electric car batteries cost between $10,000 and $15,000 to replace. [4] You’re essentially buying half a car, again, every 20,000 miles. They can’t go more than 100 miles on one charge. They need a 220 Volt outlet to charge, which most homes don’t have. A good 220 Volt charger will cost $2000 to install. [5] 3. Electric cars need no new power plants His study looked at hybrids, not fully electric vehicles, which require far more power. His study assumed that the cars would all be charged at night; currently, most coal and natural gas power plants shut down or operate at lower capacity at night. It’s illogical for my opponent to draw the conclusion that no new power would be needed. Electric cars need power – period – and that power can’t come from thin air. His study assumes that dirty power plants, that would not normally operate at night, would start operating at full capacity 24/7. This would increase both pollution and cost, even if no new power plants were built. 4. Cost effectiveness Electric vehicles have triple the up-front cost and similar per mile cost to gasoline-powered vehicles, based on my analysis from the previous round. Accounting for electricity price increases due to increased demand, charging an electric car costs the equivalent of buying gasoline at $4.50 per gallon (I actually made a math error the previous round). 5. Environment Burning coal is more harmful to human health than burning oil (Princeton study). Switching from gasoline-powered cars to mostly coal-powered electric cars seems like a bad idea. My opponent fails to even prove that human-caused global warming exists. Reasons to vote Con in today’s debate. 1. All Vehicles My opponent fails his burden of proof. He has agreed to my definition of vehicle the entire debate as meaning “all forms of transportation” - including airplanes, boats, and motorcycles. Because he doesn’t prove that fully electric vehicles, across all categories of transportation, even exist, he cannot prove that they should be promoted. 2. Public transportation Subsidizing cars makes it more difficult for companies that operate buses, trains, ferries, and light-rail to compete. Mass transportation systems (buses, trains) are extremely more energy efficient than cars. Expending lots of energy to power a massive and heavy machine in order to transport only one person is very wasteful and inefficient. Considering that the roadways are falling into disrepair and desperately need $1.6 trillion in repairs, the time to switch to more public transportation is now. Conclusion: no new subsidies for cars. 3. No government funds My opponent never answers the argument that we have reached the $14.2 trillion government debt ceiling and cannot spend any new money (on subsidies), without specifying where the cuts would come from (according to new House budgetary rules). My opponent never specifies where the cuts would come from, so he would not be allowed to spend any new money, by law. Remember that the typical electric car costs three times as much as the combustion engine-equivalent of that vehicle. The government subsidy to make electric vehicles cost competitive would have to be massive. This isn’t a smart way to spend government funds. A better solution to global warming would be to fund research on methods to cool the globe, such as by blocking sunlight. One such solution is explained in depth in Superfreakonomics. 4. Crowds out alternatives When the government subsidizes one type of product, it makes it difficult for competing products to survive, since the subsidized technology is artificially cheap. This is why, in the US, healthy foods have trouble competing with junk foods made from ridiculously cheap, massively subsidized corn. Flex fuel cars only cost $100 more to manufacture. Hydrogen fuel cell cars are showing a great deal of promise. Clean diesel technology has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years. Cellulosic ethanol is the wave of the future Switchgrass is currently grown on marginal farmland to improve soil quality and is currently considered an agricultural waste product. Farmers often throw it away. Using this essentially free fuel source, the U.S. could replace two thirds of our gasoline usage by 2050, for only a marginal cost, according to the National Commission on Energy Policy. Conclusion: allow the free market to decide the winner, which it will inevitably do based on which technology is most cost-effective. 5. Lithium Dependence Car batteries are utterly dependent on Lithium, which is an even more limited resource than petroleum. According to Meridian International Research, “Analysis shows that a world dependent on Lithium for its vehicles could soon face even tighter resource constraints than we face today with oil.” We’ll be at the mercy of lithium-rich countries like Chile if we subsidize electric cars and create an over-reliance on them in the market. Prices will skyrocket as lithium deposits run out. This will make not just cars, but laptop computers and anything else that uses batteries, vastly more expensive. Conclusion: Don’t make us utterly dependent on lithium through government subsidies. 6. Grid overload According to Scientific American, the transformers that line every street cannot handle the increased power-load from electric car owners charging their vehicles every night. Adoption of electric car subsidies, without upgrading the grid, will result in rolling blackouts across the United States, as transformers begin shorting out. If we do upgrade the grid, this will be ridiculously expensive. Conclusion: the government should not promote electric vehicles through subsidy. Thanks all for reading. Vote Con!

Museums preserve and display our heritage and therefore should be accessible to all of the public free of charge	Not everyone wishes to visit museums, which are essentially a form of entertainment for the middle classes and tourists. The majority of adults never visit a museum, preferring instead leisure pursuits such as football, the cinema or clubbing. As Philippe de Montebello has wondered, if the public can pay for other events, ‘what is it about art that shouldn’t be paid for?’ (Smith, 2006) Why should they have to pay for their chosen entertainment while subsidising the generally wealthier middle class through their taxes? Tourists pay no taxes here and so gain a free ride at the expense of domestic taxpayers. The state provides educational opportunities for all through free schooling, which often includes free museum trips. If free museum entry were considered a cultural right, shouldn’t the state make theatre tickets free as well?	CON	museums free charge	museum free charge
74	S9fa9def5-A64942500	0	2	Should all museums be free of charge?	It's time for the workers of the world to unite	I would like to take this opportunity to welcome F-16_Fighting_Falcon to Debate.org and also to thank him for accepting this debate challenge. Firstly, comrades, I will reconfirm that I am referring to talking about workers of all countries, not just the UK, the struggle of the working classes to free themselves from the yoke of capitalist oppression is an international one and our goals can only be achieved at a global level. The issue of competition is relevant to businesses, but not public services. That's because the sole purpose of a private enterprise is to make a profit to be divided amongst its shareholders. Their customers are merely a means to that end: the object is to extract from them the maximum amount of money at the minimum of in order and clearly that corporate philosophy is not appropriate for the provision of public services, particularly to the most financially disadvantaged members of society. With regard to education and banks: there can still be competition but the reward will be promotion and pay rises for the employees of these establishments that improve standards and benefit society the most. Moving on, they say there's no such thing as a free lunch. Why would anyone donate substantial amounts of money to a political campaign? To gain influence with the politician once they are in power, of course. It is very unhealthy for democracy when the people with most influence in government are not the electorate but the corporations and high net worth individuals that fund their political party. The cost of funding election campaigns need not be high, and would represent a very small percentage of government expenditure, and what could be more important than protecting the democratic process from corruption? Regarding inheritance, this is a means whereby wealthy families are able to ensure future generations enjoy privileges and advantages over other children and young people. Those less fortunate are already at a social and economic disadvantage and their opportunities to reach their full potential in life are further restricted by not being able to access the best education or be able to afford to take internships that often are a pre-requisite the the best jobs. Taxing inheritance and using the money to fund education that will benefit all, not just the privileged few. The estates of people who choose to donate their wealth to charity upon the deaths, on the other hand, would not be subject to taxation. Libraries, galleries, museums and botanical parks belong to the nation and must be open to the public free of charge. Not all children have free access to the Internet and these educational facilities are important sources of knowledge and learning. It's is morally repugnant that only the children of the rich should have access to them. In conclusion, this socialist movement can only function on an international level: history has shown that it cannot succeed in isolation and that's why it is time for the workers of the world to unite to bring about a fairer, more egalitarian societies operating as meritocracies rather than as a collection of quasi-democratic laissez-faire capitalist regimes where the privileged few take all and the devil takes the hindmost.

However in your round one, it says you think it should be free to YOUNG people which is kind of contradictory saying that only people under 18 should go there free as you defined young people as anyone under 18. Here are my points why I think no.Point 1: How would they make money? If museums were free how would they pay their employees and pay the bills? The government? Where does the givernment get money? Taxpayers. Why waste perfectly good taxpayers money in a capitalist country where private agencies own most businesses. Private agencies ussually don't care unless it would be a good investment so they aren't going to give money to the museums unless there is a big sign outsides flashing neon orange saying ""Kept up and running by Mr. Almighty Inc"".Point 2: It should be only for 13 and under.I've been in many places where there is a certain age before you have to pay. I have not seen one place where it is free for under 18. Usually under 3, sometimes under 7, even less under 13, but never once under 18. When I go someplaces I end up paying an adult ticket because I'm over 13. By your teenage years a lot of that ""free"" kind of blows away.Point 3: Let the museums decide.If it is a privatly owned museum, let them decide how old you are until you have to pay. Imagine if you are a museum owner struggling to make a meager profit and now you ldon't get money you get from people between the ages 3-17. To you!"	CON	museums free charge	museum free charge

"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"

80	S5be89fb-A3ffc6d8d	2	2	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyberbullying that is held outside of school should be punished by the school.	Cyberbullying is an online form of bullying where the bully attacks another person through social media or text messaging. It is not simply two people joking back and forth, but an ongoing harassment that degrades the one being threatened. Cyberbullying generally happens outside of school and will carry on into the next school day. Most people tend to sway to the idea of keeping cyberbullying away from school because it does not happen there. Schools are responsible for a healthy learning environment, and bullying of any kind impedes on this process. It disrupts the school environment and takes a class or student away from learning. Although this is true, it is important to focus on cyberbullying because it could be hurting the child in many ways. For example, in the case of Amanda Todd. She committed suicide because of cyberbullying. She was bullied for many years and then went to the extreme lengths of ending her life. She moved schools many times to try and escape the bullying but none of the schools helped and moving didn't either. This bullying occurred off campus, but affected Amanda Todd at school. Since it affected her school life as well as her personal life the school should have been involved.	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S1deb845c-A2dc63d3	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Further steps need to be taken on social networks to stop cyberbullying.	"Resolved : Further steps need to be taken on social networks to stop cyberbullying. First, a welcome to PartyHeart for joining DDO and putting forth a thoughtful and non-trivial debate. Second, some things need to be clarified to understand the rebuttal. P1) Cyberbullying is harmful and needs to stop. This is absolutely true, harassing other individuals, either in real life or through the internet is wrong. This would be defended because for one it is illegal and two it is immoral. It is illegal as there are quite a number of harassment laws and it is clearly causing suffering to a conscious agent and thus by the objective morality advocated by Sam Harris in ""The Moral Landscape""it is obviously immoral [1]. Now if we both agree that cyberbullying it is illegal and immoral, or in short just wrong then how can it be advocated that social networks do not need to take further steps to stop it? In short, the rebuttal will consist of two main contentions : C1) There is a huge difference between bullying in real life and over the internet. On the internet you can close the web browser, you can block users, you can simply go to another site. This is not the case in real life where a child going to school can simply and trivially go to another class, or at work a co-worker getting harassed can just move to another project. In these cases the individuals are constrained to be where they are and have to endure the harassment. This needs to be kept in mind as in those cases the principal agents (school, employer, etc.) have to take a much more active role in securing the environment. However even in these cases the victim has to escape the mentality of being a victim and this leads directly to the second contention. C2) The individuals need to take responsibility, understand what bullies are doing, why they are doing it and how to combat it. As Stephen Covey advocates in the ""Seven Habits of Highly Successful People"", the very first step is ""Be Proactive"". Recognize that if you let your happiness placed in the hands and more importantly decisions of another then it will be forever be beyond your grasp. Specific to the topic at hand, consider the following blurb : Bullies seek out victims who appear to: Be unable to defend themselves; Have little social support, few friends; Be uninvolved in extra-curricular activities; Be among the low achievers in academics or sports; Not be popular or focused on by adults in the school; Have less developed social skills; Have difficulty communicating, especially in stressful situations; and Avoid being noticed or be unassertive. [2] Again to be clear the argument here is not that bullying is ok, but it is that the victim can act themselves to solve the problem by understanding what the bully is trying to achieve and act accordingly. The victims do not need to see themselves as powerless, they do not need to look always for others to solve this problem, they can take control of the situation and move forward themselves and resolve it. Now what is the reason for taking this approach, why put the responsibility on the participants and not on the social networks? On the face of it this appears to be unfair, why make the victim the one that is responsible? The perspective is simply, that is the way that they gain, it is a way for them to turn the situation around, for them to make a positive and gain, to grow and develop character. Here is what Coral Milburn Curtis had to say, who has for 35 years been teaching kids in African townships and throughout rural England : Children who are confident have a head start in life. They are: Able to accept and learn from their own mistakes Confident without being arrogant or conceited Not demoralised by criticism or mild teasing Able to deal with their own feelings Not easily upset by setbacks or obstacles Unlikely to feel a need to put others down Assertive but not aggressive in communicating their needs Not too worried about failing or looking foolish More likely to resist peer pressure Able to bounce back from disappointments and failures Able to cope with change Able to say 'No', without offending the other person Bullies avoid people with a strong sense of character. Building up your child's self-esteem is going to impact on his/her ability to manage life's ups and downs, not only at school, but at work, in the family and in relationships. The earlier you start the better. Strengthen your child's self-confidence and you will be helping him/her along the path to success.[3] This method of strengthening the victim and in fact removing the victim mentality from the individual has been growing in momentum steadily through programs such as ""Take a stand""[4] as people have come to realize that adding more and more layers of engineering controls to the administration is simply not helping. Again to be clear, this is not an approach to blame the victim, but it is simply an approach, even recognized and advocated by the Mayo Clynic[5] to empower the individual, to show them that they can be more than the situation and in fact to even reverse the roles and put them in the position of power where they are the ones that are confident and secure. In summary, websites which are used for social networking do obviously have to have reporting features, such as DDO has for reporting inappropriate behavior, and these need to be monitored and any illegal activity should be reacted to with appropriate measures. This would be done to protect the company from liability more so than anything else. However, to truly move out of the role of the victim, the individuals who are harassed need to take responsibility, come to understand why they are being so targeted, deal with than and take control of their lives.

My opponent and I will pass on round 5 and conclude the debate in the fourth round.That being said, let us begin.I will use this round for opening arguments.Definitions.1. Cyber Bullying: ""Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place using electronic technology. Electronic technology includes devices and equipment such as cell phones, computers, and tablets as well as communication tools including social media sites, text messages, chat, and websites. Examples of cyberbullying include mean text messages or emails, rumors sent by email or posted on social networking sites, and embarrassing pictures, videos, websites, or fake profiles."" I feel this to be a comphrehensive enough definition. https://www.stopbullying.gov... 2. Big: ""large in size: large in number or amount: involving or including many people, things, etc."" http://www.merriam-webster.com... 3. Issue: ""something that people are talking about, thinking about, etc. : an important subject or topic"" http://www.merriam-webster.com... Contentions.1. Cyber Bullying causes suicide.According to cyberbullyhotline.com, Sam Laird posted a mashable article with these statistics on cyberbullying. ""42% of teenagers with tech access report being cyberbullied over the past year. Of the 69% of teens that own their own computer or smart phone, 80% are active on social media. The average teen sends 60 texts per day - reducing face-to-face communication skills. Teen texting rate is DOUBLE the adult texting rate. Girls 14-17 text more - 100 per day. 7.5 million Facebook users are under 13 years old. 81% of teens say bullying online is easier to get away with. 3 million kids per month are absent from school due to bullying. 20% of kids cyberbullied think about suicide, and 1 in 10 attempt it. 4500 kids commit suicide each year. Suicide is the No. 3 killer of teens in the US. (Car accidents #1, Homicide #2)"" http://www.cyberbullyhotline.com... There are a couple conclusions that can be drawn from this article. First, the article is pointing out how many teens are active on places where cyberbullying is rampant. Also it is important to keep in mind that out of these millions of active teens, some of them are cyber bullies themselves. But the statistic of this contention, is that 4500 kids successfully commit suicide every year over being cyberbullied. Suicide is NOT ACCEPTABLE. If it occurs and it could have been prevented, then someone was not paying attention to the problem. The problem, is cyberbullying itself. If we try to call a problem not a big deal, then we fall into the trap of ignoring it and letting it rule us. That is why the resolution must be negated.2. Cyber bullying is a very large part of the internet, therefore it is a big issue. ""BullyingUK saw calls relating to cyberbullying increase by 77% over a 12 month period. Cyberbullying can and does have a seismic effect on the families concerned. In an online survey, BullyingUK also found that 43.5% of respondents aged between 11 and 16 had been bullied via social networks. 51% felt that blocking the bully from further contact or communication was a vital tool."" http://www.independent.co.uk... This quote should help illustrate this. Keep in mind this is just the UK. Not even the United States. Also notice that all these kids want the bullies completely blocked from communicating with them. This is because the issue has gotten out of control. No one seems to know how to control it reasonably anymore. The reason for that, is because Anonymity makes Cyberbullying easier than ever. So it is difficult to cut off contact.In light of this, clearly, Cyberbullying is a growing issue, and one that is not small enough that an everyday person can easily ignore it.3. Cyberbullying has become a popular sport.On YouTube, there is a YouTuber named Leafyishere. He posts videos essentially roasting and bashing anyone. It can be kids, old people, or other YouTubers. All he does is find a video, and relentlessly and ruthlessly destroy his subject in a verbal assault. Because this is electronic communication, Leafy is a cyberbully. He is also someone who is subscribed to by almost 3.7 million people. He doesn't even make content that is about a subject. Instead he is a reactor to others content, and he only finds faults 98% of the time. I don't feel comfortable linking his channel because I don't wish to endorse him.He is an example of how people think that sending hate on the Internet has become a sport or a funny game. But when 4500 people die because of it, IT IS NOT A GAME. This is serious stuff, and therefore the issue is big.Once again, the resolution is negated.4. Finally in a quick response to sum up my opponent.My opponent so far is purporting the age old argument of ""grow up"" to people affected by Cyberbullying. Here is why that argument is faulty. Words have impact, and hateful words have more impact than positive ones. This is why Cyberbullying cannot be an issue that is ignored. Now let me clarify something. I am not saying that ignoring bullies is a bad idea. In fact in face-to-face bullying situations, as long as serious physical abuse is not happening, ignoring bullies is the best thing to do. But the reason for this is that when someone is ignored in person, it affects them much more than over the internet. This is because humans express complex emotions in person that are not brought to life through a keyboard or video camera as easily as in person. This fact means that when someone is Cyberbullied, they feel helpless agains the bully because they cannot ignore them and make the problem go away. That victim may be the frustration vent for the angry person on the other end who is the bully. And if they are using that person as a frustration vent ad infinitum, then what can the victim do? Certainly not ignore it if their phone is blowing up. They need their phone for constructive conversations. But they also cannot fix the issue because the person can simply create fake profiles and stalk that person again. So clearly, it is not a solvable issue on the surface, and for those who are not that mature or smart, it can be a devastating situation where suicide feels like the only option. Therefore I would ask my opponent to be less insensitive to human life, and respect that people die over this issue.With that I rest my case and eagerly await my opponent's responses.- 42"	CON	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	Sccc13722-A41c0f81f	1	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Internet anonymity increases cyberbullying and trolling	In normal social life, people restrain themselves in what they say to others. When anonymously online, people behave differently: whatever they say and do can be said and done without consequence, because it isn’t traceable to them as persons, or, as comic artist John Gabriel is often paraphrased 'Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Idiot’.[1] The consequences of this behaviour are ugly or downright harmful. Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games (MMPORGs) like World of Warcraft face a constant atmosphere of verbal abuse created by their players.  And there’s worse than simple trolling like this: anonymity increases the effects bullying. For example, where schoolchildren originally were bullied in schools by bullies whose faces they knew, with online anonymity the bullying goes on anonymously online and invades every aspect of the victims’ lives – aggravating their suffering so much that in some cases they actually commit suicide, as for example did Canadian teenager Amanda Todd.[2] That’s why organizations maintaining online communities, whether they be social networking sites like Facebook, MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and newspaper sites like The Guardian should (legally) be required to (publicly) verify the person behind an account or take it offline if it remains anonymous, as New York senators recently proposed.[3] [1] The Independent, ‘Rhodri Marsden: Online anonymity lets us behave badly’, July 14, 2010.

80	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind. This kind of sacrifice makes us heroic; This kind of sacrifice is nee"	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S2201b5c9-A31ebfe82	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	should cyberbullying be taken seriously	"There are quite a few questions i have for you seeing that we both have opposite views on the subject. But first i would like to make some things clear. 1. You make a good point therefore for this rebuttal i will not bring in any examples. It will all be fact and logic 2. I will not make any personal attacks against you and not because i believe i am above you but simply to make my point stronger. Which towards the end of your argument you did simply make some guesses at my person when you could have made your argument stronger. 3. I want you to know that i am willing to admit defeat if you make a response that i simply have no answer for. I will now begin dissecting parts of your argument. First, how does my beginning statement shun my case. Because my case is people are way too sensitive and that there are worse things in the world than cyberbullying. Second, when you mention its not worth the energy to save someone from depression, yes it is worth it if they actually have a good reason to be depressed. Because people should not be depressed from insults. the second part, is it worth the energy to save someone from suicide, no, its not, its they're choice to kill themselves. It is instinctually programmed into almost every living thing to keep itself alive. So the people who commit suicide are going against they're instincts and for what? Because they're not strong enough to handle a few insults? Third when you talk about disregarding cyberbullying as an issue and people eventually thinking its okay to bully. First no, cyberbullying is not an important issue because taking an insult is not an important issue. That is called a get over it and move on. Second people would not think that its okay to bully. It would be the exact opposite because people will know that nobody cares there would be less bullying and more people getting over petty insults. 4. I dont understand how you dont find any reasons for why cyberbullying dosent matter. my primary point is, there are worse things in the world than cyberbullying. I thought i made that very clear, i gave at least 3-4 examples. 5. You mention what will happen ""down the line"" have you ever thought that ""down the line"" people will realize how petty cyberbullying really is? 6.you say cyberbullying is not what i propose. Yet, you have not showed me that cyberbullying is any different than what i think. Another thing that i thought was very clear was that cyberbullying is nothing but dumb cause and even dumber effect. Which i truly dont feel the need to elaborate on. 7. You make a good point, we should not totally ignore cyberbullying. We should make it so that people realize how stupid and petty cyberbullying really is. 8. You say that cyberbullying is mentally alarming, to the weak. Yes i said it some people in this world are simply weak and there is no way around it. Whether its their fault or not there will always be weak people. 9. You mention how the online bullying can lead to real fights. Most news articles that I've read ( yes i have actually read some cyberbullying articles) do not mention anything about physical violence. Find me 3 articles where cyberbullying lead to physical bullying but until then, i dont care. 10. So me pointing out what actually happens in life is proof of my personal issues? Why would i disregard it from my argument? As i said before the whole statement was about how there are much more important issues in the world. 11. Finally your end paragraph where you mostly guess at the type of person i am and insult me. But there is one point you made. About my stereotypical thinking of what cyberbullying is. Once again you have not showed me that cyberbullying is anything more than what i think it is, a bunch of wimps complaining about people calling them mean names. That is simply not how a debate works, you cant point to a problem and complain about it without giving a solution. And by the way with the insults. This is a debate not a youtube comments section. You say that im a cruel person but im simply giving information that i have seen. And i have not seen or heard from anything involving cyberbullying that has made me think ""wow, what a sad and depressing cyberbullying article"" You continue to defend people who commit suicide, why? Its they're choice its none of our business if they get stupid and decide to kill themselves. Because i dont understand how someone could kill themselves like that, are they going to die from getting called mean names? Because suicide only comes down to 2 things 1. Are you going to die or suffer? 2. How long will the suffering last Because with cyberbullying is a person miles from you saying mean things. So how long will it be before these idiots get over it. But i came up with the perfect solution. Are you ready? Its very complicated..... Dont go to that website anymore. Really because those are your 2 choices. Leave that site or toughen up and get over it. And those of you who read this will probably think that im some sort of demon for saying this but. Sometimes i will watch those cyberbullying suicide videos and laugh. Yes, i sometimes laugh at how idiotic and weak people can be Cant wait to see your reply."

"" I do know that mental disorders come from bullying, and that some may even develop from cyberbullying...""- In this line I did mention that SOME MAY even develop from cyberbullying. Some people may develop depression from work, or school, or friends- meaning that many things cause mental disorders or sickness, I was just recognizing that YES its POSSIBLE that some may have been caused from cyberbullying. I agree that I should have worded my claims better, and I will keep that in mind for the future. Your argument that "" If you're getting harassed by people online and you delete the account and make a new one, there will still be people out there who will find your new account and keep harassing you."" is not valid considering that no, not always will people keep searching for your new account.

80	S469b1ab-Accd51bc7	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Women in combat	"I'm going to rebut some of the things CON's said, and then offer some closing remarks. It's been fun, Russian! CON calls my rebuttal biased. Well, obviously. This is a debate, and I'm making a case. The question of the hour, however, is who the judge thinks should win. CON has lost the point on combat readiness, because I've offered sufficient evidence that some women are physically capable of serving which he cannot disprove. Even if it is the case that most women would not be able to meet the physical demands of combat, that is not a reason to exclude ALL women from combat as CON seeks. If some women are just as able as men, why should they not serve? CON's reasoning is pretty simple: women should not be in combat because women cannot handle combat -and yet he's offered no reason why women are uniquely unsuited for combat then men. I'm sure that some women probably couldn't, as I know many men can't -because combat is something that would take a huge physical and psychological toll on anyone. CON has furthermore in no way shown that women are emotionally unprepared to fight in combat than men, and his patriarchal argument about women's being predisposed to mood swings is sexist and offensive. What CON hasn't done is offer any reason why women are uniquely unsuited for combat, and why only men are. Moreover, CON concedes that at some women (perhaps less than 8% of all women) want to serve in combat -which is especially striking given that CON would like to paternalistically prevent them from serving their country. When he brings up estrogen levels, he has no warrant for why estrogen makes women unsuited for combat. When he talks about sex, he is assuming that men are not already sexual beings. Even in the absence of women, men still do all kinds of sexual things. For example, male on male sexual assault in the military is staggering. Indeed, ""more men than women were victims of sexual assault"" by male assailants. (1) To his other example about women on submarines, that problem is avoided by requiring women who serve in combat positions to take birth control. Upon evaluating the preponderance of evidence, women are less of a sexual problem in the military than other men! As such, CON's argument that women should not serve because they are going to sexually distract men is moot. In closing, I want to reiterate my two central points: women are able to serve in combat roles, and it is in the military's best interest to have them serve, as such. No one is suggesting that we lower the standard for qualification for combat roles. Rather, I am only arguing that those women who can meet the current standard should be allowed to serve. CON has no response to either of those points, just as he has no evidence that women are uniquely unable to serve in combat roles. He has also failed to in any way meaningfully counter the argument I cited from William Denn, an Army captain and intelligence officer who led soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a graduate student in public policy at Harvard""s Kennedy School of Government, that allowing women to serve in combat positions would actually strengthen the military because of the unique level of social sensitivity that women would bring to the modern battlefield. Indeed, bringing women into combat roles ""could mean the difference between a mission""s success or failure, with lives in the balance."" (2) Many thanks again to all judges. Do vote PRO.

80	Sb0f677c9-Aa3dbe798	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: Cyberbullying should be a criminal offence.	"I thank Pro for this debate. Pro listed his points and gave sources but did not specifically site the sources in his argument. I cannot find which source pertains to which fact. The sources themselves are fine, but please list them next to the facts they cover or list numbers so I can see which is which. I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to find the specific claims. FULL CON POSITION: Bullying needs to be addressed by legislation, cyber or otherwise, but not with criminal sanctions. I submit the model law given by the Anti Defamation League as a good law dealing with K-12 students and submit that current laws dealing with assault, harassment, libel, and slander already address the matter concerning adults without risking invalidation by possibly prohibiting free speech; therefore, no new laws are needed. http://www.adl.org... (Model law on actual p. 11. PDF p. 13) Support: I agree with Pro that cyberbullying is bullying, plain and simple. A bully should not find safety from punishment because a statement was made via texting instead of shouting it outside. Such a distinction would be silly and I can't make it with a straight face. My position is that neither action be criminally punished if it is not already encompassed by existing laws. I agree with contention one for the most part. Contention two on the other hand is not supported by the evidence offered. I have found no meaningful studies showing that criminal sanctions have curbed bullying. Tennessee (my state) has a cyberbullying law with criminal sanctions http://www.commercialappeal.com... http://techliberation.com... The law was given a good grade from this watchdog group. http://www.bullypolice.org... I have not found one prosecution. Not one. So, in Tennessee we have this high rated law with no one in jail or fined (at least I can't find one). What good is it? The law is probably unconstitutional and for this reason prosecutors are not using it and are, instead, using other existing laws concerning libel, harassment, slander, etc that have passed constitutional tests (concerning adults) and are allowing for the schools to deal with bullying with children. The criminal sanctions do not appear to have done anything other than discourage prosecutors from using the law. This result is not desirable if curbing bullying is the goal. As support for his contention, Pro linked a story concerning a program in Philadelphia. The program uses the local community and education to help prevent bullying. Where are the criminal sanctions? This program uses better recourses (schools, students, teachers, parents) than say hand cuffs, police, and prisons. As the Con position, I support these programs that allow for measures to be taken outside the criminal law as they appear more effective. I see nothing in this article suggesting the bullying stopped because of criminality. As a matter of fact, PA does not have a criminal sanction in its cyber bullying law. http://www.cyberbullying.us... And the law appears to be effective. http://www.pottsmerc.com... Pro's source serves as an example of good legislation that does not include criminal sanctions. It does nothing to support his contention that criminality is needed, or even desired. Many of the criminal cyberbullying laws are redundant and overly broad. http://www.theatlantic.com... And provide reactionary, rather than proactive, solutions. http://news.discovery.com... In his third contention Pro wishes to separate cyber bullying from bullying because the effects are more permanent, sometimes. The fact that cyber bullying leaves no physical marks like a punch or a kick does not distinguish it from any emotional bullying done without electronic devices. The latter can be harder to see but we are not attempting to distinguish mental and emotional bullying from physical bullying, at least, not in this debate. Not all cyber bullying is permanent per se; in some cases, it is easier to deal with. I can't keep Joe Blow from telling me that I am a horrible person, but I can delete his text message. I believe Pro is referring to items like blogs, facebook and videos. The latter areas are already covered by a variety of laws more severe than any cyber bullying laws I have read. To continue with Tennessee, we don't need a cyber bullying law because we have a more stringent law in harassment and stalking. http://www.mytennesseedefenselawyer.com... http://www.haltabuse.org... Any activity that rises to this level need not be defined as cyber bullying or even bullying for that matter and a new law made. We have several laws with more severe punishments already and they are simply harassment, stalking, libel, slander, etc. The risk of bringing lower levels of activity into the realm of the criminal law is that the people best able to handle it are removed from the equation and we over burden the courts with silliness. I am offering a better solution than criminality: Education for school age children, parents and school officials: Bust the myth that activities conducted off school grounds cannot bring sanctions from the school. Schools have a long reach and many of the current laws on bullying extend this reach to allow administrators to protect students off campus, without criminal sanctions. Parents and students may not be aware of these rules so the school is not contacted. http://fourriverscharter.org... See 2.C.i. Education for law enforcement: The police need to take this stuff seriously. As soon as harassment, online or otherwise, fits criminal activity, go after them. If the activity does not, contact the schools in the case of minors. For adults, show them the proper means of getting a restraining order. Yes, facebook activity can violate a restraining order. http://mashable.com... http://abcnews.go.com... (No need to use the cyber bully statute since we already had a good law barring this behavior) Education and awareness are the big ones here. Adding a law with criminal sanctions that is rarely used is a nominal effort at best. Tennessee, as well as other states, presented a knee jerk law that will probably fail the first time it is used. Pro said that ""nothing will be achieved if cyber bullying isn't a criminal offense"". I disagree. Making a nominal criminal law to respond to already illegal activities while risking Constitutional stonewalls is achieving nothing. ""In light of these concerns, perhaps legislators should abandon the knee-jerk criminal legislation in favor of a more creative approach to cyberbullying. One such method would focus on prevention."" http://blogs.vanderbilt.edu... I agree. Prevention and education, as presented by the ADL, is a much better solution than criminal sanctions."

80	S9ea5ac3e-A8891f7eb	0	0	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyber bullying isn't really that big of an issue	"Hello there, today I will be doing another new argument. As you can tell by the title, it's about how cyber bullying is honestly not a big deal and won't seriously affect your life. Here's why, -Most of the time when someone cyber bullies you, they don't even know you in real life -Most of the time Cyber Bullying is literally just calling someone curse words or just insulting them in a very cliche'd and repetitive way. -Most of the Cyber Bullying videos say how Cyber Bullying can effect your life. But most of the ways they portray this is pretty idiotic. They even think that Cyber Bullying can make you commit suicide? Unless if your a little 2 year old baby, then your probably aren't going to be affected at all at cyber bullying. Also if you seriously don't want to get cyber bullied, then all you have to do is not post some idiotic content on the internet and pretty much just don't act like an idiot. Which means just act like a normal person. -Now some cyber bullying can occur around school. The way that people picture cyber bullying at school is basically like this; ""OMG ALICIA IS LIKE SUPER DUMB LIKE OMG"" Then the people who make anti cyber bullying videos think that everybody at school is really dumb and that there going to randomly think now that Alicia is Dumb. I'm sorry but this is not how the world works. -There are even some people who dare to even compare cyber bullying to getting BEAT UP. I mean PHYSICALLY INJURED. Why would you even compare those two in the first place? No, just stop. I seriously have no idea why there even doing this. -People take cyber bullying so seriously and think of it as a really huge problem. I'm sorry but there are much bigger problems in our world like hunger, poverty, terrorists, global warming, and depletion of natural resources. I don't think cyber bullying is even close to being compared to these ACTUALLY IMPORTANT problems. Well here's my opinion. Nonetheless, I wish the opponent good luck."

80	S657f4fee-A21d9e4c0	0	0	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Story Challenge: Moat Maiden	"I would like to introduce an exercise (story challenge) in which PRO and CON incrementally develop what, in the end, becomes an interactive short story. This is probably best explained through an example. After the example are a few parameters, to which compliance is implicit in accepting this ""debate"". Following that, I present the Round 1 opening to Moat Maiden. Note that the rounds can be brief. Think Groo meets MacGyver. -- Noel Leon /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 1 -------------------- This is not quite a safari, in not quite a canoe. For my budget river rafting, a kayak has to do. From origin to terminus, I'd paddle fast and free. That was until around the bend, got stuck in this eddy. The vortex spins my river craft, yet grips it fast in place. To sink for lack of towing force, to vanish without trace. 1 The kayak is spinning. The compass is spinning. My head is spinning. And all the counter-paddling to put an end to this spinning is very tiring. What is the best first step? Swim to rocks and climb > Swim into the cave at the river bend Paddle more furiously Reason: Already tired from fighting the current, the cave seems to be the closest refuge for rest. Result: Swimming through the eddy, I enter the cave and clamber onto a rock. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 1 -------------------- 2 Development: There, while panting for breath, I give the cavern a cursory glance and see evidence of inhabitation. > Eat the charred food in fire-pit Wrap myself in the bearskin beside the fire Venture further into the cave Reason: No doubt the protein will provide needed energy. Result: Anyway, whatever it was, it tasted like chicken. Instinctively licking my fingers, I extend them to the fire-pit. /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 2 -------------------- 3 Development: Flame flickers between the stacked logs, providing a modicum of radiant heat. Run up and down a nearby rock outcrop to warm up Return to kayak for a change of clothes > Shift the front log with the stick Reason: Removing the front log exposes the hottest glowing region. Result: This increased infrared radiation soon dries my clothing. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 2 -------------------- 4 Development: The firelight also reveals a stack of rocks like stairs at a far end of the cavern and shifting shadows on the near side of the cave. Go toward the light > Listen for footfalls Run to the kayak Reason: Shadows suggest a possible intruder. Result: Actually, I would be the intruder to the cave dweller who ambles in, apparently without detecting me. /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 3 -------------------- 5 Development: The cave dweller falls asleep in the bearskin at mouth of cave. Run to the kayak Talk with the cave dweller > Tip-toe to the outcropping Reason: With the front entrance blocked, the only other exit may be up the stack of rocks. Result: At the top of the sedimentary staircase is a thatch mat. Tossing back the covering of straw and sticks, I catch a glimpse of the dweller catching a glimpse of me. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 3 -------------------- 6 Development: With renewed energy, I heave myself up and onto an embankment. On the other side of the river is a tree hut. Beat chest and shout like Tarzan Leap into the Ruddy River > Swing on the dangling vine Reason: Vine travel worked for Tarzan and might work for me. Result: Kicking off the rock holding the inclined vine, I grab on and swing over the river. /-------------------- Worked Example: PRO Round 4 -------------------- 7 Development: To prevent the dweller doing likewise, I have presence of mind to keep hold of the vine, which now dangles down to the forest floor. My presence at the hut upsets some chimps, however. They throw coconuts and, yikes, feces. Throw some (coconuts) back Pretend to eat a banana > Slide down the vine Reason: The vine dangling to the ground offers rapid escape, much like a fire fighter sliding down a station-house pole. Result: I land beside the river, just out of reach of the eddy-entrapped kayak. Some simians projectiles, mostly vine and coconuts, have preceded me. /-------------------- Worked Example: CON Round 4 -------------------- 8 Development: Simian screeches are getting louder as they reposition. I don't want to grapple with an excrement attack. Make a coconut slingshot with vine Jump into river and swim to kayak > Grapple with a coconut and vine instead Reason: A broken coconut tied to a vine makes an adequate grappling hook. Result: Like a cowpoke with a restless lasso, I swing it around and drop the coconut in the kayak. Development: Pulling the craft out of the eddy and to shore, I am soon safely bearing down-current. \------------------------------ End of Example ------------------------------/ Here are the parameters mentioned. PRO Round 1 introduces the verse and first situation. The verse sets the role and goal (e.g., jungle river rafter / free kayak from eddy). Each situation develops the story in first-person perspective to the point of three choices, identifies the best choice and reason why it is best based on clues in the story, and then gives the result of selecting that option. PRO and CON collaborate in creating credible predicaments paced so that the solution comes naturally (without a great leap of plot) as the development in CON Round 4. PRO and CON compete (try to win the ""debate"") by composing situations that are more interesting, evenly paced, and intriguing than those composed by his or her adversary. The aim is not to trip up the other author (e.g., with abrupt or inconsistent transitions), but to contribute more compelling content through cohesive narrative and clever puzzle-making. OK, on to PRO Round 1 of the story that we will develop. This is the first of three story challenges. All take place with a vaguely medieval level of technology. 1: Moat Maiden. In a clearing in an otherwise dense forest. Here, a square moat surrounds a cottage. 2: Cottage Cart. Crossing the moat, in the cottage the maiden sits beside a stack of woven cloth. 3: Snow Stopper (might be called Court Yarn). In the village courtyard, the Reeve seeks aid in preventing an avalanche. ~~~ MOAT MAIDEN ~~~ Help me, cries the angry maiden, across the murky moat. Vandals destroyed the old footbridge, and even stole my boat. Don't try to jump or even vault, its far too wide to leap. Ten paces wide on every side, and icy water deep. Perhaps there is a strong ladder, to use as if a bridge. Careful of the alligators, below the slimy ridge. 1 The maiden pleas but is otherwise unhelpful and here I've nothing but an empty sack. A nearby wooden shed is a weathered shell of its former self. What is the best first step? Climb the apple tree for a better vantage Follow the flickering light from copse to the north > Peek inside nearby shed, weathered shell of its former self Reason: Whatever raw materials are around, that shed might contain tools for crafting them. Result: A cursory survey, however, reveals only a rusted long-handled shovel, a hefty plank about 1 pace by 8 paces, and an old boot recently the home of a rodent family."

80	S41078143-A5347faa1	2	2	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: cyberbullying should be a criminal offence	"I'd like to thank my opponent for creating this very interesting topic. I debated against him a little while ago (http://www.debate.org...), so now I'm here for the rematch! In my opening speech I will outline the problem we are facing, and my model. Then I will address some of my opponent's advance criticisms of this model, and present two firm principles that present a clear conclusion: That cyberbullying should be a criminal offense. Cyberbullying is the act of bullying somebody in cyberspace [1], usually through text messaging or the internet. Bullying can be defined as the act of being cruel to others [2], and manifests itself in cyberspace in many ways [6]. It happens to people of all ages and races, and it's on the rise. More alarming is that kids are doing it more than adults, so when these kids grow up, unless something is done soon, we will probably see the prevalence of cyberbullying increasing. Almost half of all US kids have been bullied while online [3]. That's not something that is OK, for a number of reasons. First, it harms the victim. In my native New Zealand, three teenagers recently committed suicide due to text-message abuse. Aside from physical harms to the victim, there are social and emotional harms that must be considered. As with any bullying incident people still feel emotionally scarred for years to come [4], made far worse by the face that they often do not know for certain the people who cause the harm (43% of the time according to one Canadian study [3]). Often the bullying is one of the tools of choice for sexual predators too [5]. Second, it harms the person committing the cyber bullying. It gives them the idea that they can exploit people freely, as they got away with in a cyber setting. Unfortunately this is not the case, and soon they will find themselves in trouble with the law anyway. It is better to learn from a small crime than from a big one, because after committing a more minor offence such as harassment one does not feel as ""trapped"" within a life of crime. Third, it also has far-reaching effects on the victim's family, friends and community, as they feel vulnerable to the cyber threat and victimized along with the victim. My model to overcome this problem is simple. An immediate, outright, international ban on cyberbullying by means of a convention. This will tackle the main reasons why people cyberbully. When people know the consequences and learn to respect others, cyberbullying incidents go down [7]. While the problem might not be totally solvable, at least having the threat is bad enough. Having an international law is a significant threat, and it teaches the main body of cybercriminals - children - that what they are doing is not OK. What I don't mean to do is set up a false dichotomy. Any prevention would be desirable, it is only that an international ban would be the most desirable because it would tell adult cyberbullies that they cannot simply hire somebody in another country to do the dirty work for them. But what my opponent must rationalize, and what I believe he has failed to do, is why cyberbullying should not be banned, should not be an element of our social contract and therefore should be legitimized, despite the clear harms I have shown. My opponent told you three things. First he said that conviction would be difficult. Well, maybe. Let's look at another crime where you often don't know your attacker and is hard to prove intent beyond doubt, among other challenges - rape. In the USA, the rape conviction rate is only about 12% according to a 1990 study [9]. Does this mean we should decriminalize rape as a futile exercise? Of course not, that's just silly. And by the way, all of the points about the first amendment are lies. Freedom of speech is regularly curtailed if it is hate speech, and the best lawyers agree there is no constitutional right to cyberbully [8]. Second he said that it does not remedy the harm. Well, does it ever? If I murder somebody and get shipped off to jail for life, how does that make it any better for the family of the person I killed? The point is that when people do something wrong, society is obliged to impose some form of penalty upon them for the wrong they have done. I can demonstrate that taking one life is an equivalent harm to the loss of my own life (in jail). In the same way, the harm done by cyberbullying can be remedied. He said that education does remedy the wrong. So apparently if I murder somebody then the wrong will be remedied if somebody tells me ""don't do that again!"" No, it won't. The harm will be removed only when I have paid the price for my crime. The same is true for any crime, including cyberbullying. Third he said that the current laws are adequate. At this point he appears to be supporting the current laws of the USA, which ban cyberbullying [8]. Great, so therefore my opponent accepts that the ban on cyberbullying is a good thing and, as a general rule, we should ban cyberbullying. I am glad my opponent agrees! But none of that is what this debate is about. The two principles I said that I would bring to this debate are freedom from fear and innocence without guilty proof. A recent report showed that 5% of American kids are scared for their safety after cyberbullying [3]. Millions of kids are scared, in fear, because of cyberbullying. If 5% of American kids had become scared for their safety in the real world, they would have long past measures to counteract the problem. However, people think that if it happens in the virtual world it must be OK. It is not OK. Virtual gambling is as much a crime as real world gambling, so why can the same principle not be applied when people's whole mentalities are at stake? We pay our governments millions to protect us from external and internal threats to our safety - through the police and defense force - and here my opponent suggests we should ignore a significant segment of the population because the medium through which this fear is propagated is not on his select list. Second, cyberbullying makes it too easy to victimize people without guilty proof. I could post on my opponent's wall right now (""you're a _____!"") and he'd be instantly victimized. The trouble is, I don't have any positive proof of anything about my opponent. If we assume innocence without guilty proof, a good portion of the cyberbullying would not happen. Cyberbullying is wrong. I'm proud to oppose, and I'd be proud to have your vote to win this motion for the victims and all affected. I await my opponent's first crossfire anxiously.

80	Sdcc013e2-A6d175efe	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyberbullying should be a criminal offense.	"Thanks. I look forward to this round. PRO Round 1 Observation 1: I agree with my opponent's definitions for ""criminal offense"" and ""ought"". However, as his definition of cyberbullying narrows the topic down to children and students only, I will present a separate one to avoid any potential topicalities (cyberbullying and cyberharassment do occur among adults [a]). cyberbullying: the use of information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behaviour by an individual or group, that is intended to harm others [b]. Observation 2: This shall be a policy round, in that rather than only comparing facts or personal values, my opponent and I shall primarily be using good ol' argumentation to establish (or prevent the establishment of) a policy. My burden of proof is simply to demonstrate that the policy that I present holds more benefits to affected citizens than not having this policy. Observation 3: PLAN: In the state of Florida, any person convicted of cyberbullying shall be sentenced to a $1,000 fine, a year in prison for a misdemeanor, or both, as per court judge's discretion. This plan, having been established by the PRO, shall now replace the resolution as the topic being debated, as per Parli rules [j]. The plan has been set in the state of Florida due to the fact that penal codes cannot be established by the federal government for misdemeanors and because this, being my opponent's home state, helps keep the round on an even level. If my opponent feels that this plan sets the scope to be too narrow, he can present a topic-relevant counter-plan in the second part of this round. The numbers $1000 and 1 year come from the penalties in the state of California, where I reside [c]. Observation 4: Solvency, warranted by enthymemes. Claim: Cyberbullying is a widespread problem [e]. Claim: Criminalizing cyberbullying would help prevent this problem, because people are afraid of jail. Criminalizing means people caught cyberbullying go to jail. People don’t like jail, so they don’t cyberbully. Nobody likes the timeout corner. Warrant: Simple precedence shows that marijuana, which was quite popular in the 60s, has decreased in popularity ever since its illegalization [d]. It's a generally accepted fact that criminalization of an act helps prevent that act. Solve: Criminalizing helps solve the problem of cyberbullying. Observation 5: Advantages Advantage 1: Criminalizing cyberbullying prevents depression and suicides. Claim: Cyberbullying is a major cause of depression, and depression frequently can cause suicides. Also, depression can lead to students dropping out of school. Warrant: Cyberbullying is directly linked with an increased rate of depression, according to a study by the National Institutes of Health as reported by Reuters. In fact, cyberbullying is considered even more traumatizing to a victim than being physically beaten by the offender [f]. Warrant: Untreated depression is the #1 cause of suicide, reports Suicide.org [g]. Warrant: Feelings of depression contribute significantly to school dropout rates, according to studies by the University of Montreal [h]. Impact: Cyberbullying causes suicides. Sub-impact: In addition to the obvious problems this causes, suicides, in turn, have their negative effects on society, by causing family problems, more depression among friends and peers, etc. Impact: Cyberbullying causes people to drop out of school [h]. Cyberbullying causes depression, and depression causes people to drop out of school, ruining future job prospects. IMPACT: Since, as established in the solvency, criminalizing cyberbullying helps solve the problem, criminalizing cyberbullying would help prevent this depression, avoid these suicides and save lives. It would also prevent school dropouts, resulting in a smarter workforce tomorrow. Advantage 2: Criminalizing cyberbullying encourages positive social networking. Claim: Cyberbullying is scaring social networkers, or the people who visit social networking sites, away from social networking sites. Warrant: 40% of teens who use social networks report being cyberbullied, compared to 22% who are not on social networks, making it a common medium for cyber bullying [e]. Impact: Criminalizing cyberbullying will bring back networking visitors because they would be able to share and be social without the fear of being cyberbullied. This in turn, will deter the number of suicides caused by depression that is in turn caused by cyberbullying. IMPACT: Not only do networking users benefit, but social network sites would earn more money, thus injecting more money into the recession-plagued economy and generally having a positive impact on the markets. Advantage 3: Criminalizing cyberbullying creates an inflation of jobs. Claim: Criminalizing cyberbullying results in a number of people having to watch the Internet. Warrant: Of over 310 million are currently in the United States at the moment, nearly 28 million are jobless. [i] Impact: Because of the need for Internet security, networking industries will start hiring jobless people to watch for cyberbullies, causing an inflation in both jobs and revenue. This could potentially turn the economy around. Observation 6: Status Quo Currently, in the state of California, as in nearly all other states, cyberbullying is already a criminal offense. CA Penal Code 653.2 prohibits the use of electronic communications technology to cause any mental, emotional, or physical harm to another person [c]. The status quo is in place for a reason: these laws are necessary to protect the people. My opponent’s job is to now prove that a law criminalizing cyberbullying in Florida (currently FL education code says cyberbullying punishments are a school-district by school-district basis), and thus creating a $1,000 fine and a year of imprisonment, is not beneficial to the residents of Florida. I eagerly await his response. [a] http://www.personneltoday.com... [b] http://www.cyberbullying.org... [c] http://www.leginfo.ca.gov... [d] http://www.signonsandiego.com...

80	S50da0ef-A126de933	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Women should not be allowed to serve in Infantry	"I thank my opponent for his considered arguments, and I suppose I'll just jump right in. ""Women would have to register for selective service ( a.k.a. the Draft.)- Women would have to register for selective service if this act became enabled. How would be helping and or enforcing women""s rights? In fact I see the complete opposite here. Women""s rights would be destroyed, and not supported or enforced."" This makes little to no sense, especially as part of an argument concerning rights; the existence of a draft, that involuntarily forces individuals to serve in the armed forces, is a violation of rights in and of itself. Of course women being involuntarily conscripted into the military would be a violation of their rights; it is also a violation of the rights of men who are involuntarily conscripted. This has no impact on the 'validity' of men serving in combat positions, and it has no impact on the 'validity' of women serving in combat positions. It certainly has no bearing on whether or not they should serve in combat positions voluntarily. Which is the issue being debated, if I'm not mistaken; there is a reason volunteer-only militaries are invariably better than conscripted ones, and there is a reason a majority of first world countries no longer have a 'draft'. Involuntary military service has nothing to do with this issue. ""Combat is designed for men, not Women- Biologically speaking, Human anatomy shows that women tend to have a 20-25% lung capacity than men. In their review ""The Adaptations to Strength Training,"" Foland and Williams write that women typically have about 60 percent to 80 percent of the muscle mass of men. Women would have to carry 50-75 lbs of"" I believe your comment was cut off. Combat is 'designed' for combat; it is designed for people to kill one another, in order to gain or press some advantage on their opponent, in a military sense. No gender is necessarily 'required' for this. One is only required to be physically fit, healthy and reasonably above average in strength. Modern advances and practices continue to 'lower' this bar, though a rather high level of fitness will always be required. Combat, in itself, is not qualitatively 'different' to any other physically intensive activity. You do not need to be at the total, absolute peak of physical human ability to be considered for a place in a combat role; you need only be 'good enough'. That might sound a tad stupid, but there you have it. If every single potential infantryman had to be essentially a Dionysian demigod to be considered 'fit enough', we would have no infantry; it really is as simple as that. The minimum standards for joining combat positions are objectively quite high, but it is faulty to say that women are incapable of meeting those standards, and denying at least the opportunity to those who have clearly demonstrated that they are physically capable of such a position, purely on the grounds of their gender, is not 'good forward thinking', it's sexism. ""Combat is designed for men, not Women (Reason 2)- Katie Petronio is a graduate of Bowdoin College. She was the captain of the nationally ranked women""s hockey team during her college years; after them, she placed fourth in her class in Officer Candidates School. Think about this: When she entered the military, Petronio was ardently for women in combat She could bench almost 150 pounds (very impressive) She scored a 292 out of 300 on the Marine physical fitness test (truly a top-notch athlete) She was in the top 20% of performers in Basic Training We""re dealing here with a high-performer, an achiever, and a woman in peak shape. So what happened when she went to Afghanistan? Was she fine? Did she perform as well as she expected? Sadly, her body essentially buckled. She became a different person, physically. This is her quote from the injuries she suffered from training. As you can see, Katie Petronio is an outstanding Female soldier. She seems to rise above the others, Tier 1. However, Infantry training was just not right for her because she is a woman, and Combat is designed for men."" One woman, who by all accounts should have been able to endure the ardors of the job, was unable to. Therefore, her entire gender is also unable to, whether or not they meet the same standards and have the 'appearance' of being able to. Surely you can see how this is fallacious? This only qualifies the argument that women should be 'kept out' of combat positions inasmuch as they are not truly physically fit enough to be able to perform such a job. This is the same standard men are held to. It does not qualify a blanket ban on all women, because they are women, regardless of their individual fitness or qualification for such a position. As per the 'Pentagon 2016' statement you have shown, actual standards for joining in a combat role will not be lowered or changed to 'accommodate' women; if such standards are insufficient to ensure that all who pass them are actually fit enough for the job, they should be raised/reworked across the board, for both genders. Undoubtedly there will still be women who are capable of passing the increased standards and performing well in said position. 1) http://ethikapolitika.org... 2) http://www.livescience.com... 3) http://sistersinarms.ca... 4) http://chrishernandezauthor.com... 5) http://www.bloomberg.com..."

This debate will be focusing on schools. Over 3.2 million children are victims of bullying every year and 90 percent of 4th through 8th graders say they have been bullied. Over 56 percent of all students have seen clear instances of bullying and 10 percent of kids drop out of school to avoid bullies. This is an unacceptable trend to the reasoning of that someone's education should not be in jeopardy because of someone wants to feel empowered and that people who have valuable skills to offer to the world don't because bullies have destroyed their confidence. Suicide rates have skyrocketed among teens, with over 4,400 deaths a year. Over 7 percent of all high school students have tried to commit suicide. In short, bullying has harmful effects on everyone who is connected to both bullies and victims. my sources http://www.bullyingstatistics.org... http://www.dosomething.org...

80	S5be89fb-Aa506760e	1	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyberbullying that is held outside of school should be punished by the school.	"Justin W. Patchin states ""I have been using the internet since I was 4 years old. And I have had some experiences with ""cyber-bullying"", as it is now called. Funny, we used to call it ""people being idiots"". As most people who have been actually bullied in real life will tell you, cyberbullying is really stupid. ""Oh no. Some girl said to me in an email ""ur fat lulz"". I""m scarred for the rest of my life."" Nowhere NEAR as bad as getting hit, punched, abused, ect.""Norwegian psychologist Dan Olweus studied 450,000 American children between the ages of three to twelve to see if traditional bullying is still the most frequent kind of bullying. Of those in his sample, eighteen percent said they had been verbally bullied (the more traditional form) while about five percent had been cyberbullied. Among those doing the bullying, Ten percent said they did it verbally, while three percent said they did it the cyber-way. Bottom line? Olweus says the main problem is bullying in the traditional form, and that cyberbullying tends to be used as just one of many tactics. In addition, Olweus suggests we shouldn't spend too much time attacking the cyber-problem, when directing typical proactive measures to the general problem of bullying should suffice. In his research, Olweus says ""it turns out that cyberbullying, when studied in proper context, is a low-prevalence phenomenon, which has not increased over time and has not created many 'new' victims and bullies, that is, children and youth who are not also involved in some form of traditional bullying."" In short, cyberbullying doesn't prove to be a huge problem in schools, this issue should not be handled out of school. Handling cyberbullying outside of schools is like students not doing their homework resulting in suspension, or a child stealing money from their moms purse, resulting in suspension. Small problems that should not have anything to do with school lives should not be carried on into school discipline. In conclusion, cyberbullying could easily be stopped with the log out button or simply not being part of social media, and cyberbullying outside of school should not be punished by the school as it can easily be solved by the student and would be an invasion of privacy and often lead to legal issues when attempted to be punished by schools."

80	S9fe06406-A8ca2bbf8	0	0	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Adolescents ought to have the right to make autonomous medical choices	"Part One is the problem.A new face of childhood terror is sweeping across the metaphorical playground. Bullying has taken on an entirely new approach. No longer is the face of bullying a few thuggish kids on the playground demanding your lunch money, but a more insidious form of bullying from which there is no safe refuge, no escape from the torture. Webster[1]: Cyberbullying refers to bullying through ... technologies ... such as ... text messages, emails, phone calls, internet chat rooms, instant messaging – and ... social networking ... Cyberbullying is a fast growing trend that ... is more harmful than typical schoolyard bullying. Nearly all of us can be contacted 24/7 via the internet or our ... phones. Victims can be reached anytime and anyplace. For many children, home is no longer a refuge from the bullies. “Children can escape threats and abuse in the classroom, only to find text messages and emails from the same tormentors when they arrive home.” And, this is a problem that's impossible to escape from and impossible to find help for. Victims are afraid to ask for help from their parents or school officials because of the backlash or inability for school officials to help. Agatston et al.[2]:' Students indicated that the majority of the incidents occurred outside of the school day, with the exception of cyber bullying via text messaging. Students indicated that they were unlikely to report cyber bullying to the adults at school, as it ... occurs via ... phone use, and it is against the school policy to have ... phones on during school hours. ... Students also indicated that they did not think the adults at school could help them if they were experiencing cyber bullying. ... students also indicated that they were reluctant to report cyber bullying to parents because they feared the loss of online privileges Keith and Martin[3] furthers: Part of the problem in combating cyber-bullying ... is that parents and kids relate to technology very differently. ... adults approach computers as practical tools, while for kids the Internet is a lifeline to their peer group. ""Cyber-bullying is practically subterranean because it lives in the world of young people,"" ... Kids ... fear ... not only that the parents' response may make the bullying worse, but that the adults will take the technology away."" And, solving cyberbullying is difficult to do. Anonymity is the bully's primary and most effective weapon, from which there is no escape. Keith and Martin 2: It can be much more difficult to identify bullies in cyberspace. ... screen names ... hide a person’s true identity. It is easier to bully someone you don’t have to face. With no boundaries or tangible consequences, children are using technology to vent ... frustrations in ways that can become very destructive. ... home was a place where a kid could go to escape ... With advances in technology, home is no longer a haven. ... today’s bullies use technology to spread rumors and threats, making life miserable ... throughout the day and night. ... They cannot escape their bully because he can now follow them home. This is the new reality. Part Two is the Impacts:Cyberbullying is a serious mental health issue. It creates psychological problems and compounds already existing psychological issues. DeHue et al.[4]: ... being cyberbullied can ultimately result in serious physical, social, and psychological problems, such as serious depressive symptoms and stress. ... It has also been reported that youngsters with depressive symptoms experience more emotional stress as a consequence of being cyberbullied than do youngsters with less or no depressive symptoms. And, these psychological problems have multiple impacts on adolescents. Weisz et al.[5]: Depression in ... adolescents ... is a significant, persistent, and recurrent public health problem that undermines social and school functioning, generates severe family stress, and prompts significant use of mental health services ... Youth depression is also linked to increased risk of other psychiatric disorders ... as well as drug use and suicide ... which is the third most common cause of death among adolescents ... by the age of 18 years, some 20% of youths will have met criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder at least once ... Prospective longitudinal research has shown substantial continuity of youth depression into adulthood, with impaired functioning in work, social, and family life, and markedly elevated risk of adult suicide attempts and completed suicide ... And, in the status quo, adolescents aren't getting the help they need to recover. Day and Flynn[6]: The paucity of mental health services means that many children, adolescents, and their families do not receive the psycho-therapeutic treatment that they need. The consequences fo this may be mental illness in adulthood and genearational psychological disturbance and abuse. If ignored, these social and psychological problems do not simply go away. Indeed, they are likely to increase the demands on adult mental health services ... children who have symptoms of depression and anxiety are referred less frequently to mental health serviecs ... yet we know that children and adolescents with symptoms of depression are three times more likely to make a suicide attempt or be hospitalized ... Part Three is the Solvency:The plan text is this: The USFG will grant adolescents the medical autonomy to seek treatment for mental health issues without parental concent if necessary. Autonomy is the key to treatment. Without it, adolescents won't go get treatment. Driggs[7]: Confidentiality is also an issue in the treatment of mental health problems. Some states have recognized the fact that many minors might not seek help with problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and other psychiatric care if parental consent were required. These exceptions to the general rule are considered by some to be an outgrowth of the emergency treatment for minors and the states' role in the protection of minors ... studies indicate ... factors such as family stressors and parental psychopathology may play a part in the mental health care decision. These exceptions are nto absed on the level of maturity of the minor, but rather are based on on the issues of the possible transmission of venereal disease, in increase in teenage pregnancy, and confidentiality. And, treatment effectively solves the problem. Mallot and Beidel[8]: Most studies and meta-analyses examining treatment outcome reveal consistent support for exposure-based congnitive behavioral therapies (CBTs). In fact, the outcome data are so consistently positive that CBT is recognized as the treatment of choice for adolescents with anxiety disorders ... the core element of CBT are seen as equally applicable to separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, and GAD as these disorders share many features and appear to be distinct from other anxiety disorders.

80	S19d242fe-Aa7ef814b	1	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Should Cyber-bullying be a crime	Should cyper-bullying be a crime. Most people are stuck on this question and I am here to answer it. I think it should not be a crime because of many reasons. It is vital that you support my viewpoint. Cyber-bullying should not be a crime because it is the way a person takes in the bullying. If a person on Facebook calls you stupid, it is cyber-bullying but people won't take it in account. Many people have been cyber-bullied and most did not care or even fight back. Some extremely sensitive people do some crazy things like suicide and the rest of the world should pay for their mistakes. In my opinion I disbelieve that. And if they are sensitive, they should not be having any social networks if they know that they are sensitive. I think they should know that. Most cases of cyper-bullying has been revenge or that person did something or put themselves in the spot for that. A normal student does not get bullied.This is my argument of showing why cyber-bulling should not be a crime.	CON	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S9d79629d-A960984e7	2	0	How can we combat cyberbullying?	That we should ban anonymous online accounts	"I thank my opponent for brining up many valid points however I will begin now to bring you the clashes that have appeared in this debate. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO TACKLE CYBERBULLYING? The opposition has stated that ""By putting the power to halt the cyber bully's attacks in the victim's hands"" will halt cyber bullying. That is the status quo, however when i pressed my argument it has been greatly misinterpreted. Although now looking back upon my first argument ""Cyberbullying- the worst thing to happen to this generation"" was probably a massive overstatement but apparently from the comments i was saying is that we should lock up 8 year olds but that is not my case. I would like us to create a new deterrent that actually works. ""More than half of young people surveyed say that they never confide in their parents when cyber bullying happens to them."" That's a statistic from source (1) . Another statistic i found from source one was ""25 percent of teenagers report that they have experienced repeated bullying via their cell phone or on the internet."" Only 25% of teens report they have been cyber bullied however source one also says that 95% of teens have witnessed cyberbullying across various mediums. I guess what i'm trying to say is implementing this ban can and will act as a deterrent against cyberbullying. IS BEING ANONYMOUS BENEFICIAL? My opponent was strong in stating that anonymous sources will not exist however much of the time the person asks to be anonymous because the media all ready knows their identity, All i'm arguing for is the online anonymity to be banned, news sources do not have to quote the person they received the information from. It is up to the media to decide where they get it from. My opponent also said, ""No more can the whistle be blown when some one of power wields it to the disadvantage of many others."" however whistle blowers don't have a secret alibi. The two most well known whistle blowers are Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. Two people that I know, i've seen interviews with, i know where they are right now and i'm sure they know the whole world knows where they are. The main reason anyone will take you're whistle blowing seriously is the fact that they know you're identity. If you didn't come from inside the company and know their inner workings how can we not trust them however if they are an anonymous source we are less likely to believe them. I just wanted to point out the misleading statement made by my opponent. My view on anonymity being beneficial is that there is no point being anonymous if you have nothing to hide. In conclusion, I have showed you the reasoning behind the need for a deterrent against cyber bullying and i have explained the exploitation of anonymity by white collar criminals and finally i have shown you the two clashes each falling towards my favour. This is the last time I will write so I thank my opponent for accepting my challenge and I wish you luck for future debates. Source (1) http://nobullying.com..."

80	S469b1ab-A60fcba37	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Women in combat	"Once more, many thanks to all judges and others who read this debate as well as to my opponent for instigating it. I'm going to rebut my opponent's case, and then say a few words about my arguments in the earlier round as they apply to each argument that he made. But before I do that, I want to remark that while I take my opponent at his word that he does not believe himself to be a sexist, that the position he holds is unavoidably sexist because it discriminates on the basis of sex. I also want to outline the conditions for my winning this debate. If by the end of this debate you are persuaded that those women like Cadet Madeline Kenyon who can meet the existing standard for combat readiness should be allowed to serve in combat positions, then I am winning this debate. If, however, you are persuaded by my opponent that all women, without regard to their individual abilities and even if they are physically capable of meeting the physical demands of combat, should be discriminated against on the basis of their being female and excluded from combat positions, then you should vote for my opponent. My opponent's rebuttals fail for a number of reasons; most of them due to his fundamental misunderstanding of what women in combat roles means. I am not arguing, as he claims, that all women are physically capable of serving in combat roles. That would be absurd, because obviously not all women (nor all men) are physically capable of serving in combat. What I am arguing is that those women who are capable of meeting the standard for combat readiness should be allowed to serve in combat roles. This does not mean that standards for combat readiness (like the West Point obstacle course) should be lowered to accommodate for women, but rather that only those women who can demonstrate their physical aptitude should not be rendered ineligible on the basis that they are female -which is the status quo. So, when CON argues that some women are physically incapable of meeting the demands of combat, he's stating a fact but he's not advancing his argument because that point is neither in dispute nor does it advance his argument. It should be noted that not all women are going to be able to make the cut, and that's ok. What's not ok is excluding women who meet the standard from combat roles on the basis that they are female -but that's the case that my opponent has to argue in order to win this debate. CON's second effort to maintain institutional discrimination against women is equally unsuccessful. He claims that ""the military is not made to help genders be equal"" but rather ""is made to effectively protect and help a nation achieve its goals."" I agree, but I would add that the military is also not made to institutionally discriminate against half of its population. Moreover, if our nation's military's purpose is to achieve various military goals, then two implications follow: first, military positions should be filled on the basis of merit rather than who has a penis and who has a vagina, and second, the military should do all that it can to strengthen its strategic advantage. As I argued, citing Willian Denn above, having women in combat roles would strengthen the military. CON claims that he read Denn's article, and asserts that Denn had ""no research or data to support"" his claim -which is just false. Says Denn: ""Recent studies from Harvard Business School and MIT show that ""group intelligence"" of an organization rises when women are on teams. Women bring a unique level of ""social sensitivity,"" the ability to read the emotions of other people. On today""s complex battlefields, social sensitivity is a crucial skill for military professionals....Having women in our platoon would have dramatically increased our ability to elicit critical intelligence. This could mean the difference between a mission""s success or failure, with lives in the balance. Since 2011, U.S. Special Operations forces in Afghanistan have embedded all-female cultural support teams in their units. The program has been lauded by commanders for gaining access to the 50 percent of the Afghan population who have previously been inaccessible. Commanders are looking to deploy these teams to support operations in Africa. Army operations will probably require the same skill sets needed in Iraq and Afghanistan that women are adept at providing."" The studies Denn cites can be found here: http://hbr.org... CON attempts and fails to gain ground for his case by claiming that I've offered an insufficient number of examples to support the notion that women should not be excluded from combat roles on the basis of their being female because five examples are not enough ""to draw valid conclusions."" But, my opponent either misunderstands my burden or is out of touch with this debate. It is not my burden to prove that all women should be allowed to serve in combat. It is only my responsibility to show that those women who can meet the standard for combat readiness should not be excluded on the basis of their being female. I've given examples of women who meet the standard and are just as able as men to fight on the front lines, and there is literally no reason at all why they shouldn't be allowed to serve. They made the cut, and CON has yet to offer a good reason why they shouldn't be eligible. So, this debate is not about the average man or average woman. Those statistics have no bearing on the outcome of this debate, because we're not talking about average people. We're talking about soldiers, and whether those women who are physically able to serve in combat should be excluded on the basis of their being female. CON's argument about mixing genders is based on biased research from an organization whose purpose is to segregate school classrooms on the basis of gender. Schools are not battlefields, and school children are not soldiers. CON's argument is as tangential to this debate as it is insufficiently grounded. CON claims that because 1/10 women get pregnant while in the military, they should not be allowed to serve in combat roles. He also refers to menstruation. I would like to introduce my opponent to the concept of birth control, which prevents both of those things. (1) And even if a female soldier got pregnant while on duty, she could be removed from that capacity, then, and replaced with someone else. That's not a reason to keep women who are not pregnant out of combat. In sum, my opponent has failed to produce any reason at all why women who are physically able to serve in combat roles should be excluded on the basis of their being female. Therefore, I've won this debate. (1) http://www.webmd.com..."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S41078143-Adadcc969	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: cyberbullying should be a criminal offence	1. I concede that cyberbullying does harm the victim. However, how would criminalizing cyberbullying reduce the harm in any way? As I've stated, laws don't prevent cyberbullying at all. 2. You say that cyberbullying is a tool of choice for pedophiles. What do you mean by that? 3. You say getting away with cyberbullying gives people the idea that they can exploit people freely. That is no grounds for criminalizing something. Presently, bosses get away with verbally abusing their employees, politicians get away with being rude, and drivers get away with breaking all kinds of traffic rules. Getting away with those actions also gives people the idea that they can exploit people freely, don't you agree, but is it right to criminalize them? 4. It is better to learn from a small crime than a big crime, but would cyberbullying really be a small crime? The prosecution would try to prove that the cyberbully intentionally tried to get a victim to commit suicide. That is the equivalent of 1st degree murder. 5. You say that a victim's family, friends and community also feel unsafe when the victim is victimized. Really? I've never heard of a old-fashioned bully being a menace to anyone other than the victim. It's unreasonable that cyberbullying would be completely different from old-fashioned bullying. Where's your source for this? 6. You say that 'When people know the consequences and learn to respect others, cyberbullying incidents go down.' How would federal law be more effective than educational programs in teaching consequences and respect for others, I ask you? 7. How many teens are aware of laws that affect them? For example, no possession of child pornography? 8. For the purposes of this debate, cyberbullying will be restricted to incidents of teens hurting teens. Your 'international ban...would tell adult cyberbullies that they cannot simply hire somebody in another country' point is therefore void. (This is speech and debate's ruling) 9.

80	S455c4b70-Aaa2cafc9	1	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Social Media helps teenagers.	I'd like to open by looking at my opponents case sentence by sentence.I see it as a way to demoralize teenagers.This is true in some circumstances, but it's also true of everything. Everything can be used for good or bad. Both some of the greatest good and bad has been done in the name of religion. America is one of, if not the, best countries in the world. That doesn't mean it hasn't had its' fair share of terrible deeds and decisions. The fact of the matter is, however, that this is not the only or even primary use of social media.We should encourage them to have actual human contact. We can't do that if all we use are cell phones and computers.Texting and Social Media is human contact. We can talk to friends in other cities or even in our home town that we ordinarily wouldn't be able to communicate with. I have friends from parts of Europe and Asia that I can't see in person anymore. Social Media opens a huge door for being able to communicate with other humans in every kind of situation. We have never had a more social generation.Take for example. The average person has about 200 friends on facebook. (1) These are 200 people who are constantly updated on what you've been doing recently, and are just a click-of-a-button away from instant communication. I don't know about you, but if you take out social media, I only end up seeing a couple of those 200 people every day. Social gatherings and conversations have never been so close.Besides, it's easier to get away with bullying. Only 20 states have laws against cyberbullying.Cyberbullying never really made sense to me to be honest. The vast majority of individuals have no obligation, legally or otherwise, to be on social media. People are on social media because they want to be. If you're getting bullied online, you can just log off.I've heard it said before that people can spread rumors of individuals online, so logging off doesn't cut it. Well people can spread rumors in real life too. Social Media simply makes it more convenient.Children need to grow up. If one cannot handle being bullied, he should not be on social media, or even the internet for that matter, in the first place. We have limitless knowledge and information at the tip of our fingers, yet we'd rather spend more time complaining that some people are mean to us than use this ability the internet gives to us. I can't say anything to this kind of attitude but grow up or leave.1 in 5 cases of cyberbullying are reported. I've been one of the 4 who didn't report it.Could you please provide a citation for this? I understand how we know when cyberbullying is reported, but how do we know about the ones we don't know about?Also, assuming these numbers are in any way accurate, this 'cyberbullying' clearly wasn't too bad if 4/5 people didn't feel the need to seek help or complain about it. I understand people don't always verbalize everything they want, but this is no ones fault but their own, now isn't it?Teens post pictures of good scores on tests, or family trips when they put blood, sweat, and tears in to make it happen...This is a good thing. We should encourage people to appreciate their successes and opportunities. If someone has a good family, good for them. That's one more thing they have going for them! That's exciting. It makes people feel isolated if they have a dysfunctional family...Should we also hide the fact that people with good grades exist to protect the feelings of those with bad grades? Should we also hide the fact that rich people exist to protect the feelings of those from poor families? Should we also hide the fact that certain nations a better than others to protect the feelings of those from less fortunate countries? Of course not. This is reality. Just because someone doesn't have something, we shouldn't hide the people who do. I grew up in a dysfunctional family, but that didn't mean I got offended by people with good families. In reality I got excited for these people who were more fortunate than I. Everyone has their differences, and that's nothing to be afraid of.1 - http://bigthink.com...

80	Se6ca9ae6-A7c73ae10	2	2	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved:Should Cyber bullying be a criminal Offence? (Serious/Prepared Debaters Only Please)	"I accept this debate.Cyberbullying. We are all awere of it. But what exactly is cyberbullying and more importanlty, should it be considered a criminal offence. I presonaly negate the resolution, RESOLVED: Should Cyberbullying be a criminal offence.Contention 1: Most Cases of Cyberbullying are not to be considered criminal offences.Cyberbullying may be a problem. A problem we can all concede to. But, i say that in no way should a simple act of cyberbullying be considered a crime. The vast majority of cyberbullying incidents can and should be handled informally: with parents, schools, and others working together to address the problem before it rises to the level of a violation of criminal law(1). One should not take the problem too far, or else the lid could explode. For a criminal offence to occur there must be two main elements - the prohibited conduct and the mental element of a guilty mind or intention. Unless an offence falls into the unusual category of a strict liabilityoffence, the prosecution must, in order to prove that a person has committed an offence, show that both these elements were present(2). Thus, one can now begin to see that in order for Cyberbullying to be considered a crime, it would have to fall under the categories above. In many instances, the cases do NOT fall under the categories. If prosecutors can’t find anything to charge a particular cyberbully with, that bully has not committed a crime. If simply being a jerk was a criminal offense, we would need many more prisons than the hundreds we already have(6). There is no way one can say that Cyberbullying should be considered a crime. Furthermore, one can see that the penalty for a small infraction such as just taunting a person online is too severe. Contention 2: Cyberbullying is decresing, contrary to what one may beliveve.As a young adult living in todays society composed of computers and smart phones, i am very aware of the problems that such things pose. But, i am also aware that as one enters the stage of young adult, one tends to mature more. Cyberbullying is seen as a very immature and stupid act amongst my peers and myself. We MAY tend to judge people according to their clothes,race etc. but we never go beyond that. Now when I say ""WE"", I mean all of the 21st century teens around me. Moving on, a study published last month in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine found that the percentage of youth (of 12 to 17 years old) reporting physical bullying in the past year went down from 22 percent in 2003 to 15 percent in 2008(3). Furthermore, A national study commissioned by the Girl Scouts came to a similar conclusion. Young people are actually more responsible, more involved in their community, and more tolerant of diversity than they were 20 years ago. The survey found that 84 percent of youth said they wouldn't forward an embarrassing e-mail about someone else(4). One can now begin to see that cyberbullying is decreasing due to the fact that Many young people want no part of bullying and consider it reprehensible behavior(4). Thus, i belive that making Cyberbullying a crime would be a waste of time,due to the fact that Cyberbullying is decreasing.Contention 3: Making Cyberbullying a criminal offence would be loaded with trouble.Now, when I say TROUBLE, i mean legal problems. Implementing cyberbullying as a criminal offence would prove to be a disastrous event and a big waste of time. First of all, making cyberbullying a criminal offence would go directly against the First Amendment of the Constitution wich reads ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press""(5). A person has a right (given to him or her by the constitution) to post whatever he wishes to post online. If he or she wants to make a comment about a person, be it the president or his or her peer, they have a right to do it. The Constitution grants such a freedom, so why not exersice it? Furthermore, how can one prove that the cyberbullying is being aimed at a said victim because the said victim taunted the offender in the past? How can one prove that the said offender did not aim to harm the said victim and was only playing around with him or her? When people are punished, it should be for the harm that they intend to do. If a bully crosses the line between freedom of speech, and invasion of privacy, or harassment, those are the crimes he should be charged with, as is happening in the cases currently in the news(6). No person should be considered a criminal just because he exersised his freedom of speech. Plus, if it continualy nags at the victim, why does the vicim just walk away form the computer? There is absouloutley nothing stopping a said victim from walking to his parents and telling them what is occuring. In many cases, the victim of cyberbullying decides to take the verbal beating, as opposed to just simply SHUTTING THE COMPUTER SCREEN. One needs to take these things into consideration into hand before pointing the fingers. Cyberbullying may be a vast problem, but that does not mean that it should be made a criminal offence. When a person is being cyberbullied, he or she must deal with the problem as they seem fit. An offence , yes. A crime,no.Thus, i urge the voter to stand beside me in this resolution. Thank you for even taking the time to read my case. Have a great day.

80	S1ba6158f-A94ebe247	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Presidential Debate - Airmax1227 VS Larztheloser	"The president of DDO is much more than an administrative position. It also carries with it a lot of mandate to set the overall direction of the site. Airmax is a casual, infrequent debater, but a very frequent forum poster - he has posted around 250 times for each one debate he has completed. We both joined around the same time, and while I've been completing five and a half times as many debates as he has, Airmax has shown very little interest in debating at all. That's because he's not a debater. He's a mere politician.I don't blame Airmax one bit. Debates on this site aren't nearly as good as the forums on this site, as they have not been throughout the lifetime of his administration because Airmax hasn't fixed the problem. Still in this election campaign, Airmax is yet to give us one single reason to believe that debates on this site will improve if he is re-elected. I'm standing in this campaign because I'm dissatisfied with the status quo. Being very active around debating, I know what the turnover is like for debaters. It's getting worse.But I have more than a vision - I have a concrete plan to make it happen. There are four key ways in which airmax and I differ, aside from our overall vision for the site. DDO should be a debate site, and I'm a candidate who remembers that first and foremost.TournamentsIn the last election, this was Airmax's big policy. It won him my vote. Instead, while his leadership has given us tournaments, the people joining have almost universally been those who frequent the forums. Disagreements over resolutions and people dropping out as the tournaments have dragged on for months led to the tournaments failing, usually after only one or two rounds. Airmax's solution has been more tournaments, but it's clear that the tournaments themselves are flawed.RL debaters have been organising tournaments for hundreds of years. It's not that hard. One of the most important things is not to have too many tournaments. Right now this site has four tournaments running at the same time. Airmax has promised to start more every single month, for a total of at least around 50 tournaments a year, assuming, of course, that none are started independently. The harm is that you don't get quality tournaments, where beginners can learn from experts, where nobody joins a tournament only for it not to happen, or where they have to wait months. Each tournament should be worth winning. In RL, if you win a tournament, that means something to people. But when I say that I won Spinko's second ELO tournament (which I did), nobody cares. Why? Because it's just one of the hundreds of tournaments that happen on this site.The tournaments organised to date have proven a complete lack of understanding of the most basic principles of running a tournament. Debating tournaments in RL are usually run just like tournaments for chess, or tennis, but this site doesn't know about those. No brackets or power pairing, almost every tournament has been the same simple elimination, isolating beginners. No proper schedules. Almost all topics have been discussed between members via PM and agreed upon, wasting much time.I think it's telling that many of the best debaters on this site once enthusiastically signed up to tournaments, but are now very, very rarely seen anywhere near them. Airmax's tournaments have only reduced the quality on this site by distracting debaters. Tournaments can be saved, and I'm somebody who knows how to do that.VotingVoting on this site is a big issue. In the last election Airmax promised to increase their frequency. Right now the debates on the front page have an average of 1.5 votes. Four are completely unvoted. The number is artificially inflated by some very poor-quality debates that have an obvious winner, which generate a lot of non-helpful votes. It's clear that whatever Airmax has been doing (I actually have no clue), it's been a dismal failure.When my proposal of higher character limits on RFDs was actually implemented by Juggle, that made a huge difference to the quality of RFDs on the site. But the problem of voting is actually a wider cultural problem. Since I suggested it, the site user TUF did a ""voter of the week"" trial which spawned many votes and got a lot of interest. I want to make it a bit more official, advertise it a lot more, and refine the rules slightly to make it more interesting. I want to feature those users who give good votes.Quality matters too. I'm a candidate you can trust to push this since unlike Airmax, I don't just vote on forfeits. In fact, I tied first in that voter of the week competition.RL integrationMany debaters on here are also RL debaters, but this site does absolutely nothing to integrate with them. There were more topics on here about the Olympics than the World Interversity Championships, which Berlin went to all the trouble to film in part so people on sites like this could learn from and discuss them.I want to help and encourage site members to go to tournaments. I want to help them prepare by pushing video debates and discussing topics. I'd be in favor of shadow tournaments. I want RL events to be advertised on here. That creates buy-in and generates interest for RL debaters.BullyingIn his interview, Airmax stated he can't stop bullying before it happens. That's a lie and every bullying victim in the world knows it. Airmax has done nothing to reduce cyberbullying online.To combat bullying, you need to be proactive in preventing it, not reactive when it happens. Otherwise, it's going to happen. The principle is the same as on a schoolyard - if a teacher punishes kids only when they hit each other, then somebody's going to get hit, but if the teacher reminds students that bullying is not tolerated whenever things seem to be getting tense, that prevents a lot of the problem.Many of Airmax's decisions have been strongly questioned and only retrospectively explained. There have not exactly been many trials, but there have been many bannings. His own administration is secret, accountable only to him, and has never even attempted to provide any transparency. Airmax promised to give us weekly updates after I challenged him on this. Amazingly he has managed to break one of his campaign promises already, even before the vote, as this week this did not happen, nor the week before.ConclusionIt's time for DDO to return to being a site that debaters enjoy debating on. Only one candidate in this election campaign has the drive and vision to make that happen. I hope and trust that this is a vision you share.It's very important, for this reason, that readers of this debate vote come election time. Even if you've never been to the forums before, if you believe you can change this site, and improve it, then vote for the candidate who will make that happen."

80	Scee72b1d-A4ba3f04a	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"If you look at the scientific process many accepted theories are not 100% proven. Likewise the gene theory in regards to homosexual behaviors is not 100% proven but the evidence highly suggests it. It is safe to assume that the mostly likely answer is indeed the correct answer so long as you keep researching and do not attempt to block new information that could discredit the current stance. Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying

Bullying and opression should be used more interchangeably	"Saying bullied or oppressed isn't what is going to stop racists, Homophones, Or misogynists. I don't think generalizing one word will stop special treatment. I mean we aren't even addressing an instance where this was used to justify some sort of special action. I mean who is getting kicked out of school or facing a harassment charge because of bullying? How does the distinction between bullied and oppressed apply? Oppression isn't a synonym with ganging up. I mean we agreed on the definitions and being ganged up on isn't necessary for oppression. So I didn't think you were claiming that oppression was the new cyberbullying and I don't think using a word, Even if you use it wrong, Is limiting your freedom. What freedoms do you think are being limited by these words? I mean I can call a whataburger sign light red but that doesn't make it true. Orange is orange. Light red might be closer than say blue but it's still not quite the right word. So without a context of how this is actually affecting the punishment of bullies idk if the word is being weaponized or used poorly. Stop bullying. Gov uses 3 different demographics when talking about religious persecution because they have outward and visible signs of belief. The rest is generalized about origins. The site you quoted is actually very upfront about their lack of research. I'm not going to defend ""care based"" ethics. I think you're correct but I don't understand how you're using that logic to justify ""newspeak. "" I mean I have a comprehensive understanding of consequential and my own responses to it but I still don't understand the connection you're trying to make with that to essentially changing vocabulary. So we agree that both can harm a person. If you're arguing that in similar scenario's one is being treated better than the other then of course I don't condone one being called an oppressor and the other being called a bully. The proper way to combat inequalities in punishment isn't to combine terms but to emphasize terms. Especially when they are used wrong or are unnecessarily harsh.

Cyber bullying is a real issue going on in the world everyday and it's pushing more and more people on the edge of suicide and/or self harm. The victim can't just tell the bully, ""Hey you're hurting my feelings, please stop."" and expect the bully to just stop. The bully isn't going to just say ""Oh, okay I'm sorry if I upset you."" It doesn't work that way. There are more and more people opening their eyes everyday and questioning whether they're going to get cyber bullied today or why they even woke up that day.

Internet anonymity increases cyberbullying and trolling	Banning internet anonymity wouldn’t decrease cyberbullying and trolling Cyberbullying is bad, but internet anonymity isn’t the cause of rising suicides - cyberbullying is a circumstantial factor that triggers deeper, underlying problems in its victims.[1] Actually, banning internet anonymity can increase cyberbullying: when World of Warcraft announced their intentions to ban anonymity, female gamers voiced concerns of being forced to reveal their gender to other players, thus generating unwanted attention.[2] As to the problem of trolling causing discussions under newspaper-articles and forums to go ‘bad’: this isn’t necessarily the case. A mediating factor could be the exact system in place for placing comments: comment systems like Disqus allow people to comment anonymously but still be judged for the quality of their contribution to the discussion.[3] If organizations care about the quality of their online discussions, they will implement systems like this by themselves and wouldn’t need any government regulation.

Women in combat	"""all women, without regard to their individual abilities and even if they are physically capable of meeting the physical demands of combat, should be discriminated against on the basis of their being female and excluded from combat positions, then you should vote for my opponent."" This is an extremely biased statement. As mentioned in my previous argument, even the best women who were amazing in TRAINING were NOT able to handle real combat. In fact, through all the research that I've done on this topic, not a single woman who was in the military recommended it to other women or even continued to push this distorted ""equality"". All of them say that the battlefield is NOT a place for women. ""This does not mean that standards for combat readiness (like the West Point obstacle course) should be lowered to accommodate for women, but rather that only those women who can demonstrate their physical aptitude should not be rendered ineligible on the basis that they are female"" The fact of the matter is, that standards ARE already lower. This means that lower quality soldiers are allowed into the military, which makes the military less effective overall. http://www.thedailybeast.com... ""So, when CON argues that some women are physically incapable of meeting the demands of combat, he's stating a fact but he's not advancing his argument because that point is neither in dispute nor does it advance his argument."" It is in dispute since my opponent is arguing that women are physically capable. It is not ""some"" women, it is most women, as shown by the statistics. ""but I would add that the military is also not made to institutionally discriminate against half of its population."" This is an extreme exaggeration in the sense that most women don't even want to be in the military. Of the small population of women who DO want to be in the military, LESS THAN 8% said that they wanted to be in a combat position. So in reality, the military would only be barring a very tiny minority from what they want to do. http://dailycaller.com... ""women who meet the standard and are just as able as men to fight on the front lines, and there is literally no reason at all why they shouldn't be allowed to serve. They made the cut, and CON has yet to offer a good reason why they shouldn't be eligible."" As mentioned several times, even women who were exceptional at training could not handle combat as well as their fellow soldiers. The simple fact that estrogen levels plummet when the female body is exposed to such stress shows that women are not made for it. ""So, this debate is not about the average man or average woman. Those statistics have no bearing on the outcome of this debate, because we're not talking about average people."" Those statistics have a large bearing on this debate because it shows that the majority of women are physically incapable of serving in a combat position. Of the women that are capable to go through military training, very little want to actually go into combat. Why should the military change its ways (which are already effective) for a minuscule percentage of the population that wants to join? ""Schools are not battlefields, and school children are not soldiers. CON's argument is as tangential to this debate as it is insufficiently grounded."" School is not the military, but this study effectively shows the trend of how mixing the genders affects both, the males and females. They are distractions to each other. The military isn't all going out and fighting. Soldiers must train for long periods of time before they even step out on the battlefield, and being attracted to one of your fellow soldiers will greatly distract the individual from training. Think of the way men and women are when they are attracted to each other. They flirt, show off, and forget about the task at hand. There is NO place for this in the barracks, nor on the battlefield. ""And even if a female soldier got pregnant while on duty, she could be removed from that capacity, then, and replaced with someone else."" Let's imagine the following scenario. Men and women are both serving on a battleship. This provides close quarters and of course there are going to be cases of people having sex and getting pregnant. This ship now has to go off-course to drop off this pregnant woman to a location where she can safely have her child. This wasted time and energy that could have been effectively used to complete the battleship's mission. This kind of scenario not only jeopardizes the mission at hand, but also the health of the woman and child. The military should not have to waste its time and efforts taking care of women that got pregnant while serving. I'm not saying it's always the woman's fault, but it is still a situation that could easily be avoided. ""He also refers to menstruation. I would like to introduce my opponent to the concept of birth control, which prevents both of those things."" I read my opponent's source to support this claim and it said nothing of his claim that birth control prevents symptoms of menstruation. In fact, ""birth control pills have been shown to help PMS symptoms like breast tenderness, cramps, bloating and headache in many women. However, some women experience worse symptoms or develop new emotional symptoms while taking the pill. Because many women have reported improvement in PMS symptoms while taking birth control pills, you may want to talk to your doctor about trying them to see if they work for you. If they work, you can improve your overall quality of life. Just keep in mind that they don't work for everyone."" http://www.hellolife.net... This article says nothing about birth-control pills relieving mood-swings, depression or weakness. It is unnatural to skip periods and may result in health problems. http://www.owningpink.com... ""I've won this debate."" A pointless phrase. Saying it won't bring victory any closer. I would like to note that in reality, my opponent has very few arguments. Almost none. 1) Gender equality (which is negated by the fact that standards are lowered for women) 2) The opinion of William Denn (backed up by some vague research regarding ""social sensitivity"" and ""group intelligence"" which my opponent didn't manage to explain) Before we finish, I would like to sum up my arguments: 1) Military standards have been lowered for women, allowing for lower quality soldiers 2) Mixing the two genders will result in relationships and sex. Think about the fact that harassment of the women by the men is very likely. Also, in the case of capture, female prisoners will be treated worse by the enemy than the males (much more physical abuse and rape) 3) The cost vs. benefit will not make this process ""worth it"". The military would have to make adjustments to accommodate a very small, nearly negligible minority. Do not be offended by this statement, but if you do the math, you will realize that women that want to be in combat make up LESS THAN 1/1000 of a percent of the US population. http://www.army.mil... http://www.globalfirepower.com... http://dailycaller.com... 4) Symptoms of menstruation may pose a serious problem on the battlefield 5) Such extreme physical stress hurts women by dropping estrogen levels and does other kinds of bodily damage 6) Even in nature, it is the males that engage in combat This debate was not created to discriminate against anyone, but to honestly and rationally examine an issue of our age.

80	Scd58e68-Ab40d1b6b	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Whould women be allowed in combat type MOS's within the US Armed Forces	"Unfortunately, I realize that I mistakenly pressed the ""W"" as opposed to the ""S"" when I was posting this debate, so I do apologize. I agree, in today's progressive society, it is not a question of if we will ever allow females to operate in MOS's that have the capability and possibility of engaging the enemy in small arms fire, or hand to hand combat. No, the question we must ask ourselves as an elite military force in the world is ""Should we allow women to participate in combat?"" Now before I go any further let me make my topic clear. This is a debate about whether or not women should be given a rifle, and operate in the same manner as men do in today's modern age of combat. I am against this topic, and my opponent is for this topic. It is not reasonable to assume that the average women can operate at the same capacity, and perform the same tasks, as men when in a combat environment. My first point is that the average male is physically superior to the average female. There are certain things that females cannot be expected to do, due to limitations in strength. Although some females may be able to push through the pain of a ""furious, 20-kilometer, full-pack hike"", it is not a true testament to what it takes to get through combat. These courses that men go through, such as School of Infantry, are not ""proving grounds"" where the weak are weeded out, they are just another course, that teaches men how to operate in a combat environment. Although the PT is grueling, it is in no way a testament to ones ability to perform a combat role. Therefor, ones ability to pass this course is not a point that should be considered in allowing females to serve in combat. Let us also consider the simplicity that comes with having all male combat units. A platoon commander need not worry about separate sleeping arrangements, where each gender will use the head, where each gender will get dressed, whether or not the interactions between the two genders will result in sexual or even emotionally charged tension, but rather he can focus his attention on the mission at hand. Like it or not the number one priority in the armed forces is mission accomplishment, and after that comes troop welfare. Now this means that more often than not troop welfare will suffer in order for mission accomplishment. This means there are going to be times where one of them are just going to have to ""suck it up"" per se, because that specific unit neither has the time, nor the ability to offer such accommodations. You can imagine the chaos that can come out of these scenarios, everything from pregnancy while deployed, to emotional instability due to riffs in relationships, to the feeling of being treated unfairly, or being uncomfortable due to lack of privacy, these are all things that should not, but unfortunately would be, running through the minds of the troops, whose focus should be elsewhere. Now whether it is accepted by the masses or not, the boots on the ground today are still engaging in lethal hand to hand combat on a regular enough basis, that it is still in the curriculum of the schools we have previously mentioned. The guy who wins the struggle is going to be the one who is stronger. Now I am not claiming that this is WWII and the threat is around every corner, so we need to fix bayonets and eat our Wheaties every morning just in case. What I am saying is it still happens. And when it does happen it is not with a female, it is with a male opponent. I like my chances knowing that I have a stronger and faster individual watching my back. The simple fact is this. Combat is not a place for women. It is not about equality or human rights. It is about which candidate is better tasked for the job. And when the job is saving lives and taking lives that is a pretty important question to ask."	CON	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	Saeaae6a9-Ab7ef8006	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolve: Cyberbullying should be a criminal offense	First of all, I would like to thank my opponent for allowing me to participate in this debate. Now, while I do agree that the person being bullied is stupid because it's easy to just leave, I don't think that is an excuse to cyberbully someone. My opponent has provided no reasons why she thinks cyberbullying should not be a criminal offense other than stating that the person being bullied is stupid. This, however, is not a very good excuse to bully someone. I intend to show why cyberbullying SHOULD be a criminal offense. First some definitions. Bullying - to treat abusively to affect by means of force or coercion Coercing - to restrain or dominate by force Cyber - of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks Crime - an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law Offense - an infraction of law Felony - a grave crime formerly differing from a misdemeanor under English common law by involving forfeiture in addition to any other punishmentAll of these definitions can be found here: http://www.merriam-webster.com... The first reason that cyberbullying should be a criminal offense is as follows. Bullying is already an offense in 44 states (http://www.cyberbullying.us...), so why shouldn't cyberbullying be an offense. It's just as bad if not worse. Think about it, with regular bullying, the person being harassed has to see the person harassing them. They can give a description, and the perpetrator can be punished. A restraining order can also be filed. With cyberbullying, a person could be harassed from across the country. While it's possible to trace the messages back to their source, the perpetrator could be long gone, or they could have used a public computer. Also, there can't be a restraining order because the person can be well outside the limits of the order, and still harass someone. Next, harassment, a major part of bullying, is a crime. Therefore, bullying is a crime, and by default, cyberbullying should be a crime. Depending on the severity of harassment, it can be a gross misdemeanor, or even a felony. Now, a felony, by definition, is a grave crime. This is not good. That's why being a convicted felon can limit job opportunities, and in cases like sexual HARASSMENT, limit where you can live. Clearly, harassment is a huge crime, and because harassment is a part of bullying, I don't need specific sources to show that bullying is a crime. Since bullying is a crime, and cyberbullying is just bullying on the computer, cyberbullying should be a crime. Therefore, the act of cyberbullying should be a criminal offense. Finally, cyber bullying should be a criminal offense because it is inhumane. Everyone has heard of cases where people have killed themselves because they were being cyberbullied. This cannot go unpunished. The perpetrator has essentially murdered a person when this happens, and should be dealt with accordingly. There is no way to say that someone who engages in cyberbullying has good intentions. They want to make the person miserable, maybe not kill them, but make them miserable none the less. My opponent cannot possibly say that it is okay to drive someone to suicide, so how can they say that it is okay to cyberbully. I rest my case until I get a response. Once again, thank you tink1017 for allowing me to partake in this debate. Vote Pro to stop the abuse. Vote Con for death and despair.	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S41078143-A1adc2443	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: cyberbullying should be a criminal offence	First I will answer my opponent's questions. Then, I will go on to speech 2. 1. This harm must be remedied, but not by criminalizing it. 2. Yes, when we talk about criminal offences we are talking about people's futures. My opponent is proposing that we send cyberbullies to jail for hurtful speech that is commonplace in the workplace and at school. He is suggesting that dramatically increasing the difficulty of getting good jobs is just punishment for cyberbullies. 3. Did you read my quotes from speech 1. 45 states have had no results with anti-cyberbullying laws, but Long Island had great results with a few educational programs. 4. Difficulty of conviction makes it more likely that there would be no conviction. It makes no sense to waste the court's time with cases that are highly probable to have no conviction. 5. Yes, and because of this belief I seek the best solution to the cyberbullying issue, which is not, as my opponent believes, making cyberbullying a criminal offence. 6. 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions.' This is the case with the measure of criminalizing cyberbullying. The intentions may be good, but criminalization brings with it a host of problems. The risks outweigh the advantages. 7. 2 reasons: One, attacking cyberbullies have no face to face contact with their victims. They cannot perceive the harm that they cause to the victims. Two, some just take joy in making others suffer. You are not going to make this go away by criminalizing cyberbullying, nor will you prevent them from ruining lives. They will seek other routes to terrorize. To my opponent: I'm sorry that I didn't make clear in Round 1 that cyberbullying is to be defined as teens hurting teens, but that is speech and debate's definition, and I'm debating here to prepare for speech and debate. I will answer your current arguments, but I will ignore any more reference to adult cyberbullying. Speech 2: My opponent has stated that 5% of American children are scared after cyberbullying, but in the real world, at least 5% of American children are scared after bullying. Any fear online happens as a result of what happens in the real world. Therefore my opponent can post anything he wants on my wall and I would not care. I would want to see his evidence for his derogatory statements. I would taunt the fact that he cannot follow up on his threats. But if he went to my school, and had a reputation for mischief and a rash choler (bad temper), and happened to be my personal tormentor in school, I would have reason to fear for my safety should he threaten my life or my well-being. Cyberbullying is wrong, but the wrong in cyberbullying comes from bullying. Is the correct way of dealing with bullying criminalization? If not, what reason does my opponent use to justify criminalizing cyberbullying? My opponent has mislead you into thinking that cyberbullying is similar to rape and therefore should be criminalized. I ask you, how does cyberbullying share anything with rape? Is a rapist's intentions crystal clear? Would a rapist not know the harm that he causes? The answer to both these questions is yes, and that is why rape is illegal in this country. With cyberbullying, things are less clear. Most bullies mean to cause emotional pain, but not enough to motivate a victim to commit suicide. Most bullies don't know that they've caused more harm than appears on the surface, and that's why there have been school shootings and suicides. Criminalizing cyberbullying does not prevent these tragedies. I ask my opponent to define hate speech, since apparently he is willing to sacrifice his liberty to prevent it. Bosses verbally abuse employees every day. Does this count as hate speech? Apparently not, since there have been no law suits. What makes it ok for bosses to be mean, but illegal for kids to be mean? My opponent has a different interpretation of the phrase 'reduce harm'. I use this phrase to mean 'to prevent further harm', while my opponent takes the literal direction and uses it to say 'reduce the harm that the victim has suffered'. My opponent completely misunderstands me and rants for a half-paragraph that harm from actions cannot be undone. I agree, but the question is whether education can prevent further harm, not if it can resocialize criminals. He and I also have different interpretations of my 3rd contention. Current laws ban some aspects of cyberbullying, but not all. My opponent thinks that some is a synonym for all and uses the term cyberbullying, which is interpreted as all cyberbullying. The fact is that some aspects of verbal abuse need to be banned, but others are our liberties and should be defended. My opponent's international ban idea is not bad, but it fails to solve the problem (how many people actually hire foreign cronies?). 'For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, one strikes at the root.' In other words, for every thousand battling the effects of evil, one seeks to remedy the cause. We need to strike at the root, not pass new legislation to hack at the leaves. To strike at the root, we need social education. We need to teach people how to avoid being a target. We need to teach people what to do if they fear for their safety. We need to teach potential bullies that acts of unkindness are not tolerated.	CON	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S2db4e8f9-A38f576d1	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	"""The minimum legal drinking age should be age 25"""	"I'd like to thank CON for a great debate. O1) Paternalism Principle The government is more rational and better at making decisions than most people. Almost all lawmakers have a college degree. Congressmen have consultants to help them understand technical details. Lawmakers debate extensively using scientific research. Lawmakers have the time to analyze risk and reward. The average person does not. Therefore the paternalism principle has merits. We are not designed to ‘analyze risk over reward for every action'. Con has the BOP to show otherwise. Adults under 25 are especially bad at this task [1]. We are designed to survive in prehistoric times, not modern times with automobiles, weapons, and drugs. Con also uses a slippery slope fallacy to state that ‘why not the government regulate our every move?' It is better to learn from one's mistake as long as the mistakes will not cause serious permanent damage. Con's examples do not fit into this category. Consuming large amounts of alcohol does. If Con truly believes in the libertarian ethics, would he allow all drugs and banish the FDA? Should school not be compulsory? a) War on Drugs Drugs are still illegal in Portugal just decriminalized. Drug trafficking is still a criminal offense, and possession is still fined. [2] Con states ""16% have used cocaine."" The key word is ""used"" not ""active users"". If one takes that into account, the number is only 2%[3] This is a much smaller number than when cocaine was used widespread[4], demonstrating the success that the war on drugs has had. Con states that ""even if Pro can prove that paternalism worked, that doesn't justify the principle's use."" Pro has made a positive affirmation without backing up his claim. How is it unjustified? b) Seatbelts Seatbelt laws are effective. 80% of Americans using a seatbelt is a great number! People still commit murders even though it is illegal. That does not mean murder should be legal. c) Helmets Con's source proves nothing. The study didn't even apply to motorcyclist. Motorcyclists are required to wear helmets in laws in some states, not bicyclist. According to an article in the Journal of Medical Associations: ""Head injury death rates based on motorcycle registrations were also lowest in states with comprehensive helmet-use laws.""[5] O2) Brain development Unless Con can debunk the study I presented, it is a safer bet for the minimum drinking age to be 25, not 21. Your source says nothing about neurons not forming, just the distance between connections. It's a very hasty assumption to assume that means the brain does not mature. C1) Alcohol impedes brain development Often if people drink, they drink more than moderation. Both personal experience and evidence demonstrates this. Still, even moderate drinking causes brain shrinkage [6]. C2) Other harms Adolescents are still below the age of 25 so my sources still stand. C3) Alcohol harms others The source I cited states in its conclusion: ""Compared with a wide range of other programs and efforts to reduce drinking among teenagers, increasing the legal age for purchase and consumption of alcohol to 21 appears to have been the most successful effort to date""[7] The issue of drunk driving is associated with alcohol consumption, since one need to consume alcohol in order to drink and drive. This is the same logic of why enriched uranium and dangerous chemical possessions are regulated. Con states there is a difference since they can only be used for weapons. This statement is false. Enriched uranium can be used for energy. Perhaps a person could be a rare metal collector. Many dangerous chemicals are regulated even if they are not used for dangerous purposes. For example, special transportation needs to be considered for chemicals that are hazardous or explosive. The fact remains that drunk driving is a problem since one cannot voluntarily become sober. This is why it is treated differently from other issues as reading and driving, which is far less common. The best way to stop this would be to stop the drinking in the first place. It would be impractical to get rid of the car, since it is necessary for transportation. Drinking is unnecessary. C4) Alcohol related crimes 60% of all homicides are attributed to alcohol.[8] Imagine how many lives could be saved if the minimization law was 25. Even if this might ‘unfairly punish' some people, these people can wait until there 25 until they can drink. Many of our laws restrict certain age groups in participating in certain activities (ex: driving, voting, sex, etc.) based on statistics conducted on these age groups. Why should alcohol be any different? ==Rebuttal== R1) Con drops this case R2) Social lives There are alternative places for social gathering. Entertainment, mall, doing an activity (ex: golfing, paintballing, etc.), restaurants, etc. There are clubs that allow people under 21 to enter. I know from personal experience. With the demand to be social, businesses will create settings for social gatherings for people under 25. People rarely drink in moderation in social gatherings and I have shown above that drinking even in moderation is unhealthy. Con does not address that people under 21 also have social lives despite a minimization law already in place. R3) Career Opportunities I am correct that those of age 25 are unlikely to enter into a prestigious business deal. The average age of a CEO is 50[9]. Considering that it takes an average of 28 years to become a CEO, it seems very unlikely for someone with only a few years of professional experience will get involved in important business deals. Con states that business deals are domestic. Businesses are increasingly global [10] If the economic could progress during the times of prohibition, the positive effect on alcohol in business is minimal. This article shows how to build business relations. There is not one mention of alcohol [11]. R4) criminal justice or public health? I've shown ample evidence that making an act illegal is not only effective, but more effective then public health campaigns. R5) calling for help There are people who do not call for help. However, this number is still low. This point is moot unless Con proves that more lives are lost by people not calling for help than the amount of lives saved by the minimal drinking age law of 1984. I've shown, through plummeting drunk driving, minimum drinking age laws has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. R6) Risky behavior Binge drinking increases after the age of 21. My source states ""Rates of binge alcohol use in 2007 were 1.5 percent among 12 or 13 year olds, 7.8 percent among 14 or 15 year olds, 19.4 percent among 16 or 17 year olds, 35.7 percent among persons aged 18 to 20, and peaked among those aged 21 to 25 at 45.9 percent""[12] R7) No refute against claim that ""rights can bet taken away if pose threat to oneself and others"". Everyone is better off, and the resolution would result in diminished harm. Even if one disagrees with the parental principle, one at least agrees that the government has the right to protect others from harm, based on social contract theory. Conclusion: Almost all of my sources are peer reviewed journal that use the scientific methods as opposed to my opponent who uses mainly anecdotal and opinions. I have shown how the parental principle is effective in saving lives. Many people unnecessarily die at the hand of alcohol. This resolution could save many lives. Any benefit alcohol has is minimal compared to the unnecessary destruction it causes. http://tinyurl.com...[1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com...

Second you said in your rebuttal, "" I do know that mental disorders come from bullying, and that some may even develop from cyberbullying, BUT I have to argue that cyberbullying in general isn't a threat unless you let it be one."" but in your second round of rebuttals you stated, ""Next, anyone who develops a mental disorder over cyberbullying (depression,anxiety,suicidal thoughts, etc) clearly has other issues and CANNOT blame it all on the offender, because it takes more than a few words typed on a screen to bring a person to the state of wanting to KILL THEMSELVES."" I do believe you have just contradicted yourself and have flipped what you were trying to state. Yes it can be prevented by deleting the app or logging out, but if your boss had to contact you through that app and you had no other way of talking to them, deleting the app and making a new account would be useless as your boss would no longer have the account you're using. Yes I agree, "" because my happiness and mental stability is FAR more important than a silly app."" that was a very good point. You said, ""I simply cannot agree that something which can be stopped with the click of a button is an issue."" but not all cyber bullying can be stopped with the click of a button, nor will it ever stop. If you're getting harassed by people online and you delete the account and make a new one, there will still be people out there who will find your new account and keep harassing you. You of all people should know that cyber bullying is a real issue, if what you said about you ""having cyberbulling to the MAX,"" is true, and that it is an issue the world is facing and going through.

""Bullied victims are 7 to 9% more likely to consider suicide according to a study by Yale University. Studies in Britain have found half of the suicides among youth related to bullying.

80	S44dd2f7e-Ae21a8973	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Is cyberbullying really an issue	I want to start by thanking Con for instigating this thought-provoking debate. Since I am Pro, it will be my aim to show that Cyberbullying is indeed an issue. Definitions & ClarificationsCyberbullying: Bullying that takes place using electronic technology. Electronic technology includes devices and equipment such as cell phones, computers, and tablets as well as communication tools including social media sites, text messages, chat, and websites. [1]Issue: 1 - An important topic or problem for debate or discussion. [2] 2 - Problem or Difficulty. [2][1] http://www.stopbullying.gov...[2] http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...ArgumentsI. Bullying is unacceptable in our society.Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior and includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose. [3]The recipients of bullying often feel anxious, depressed, lonely, insecure, unable to focus or concentrate, afraid, or in the worst case, suicidal. The problem is that one party is responsible for forcibly impressing those feelings upon the other, or in some cases literally (physically) assaulting the victim. In America, we condone such actions in the form of having laws protecting individuals from such actions which even include prison time for the offender. With it now established that bullying is unacceptable, one needs only to extend bullying to cyberbullying which is nothing more than an extension of bullying itself as evidenced by the definition provided above. Thus, by extension, cyberbullying is also unacceptable in our society. When something which is a problem is deemed unacceptable, it then becomes an issue which I defined above as well. Due to the connection shown, I find no reason whatsoever to NOT consider cyberbullying an issue. It, quite literally, is. [3] http://www.stopbullying.gov...RebuttalsII. It is easily stoppable.My opponent makes this claim with the justification being that: No one is forcing you to be online. You can end it all with a simple click of a button.My opponent fails to realize that this is working under the false premise that the bully will simply go away if you are not online. What if the bully goes to your school? What if the bully had the means to hack your phone? What if the bully is still on the website when you go back in a few days?There are countless cases where the cyberbully has continued the abuse without the victim necessarily being online. If my opponent truly wishes to continue this line of argumentation I will gladly present multiple cases where this has occurred. In closing, I have shown that Cyberbullying is literally an issue, and have provided an additional rebuttal against the argument raised by my opponent negating his claim that cyberbullying can be stopped by the click of a button. I now return the floor to Con. Thank you.	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	Sf4d7ce3a-Afff68fbf	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Guns Are Needed To Defend Against Tyrannical Governments	"First I would like to summarize our discussion, mainly unaddressed arguments, for the sake of clarity and to facilitate my opponent's reply. New argument will be marked with (new) tag. Combating against popular tyrant: Both agreed that armed citizen is not a deterrent to a popular tyrant. Combating against internal tyrant: Contention no 1: US citizens, supported by defected military faction, may defeat the tyrannical force (Round 1) Rebuttal: In a direct confrontation, armed with strike capacity, both tactically and strategically, and with far superior logistic, a reasonably smart tyrannical government (RSTG) will quickly crush the rebel. (Round 1). Further, in all historical confrontations between US military and US rebels, the rebellions usually fallen apart rather quickly, in some cases without any actual combat, due to morale collapse. (Round 3). Sheer number does not means much if logistic can be strategically crippled by the RSTG - food, medicine and clothing supply will be restricted, arm and ammunition supply will be destroyed, HQ will be raided, external support will be blockaded... It would be only a matter of time before the rebellion collapse under its own weight, both in term of morale and material, at no significant cost to the RSTG (new). In fact, no direct confrontation is needed to combat the rebels: an efficient strategy the RSTG can adopt was outlined in my response in Round 1. Contention no 2: ""A citizen militia using guerilla tactics may be able to weaken the tyrannical regime"" Rebuttal: Guerrilla tactic, takes decades to be effective, and requires tremendous sacrifices - one that US partisans never faced. (Round 1) Drone forever changed the ability for one to wage a guerrilla war (Round 1). Further, the US government has decades of practice with counter-insurgency, both from the Vietnam War and the wars against terrorism, and can be argued to be the best in the world when it comes to combat insurgence, while most US citizens, military personnel included, have no experience on guerrilla tactics (new). Contention no 3: ""A citizen militia does not need to be able to match and defeat the tyrannical forces, all they need to do is make it too costly"" Rebuttal: The sole purpose of a tyrannical government is its existence - a RSTG will do everything it can to defend it (Round 3). The only alternative to crushing the rebellion is to surrender its authority, which all RSTG will never accept. The tyrant simply has no choice other than to confront the rebels and fight to the bitter end. This is fundamentally different with the Civil War - one side simply wished to be left alone, while the goal of a rebellion is to overthrow the tyrant (new). Thus no cost can be too costly - human or otherwise. Contention no 4: ""If the armed populace can cost the RSTG enough resources either economically or militarily, then there is a chance that it might fall apart itself from internal fighting"" Rebuttal: The first job of any tyrant - indeed the first sign of any reasonably smart tyrant, and how they likely came to power in the first place, is the complete and systematic elimination of other domestic factions and dissents by any means necessary, including political assassinations. Furthermore, combating external forces (the rebels) will actually reinforce the loyalty of the tyrant's deputies, similar to the way 9/11 unified the country (new). Only when the RSTG is actually losing ground and the threat of being overthrown is imminent, which is unlikely in the case of the US, then internal fighting may significantly impact a RSTG. Thus, historically, AFAIK, no RSTG has collapsed due to internal fighting while combating rebels. If my opponent can refer to one such example, it would be most welcomed. Combating against external tyrant: Contention no 5: ""a tryannical [sic] government would not become tyrannical because its citizens were armed"", thus a net positive effect. Rebuttal: Armed citizen during external invasion (and before the defeat of the defending army) may do more harm than good. Deeply unpopular measures such as high tax and draft law, which may be unpreventable, required and justified during conflicts, especially against an external invasion, may lead to riots, protests and even rebellion. A legit government's capability to wage war against external force will be crippled if citizen were armed during conflict, thus may resort to even more extreme and heavy handed solution, thus a net negative effect, and may do more harm than good (round 1). Contention no 6: Armed citizen is effective in combating invading army. Rebuttal: An organized militia - compulsory or voluntarily, with necessary chain of command, and provided with coordinated and efficient logistic, is far more capable at dealing with invading army than unorganized armed private citizens (Round 1). Thus given the choice, one should always goes for an organized militia instead of arming private citizens, unless as the last resort. Even in such case, arms is not the most in demand: ammunition and medicine usually face far more serious shortage. Invading army, unlike a RSTG, has no interest in keeping armed civilians, who would qualify for enemy combatant, alive, they can simply be bombed off the face of the earth similarly to the drone tactics of the US (new). And, finally, to address my opponent's new arguments: Contention no 7: Terrorist learned to use RPG without too much training (new) Rebuttal: Contrary to popular belief, militant Islamic in recent conflicts involving the US are quite well trained - most are veterans from the Afghan-Soviet conflict as insurgents, which were, ironically, trained by the CIA. https://en.wikipedia.org... The CIA training method proved to be an enduring success, and was used in the design of recent terrorist training camps, which ""usually takes the form of basic physical fitness training, progression to weapons training, training in armed assault techniques and bomb making"". https://www.mi5.gov.uk... On a lighter note, I would like to indulge the reader to a video of a Taliban who stepped on his own IED and detonate it. This prove that, handling IED is usually a dangerous business. http://www.youtube.com... Contention no 8: ""There is also the remote possibility that [...] an unorganized citizen militia may overthrow the invading army"" Rebuttal: If my opponent can lay out a plausible scenario or strategy that an unorganized citizen militia may overthrow an invading army that defeated the US military in the first place, I will *gladly* concede this point (new). Contention no 9: US government will turn into a tyrant when faced with external invasion Rebuttal: If the defender is winning, there is no reason for a government to turn into a tyrannical government while combating external force. One can easily see the reason why by reading job approval of FDR (~ 70-80%) and Truman (~87%) during and immediately after WW2, and that of Bush right after 9/11 (~ 90%). Due to the extreme patriotic nature of the US population, combating external invading forces is extremely popular in the US. When a government has an approval rating of ~80% with draft law in effect, marginal tax rate at ~90%, then there is no reason to turn into a tyrant - about everything the government do has broad and feverish support anyway. http://webapps.ropercenter.uconn.edu... http://webapps.ropercenter.uconn.edu... http://webapps.ropercenter.uconn.edu... If the defender is losing, then even turning into a tyrant will means a defeat anyway. And since a defeated government will no longer exist, the question is moot."

80	S37e9fe07-Aa8e11a88	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts.

You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S41078143-A9c6a94f3	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: cyberbullying should be a criminal offence	"First I will answer my opponent's questions. Then I will pose a few of my own. 1. How am I reducing harm to the victim For the victim, a harm is never directly reduced by imposing penalties. You can't undo damage done to somebody by harming somebody else. I have made it clear from the outset that my model does not give the victim rehabilitation or undoes the abuse. What it does do is give the victim justice. It gives the victim peace of mind that their attacker is unlikely to take the same action again. It restores their faith in the justice system. It protects them from future harm, as other would-be attackers know that this particular victim will tell the police. The benefits to the victim are indeed numerous. However, even these cannot be considered in isolation. They ignore the benefits to the other stakeholders as well ... the community and the attacker. These are equally numerous. My opponent also mentions his belief that these laws won't work. First, see my rape analogy that I deal with in question 9. Second, even if justice is not done for the victims, which I do not concede, then at least justice will be seen to be done. This is important because only then is the role of the state fulfilled. Third, most importantly, this argument is a subjective construction. The only objective argument my opponent has launched here is a reference to the first amendment, which I debunked in my speech. You can, in fact, prove mens rea (guilt of mind) beyond reasonable doubt using a text message. One would not accidentally text ""you are a loser"" to somebody without meaning to cause them pain. 2. How is cyberbullying used by pedophiles Cyberbullying is used by pedophiles, usually over the internet, to get young children to feel weak and control them. Not affecting this argument is your new rule that you will only debate this topic within the context of the teenage years, because first I made it before you unfairly shifted the context, and second because teenage pedophiles do in fact exist. Also see my rant under question 8. 3. Exploitation not grounds for criminalization Agreed. But that's not to say it's not a harm that can be remedied. By criminalizing something that does have such grounds, cyber-bullying, the harm is automatically corrected. It is, so to say, a positive externalize. 4. Cyberbullying not a small crime Usually it is. My opponent is right to point out that sometimes it is not, but as my opponent also points out, in these cases other laws deal with the situation adequately - for example, identity theft legislation. 5. Bullying only a harm to the victim First my opponent's example - schoolyard bullying - is silly. The internet is anonymous so bullies feel safer [1]. Often there is also less supervision and less ability for the victim to escape the bully [2]. Second, even schoolyard bullies can terrorize a family, who become concerned for a child's safety. They can in fact scare all who love and care for that child. Being a person who was often terrorized and hurt at school, by both other students and staff members, I know that my family suffered incredibly. My personal story might be a bit of an extreme example, but it underscores the point that bullies bully not just the victim alone. 6. Why is law more effective than education Because you cannot have education until you have the law. When I was at school, my teachers told me and my class all the time not to smoke cigarettes. That didn't stop about a quarter of my leaving year becoming smokers as soon as they left boarding school. Why? There was no law banning them. By way of contrast, we were also told not to take ecstasy. To the best of my knowledge (and because we were a very small school, my knowledge is pretty good), only one person from my form has ever even tried ecstasy, and none of them are regular ""users"". Why? Ecstasy is illegal. If you get busted you are screwed, figuratively speaking. Besides, it is not as though teenagers are unaware of the news and what goes on around them. Recently in New Zealand ""texting"" was banned in cars. Today, only about one or two fines are given for this a month, and even that rate is dropping (apparently)! Despite the fact, of course, that the biggest group of mobile-phone using drivers are teenagers. 7. Are teens aware of the fact they may not possess child porn? Yes. Yes they are. Ask them. If they are not, then it goes to show that your local education system fails. It's certainly on our curriculum. But without the law, you could never teach the kids these things, as I have stated. 8. We're not debating adults anymore First, you can't differentiate between adults and teens in a pure virtual world, so this ruling is itself of no practical significance and so totally void anyway. Second, substitute adults with kids and the argument is completely true even if it stood. Third this point is an implementational detail, and like I said, I do not want to have a false dichotomy between implementations. Fourth the ruling is officially challenged by my side of the house on the grounds that it is unfair to introduce a new element of context after context has been set and my arguments have been made. I expect a response from the chair justifying this ruling, otherwise we declare it moot. Until then, this point stands. 9. How is rape like cyberbullying? Like I said before, unknown attacker, hard to prove the intentions of both parties, and as you predicted would happen if cyberbullying was illegal, very low conviction rate. My questions: 1) How many more innocent children need to die before my opponent agrees this harm must be remedied? 2) Can my opponent show any significant costs that warrant cyberbullying's exclusion from the social contract? 3) On education, how and why will that be any more effective than the law? Don't you agree that it is your onus to prove this, not the other way around? 4) Why is difficulty of conviction a valid ground for not convicting? 5) Do you believe it is important for our kids to grow up in an environment free from fear? 6) Do you believe that any measure to counteract false victimization in our society is fundamentally good by virtue of this fact? 7) Why do you think that, despite large-scale internet anti-cyberbullying educational campaigns, cyberbullying still goes on?

80	S657f4fee-Ac969a002	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Story Challenge: Moat Maiden	As mentioned earlier, I planned three story challenges in a series set at a roughly medieval level of technology. In the first story we had to replace the bridge, building on the makeshift T-shaped combination of shovel and plank. In second story in this series, Cottage Cart, the hero crosses the moat and enters the cottage in which a maiden sits beside a stack of woven cloth. With all this cloth I've woven here, aid me to that castle. The king will surely pay us well, weaving is not facile. Yet all must come with us at once, leave none for fear of theft. Perhaps you need repair the cart, this is too much to heft. One cart wheel fell from its axle, its washer broke apart. Metal fatigue on rough terrain, makes jostling an art. The cottage contains: • a fireplace – unlit, but prepared with logs stacked on kindling • a loom – mostly wood, but powered by a steel foot pedal • a handcart – which seems to be missing a wheel Behind the loom rests a tool chest. The tool chest contains: • a new washer – a disc with a hole in the middle, like a flat donut • a pair of tongs – iron and look like pliers with long handles • a glove – thick leather with a long sleeve By the fireplace is a chunk of flint. Closer inspection of reveals that: • the flint is an egg-size sedimentary rock • the glove is like the kind used by a blacksmith • the new washer is like the axle washers, but slightly too small for the axle In Round 4 I will introduce the third story in this series.

80	S83215899-Ac96433c3	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyberbullying Is Not Real	"Hello! Today I will be debating why cyberbullying exists. I am not saying that it""s a big issue, I""m just debating that it exists. When we define bullying, younger and older people typically have different definitions on what cyberbullying is due to the expectation that bullies are rare. At my school, there are a lot of people who I would define as idiots. I wouldn""t typically define them as bullies because they""re common. But in an adult setting if you see someone like a jerk at my school, you think that they""re a bully because they are uncommon. This idea needs to stop. We need to have the idea the bullies are common in schools so that we have a better chance to stop harassment. Cyberbullying is a more common form of bullying where someone bullies another online. A common example of this is sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is an uncommon form of bullying online and in real life, but unlike traditional forms of bullying is dealt with in a similar manner regardless of where it takes place. We take a look at the 4000 people every year who commit suicide because of cyberbullying ands realize that this is an ongoing issue (still overinflated in my opinion, but a notable issue). Cyberbullying can cause a wide range of negative effects such as depression, anxiety, fear, low self esteem, and academic struggles. This is why I believe that cyberbullying exists. Thank you!

"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying

80	Se6ca9ae6-A3c1c6476	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved:Should Cyber bullying be a criminal Offence? (Serious/Prepared Debaters Only Please)	"I shall begin by attacking my opponents case, then i shall go on to defend my case. Opponent point 1: To start, i would like to point out that my opponent is acctualy GOING AGAINST HIMSELF in saying that Cyberbullying has been decreasing. If Cyberbullying is decreasing, there is no need to acctualy make it a criminal offence. In just a few words, i have voided my opponents first point. Another question, what law is my opponent refering too in his first point? There are various laws, but wich one is he speaking about? Furthermore, my opponent continues on to say that ""Cyber bullying has decreased more in one year than it has in the last 10 years"" and he claims that the said law was the one that helped do that. But i say that because that law is already in place, there is no need to intrude upon the effects of the said law by making cyberbullying a crime. If the law is SO helpful, why not let IT deal with Cyberbullying?Opponent point 2: I shall begin by pointing out that my opponet actualy CONTRADICTS his first point, therfore making both points invalid. I shall continue nontheless. I would like my opponent to cite the source of the website or study where he stated that ""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noticed a rise in cyber bullying""( if possible please). "" According to BBC news, Childlike staff in Nottingham said new technology had dramatically increased their workload. The charity receives about 4,500 calls a day nationally and about a quarter of these come from victims of bullying."" These two sentences make almost no sense to me. First, my opponent is talking about Childlike staff. What is Childlike staff? Is that like child labor? Then he says something about Nottingham. Even later, he goes on to talk about a charity. What charity? I do hope that my opponent knows that he did not name the said charity. In the last sentence, he also talks about 4,500 calls concerning bullying. First of all, where are these calls heading too? Second of all, my opponent made a grave mistake in saying ""Bullying"" instead of Cyberbullying. For all we know, those 4,500 calls could have been about bullying at school, not Cyberbullying. Thus, this argument is invalid due to the fact that it has nothing to do with Cyberbullying. Not only that, but my opponent provides no source. Opponent Contention 3: My opponent revolves this contention around the fact that cyberbullying is negative.""Most victims suffer shame, embarrassment, anger, depression and withdrawal."" I belive that the victims that my opponent is speaking about, chose to suffer from all these things. As stated in my 3rd contention, it is very simple to just close the computer and walk away. Those that stay behind the computer screen chose to do so. No one is stoping them from getting help. ""Is this something that deserves to be bypassed?""I belive that my opponent strongly goes against himself by saying this. According to him, there are laws that do not allow these things to happen. Because something is not called a crime, it does not mean it will be bypassed. So if my opponent agrees that there are laws in place that help stop Cyberbullying, then it is in fact not being bypassed. Furthermore, my opponent gives a very vauge peice of evidence. There is no website called Cyberbullying.com. If the voter does not belive me, all he or she simply has to do is type in ""cyberbullying.com"". No website under that specific name appears. Cyberbullying.org does appear, but my opponent clrearly stated cyberbullying.com as his source. Thus, his whole argument has just been proven void. Whats more, my opponent yet again gives a very vauge source in his second to last sentence. Where exactly did this Turku University study come from? My opponent gives no source for the said study, therfore one can belive that the study is fake.Now, I shall continue by defening my case. My opponent yet again brings in the arugent about the fact that cyberbullying is decreasing. I belive we have established that. What's more, he gives yet ANOTHER vauge peice of evidence. Where exactly did he get his reaserch from the Nation Crime Prevention Council? Only he knows. He then continues on to attack me for reasons not icluded in my first conteniton. The deacresment of cyberbullying is strictly tied to my SECOND contention and not my FIRST contention, therfore, one can agree that my opponent has attaked the wrong contention. My opponent YET AGAIN contraditcts himself by saying that Cyberbullying has NOT decreased, contrary to what he would have us belive in his first contention. Furthermore,he says that ""Methods such as counseling, teaching, and prevention programs have FAILED to work and decrease Cyber Bullying."" There is no way my opponent has proved what he said in the last sentence. He is not using solid evidence to back that arument up. ""Using Girl Scouts is not a reliable comparison as you are using children of too young of an age; we must include the rest of the teenage population of America or else the comparison will become invalid.""To counter what my opponent has stated, i say that he should realize that girl scouts range from ages of 5 years of age, to 18 years of age . Therfore, if a teen is considered anyone after 13, then it is safe to say that the girl scout study i provided is in fact very reliable.""Also, my opponent uses a source Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine stating that PHYSICAL BULLYING (Note: PHYSICAL) has decreases"" Take in consideration, my friends, that somtimes Cyberbullying may lead to phisical abuse. If a bully says on the web "" i am going to beat you up because your ugly"" to a victim, one can see that the cyberbullying and bullying have a correlation. The next day, the victim could be cornered by the bully and beaten."" CyberBullying is NOT defended by the first amendment.""And why is it not? A person has a freedom of press as well, and putting something on the internet about someone or a group of people is basicly tied to the press, because they are reporting facts about that said someone. Therfoere, if cyberbullying were to be made a criminal offence, ones freedom of speech and of the press would be striped.I am running out of characters so i shall close. In summation, my opponetns case seems very vauge due to the lack of tangible evidence. Thank you for reading my rebuttal."	CON	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S469b1ab-A38fadf65	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Women in combat	"Thank you for accepting the challenge. Before I begin, I would like to say that I am not sexist and in no way would like to offend women. First, my opponent addresses physical readiness and argues that women physically capable of serving in combat positions. To support, this he brings up examples of 5 women who were able to achieve great physical feats. I find this almost silly. You cannot base an entire gender off of 5 women who are exceptions. That's like saying that since there are women who do heavy lifting and can lift more weight than most men, then women are stronger than men. In fact, physical standards have been lowered in order to help women get into the Marines because over half of them failed the original test. http://www.thedailybeast.com... ""including women in combat roles would not only serve to advance gender equality by removing institutionally discriminatory practices, but doing so would also be 'a valuable enhancement of military effectiveness and national security.'"" The military is not made to help genders be equal. The military is made to effectively protect and help a nation achieve its goals. I read the article my opponent provided to support this claim and it is very vague and opinionated. It has no research or data to support the claim that women ""enhance military effectiveness"" and uses 5 women as examples that women can be on par with military standards. If this was thousands of women, then that would be valid data, but 5 is far too little to draw valid conclusions. Here is a video in which a female marine describes her experiences. She says that even though she performed only a portion of what her male comrades were doing, she still faced serious physical stress. This stress caused her estrogen levels to plummet, which led to her infertility. After her deployment, not only did she stop producing estrogen, but she also lost 17 lbs and had muscle atrophy. Don't forget that this woman was amazing in training (just like the women my opponent spoke of), but her body could not handle real combat. https://www.mca-marines.org... http://www.patheos.com... Here is another female ex-veteran who explains that the battlefield isn't a place for women to be. ""The best woman is still no match for the best man, and most of the men she""d be fireman-carrying off the battlefield will be at least 100 lbs heavier than her with their gear on."" Even with having to carry 100 lbs less than the men, the women still had a lot of trouble. http://www.westernjournalism.com... On the subject of physical strength, it is also proven that the average woman has 60% of the physical strength of the average man. http://www.bible-researcher.com... Even on a biological level, men are better prepared for combat. Men have thicker skin and grow muscle much faster than women. You can even take a look at nature, it's the males that always fight. Whether it's for territory, or for mates, the males are always the ones engaging in combat. (Except for rare exceptions that I may not be aware of). http://www.menscience.com... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... There is also a problem with mixing genders. It is inevitable that having both genders in such close quarters would cause problems. The battlefield is not a place for relationships and sex, but it will happen no matter how much we try to avoid it. It is a problem that the military does not have to take upon itself if it refuses women access to the battlefield. It sounds harsh, but let's compare this to uni-sex vs. mixed schools. Uni-sex schools perform significantly higher on standard exams since they do not have the distraction from the opposite gender. http://www.singlesexschools.org... Think about the fact that 1 in 10 women get pregnant while in the military. That is very high and sex should be the last thing on a soldier's mind. I'm not saying its always the woman's fault, I'm just saying that mixing the sexes has an obvious negative effect. http://articles.chicagotribune.com... Menstruation must also be considered. This is a process that causes women to lose half of their physical strength and also results in erratic changes in mood/emotional state. This could amount to an absolute breakdown during combat which could not only contribute to the harm/death of the individual, but could also undermine fellow soldiers who were depending on the individual. http://www.everydayhealth.com... http://www.westernjournalism.com...

80	S469b1ab-A7c3aecc3	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Women in combat	"Many thanks to CON for initiating this debate, and to all judges who will read it. Before I begin, some preliminary matters must be addressed. The reason these must be addressed now is because CON and I did not work out the details of this debate beforehand. Nevertheless, I look forward to an interesting and thought provoking discussion. This debate is about whether women should be allowed to serve in combat roles, not whether all women should be compelled to serve in combat capacity. The latter is an absurd interpretation of the resolution, and would be an absurd topic to debate. As such, it is the former that merits our attention. As PRO, it is my responsibility to argue that women should be allowed to serve in combat roles. CON must argue that women should not be allowed to serve in combat roles. I'm going to talk about some background information, and then begin my case -as stipulated by CON in his first posting in this debate. Background: Throughout the history of war, only men have conventionally served in a combat capacity. It goes without saying that many people are uncomfortable with the idea of women serving in combat roles, perhaps in large part due to the social stigmas associated both with the idea of women serving as infantry soldiers and women being killed on the battlefield. In today's debate, I posit that neither are sufficient reasons to justify women's exclusion from combat roles. Even though the Department of Defense in the United States removed its historical prohibition which precluded women's serving in combat roles last April, some military jobs are still only open to men such as Special Operations Forces, Ranger School, and the Marine Infantry. (1) My Case: (1) Women are physically able to serve in combat positions. Many of the historical objections to women serving in infantry/combat roles stem from the misguided belief that women are somehow physically unable to meet the physical demands of warfare. Freshman Cadet Madaline Kenyon completed the course in 2R01;minutes 26 seconds, which set a new record for women and amounts to an A+ rating on the men's scale. If passing West Point's obstacle course in record time is any indication of physical ability, then women are just as able as men are to respond to the physical demands of combat. (2) Additionally, four female marines enrolled in the Marine Corps"" enlisted infantry training course ""passed what is considered the most strenuous aspect of the Marines"" infantry training: a 12-mile march carrying 80 pounds of gear."" (2) Women who are just as able as men to serve in combat roles, then, ought to be able to serve. This in no way implies that the standard for combat readiness will or should be lowered in any way. It only means that all those who are able to meet it, as Cadet Kenyon was, will not be be subject to institutional discrimination on the basis of their gender. (2) ""Women in combat roles would strengthen the military."" -William Denn, April 3 2014. Washington Post. William Denn, whose credentials are listed in the footnote below, argues that because group intelligence rises when women are present in organizations, women's presence in combat units presents a unique strategic advantage to today's military. Citing evidence from the Harvard Business School and MIT research, Denn contends: ""Women bring a unique level of ""social sensitivity,"" the ability to read the emotions of other people. On today""s complex battlefields, social sensitivity is a crucial skill for military professionals. During my patrols in Iraq from 2007 to 2009, I came to appreciate how much women could have contributed to my mission. Most Iraqi men were reticent to speak with us for fear of retribution from al-Qaeda. Iraqi women, often fed up with the violence in their neighborhoods, could be persuaded to provide information, but first we had to bridge the gender gap, build rapport and earn their trust, all of which took valuable time. Having women in our platoon would have dramatically increased our ability to elicit critical intelligence. This could mean the difference between a mission""s success or failure, with lives in the balance."" Indeed, Denn concludes that the military's including women in combat roles would not only serve to advance gender equality by removing institutionally discriminatory practices, but doing so would also be ""a valuable enhancement of military effectiveness and national security."" I will await my opponent's case and rebuttal in the following round. Sources: 1. http://www.truth-out.org... 2.

80	Sb090bcf2-A4c4bc696	2	2	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: Cyber bullying should be a criminal offense.	"No problem! I'm in school too, I completely understand. But yes, on to the debate! 1) My opponent says that you can choose to ignore the person online, however, what about sites such as Formspring? You cannot block a person on Formspring, and it should not be the victims problem to have to delete their account online: we should be punishing the bully. Also, by not creating a law against cyberbullying, we are essentially saying that cyberbullying is okay. We are not promoting it exactly, however we are complying with it, because we see that it is a problem, but we choose to ignore it. And yes, by creating a law against cyberbullying, less people would do it. 23% of people said that they would be less likely to cyberbully if it was made illegal. 2) I agree: it is a cop out method. Just because something is hard, doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do. Cyberbullying is a huge problem in our nation today, and we need to create a law that says that it is not okay to cyberbully people. We will not be infringing on a person's rights, because laws are there to eliminate the gray area; we will be saying: this is what is okay to say, and this is what is not. No one will be wondering ""if I say this, will I be in trouble?"" because the law will define what is okay to say and what is not. 3) Education is a great option, and we can have legislation and education, however cyberbullying should be a criminal offence for the reasons I have already stated: it is a widespread problem, it is invasive of privacy, we would be saving lives, and we would be giving victims a method to stop the bullying. Education can only prevent people from cyberbullying another person, education can't actually stop someone from cyberbullying another. 4) Like I stated in my previous point, we could have both education and legislation. However, education will only go so far. Education can't stop someone from cyberbullying another, but having a law can. Education is a great option, however we are debating whether or not cyberbullying should be a criminal offence. I believe that cyberbullying should be a criminal offence, and I believe that you must vote Affirmative because education can only go so far. Once someone does cyberbully another person, what use will education be? Absolutely none. This is why I believe you must vote Affirmative on this resolution. I thank my opponent for debating me on this topic, it was a great debate! Good job, and good luck in your final speech. I would ask, for reasons of fairness, that my opponent doesn't bring up any new arguments in their last speech because I can't respond after this. Vote Affirmative, and help crack down on this serious problem in our nation today. Thank you."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying

80	S41078143-Acbf676d2	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: cyberbullying should be a criminal offence	"I'm sorry to my opponent, sadly I am busy all weekend and cannot post my argument then. I hope that this isn't too much of a problem, and I'm really sorry. First my answers to my opponent's questions: 1) Who actually listens to preachers these days? Several people. However, in just the same way, I could say ""how many of us actually get cyberbullying education these days?"" The present scale does not void the argument. However, I further contend that the present scale wasn't the argument. If my opponent insists people do what they learn without legal threat, he must agree all Christians are following the golden rule. This is regardless of how many Christians there are. In the same way, my opponent claims all who receive cyberbullying education do not cyberbully, even when they have no reason not to cyberbully other than a teacher telling them not to, and perhaps many reasons to cyberbully, such as a provocation. I doubt that logic. 2) Why are there still teenage smokers? There is no legal threat against smoking. Sure, there is an age restriction, but teens have never cared for age restrictions. They have, however, cared for the law. This is why anti-Marijuana education is working much better than anti-Tobacco education, as evidenced by the smoker rates. That is why blanket legislation for everybody will solve the problem for teens, or at least make it smaller so that it is manageable for counselors to deal with. 3) This was really a lot of questions under one heading... a) How does having a hard time finding a job repay a minor crime? Theft is also usually a minor crime, but it gives people a hard time finding a job. I think present theft legislation works well. b) How many good people would be rejected by firms because of bureaucracy? Hopefully, none. It should be up to the firms to decide whether they want to hire a known cyberbully or not. All this has nothing to do with bureaucracy. c) Wouldn't the cyberbully seek revenge, causing the victim to be in more fear? If that is what the victim thinks, then counseling can help! The cyberbully would clearly not seek revenge as they have learnt their lesson the hard way. Repeat offending for cyberbullying is already very low at present. d) Have you ever been unemployed and starving in the streets? Besides the point. Cyberbullies would benefit as they learn a lesson. I think you'll find most ex-criminals are in fact in employment, especially ex-criminals who have only committed a single, small crime with no prison term attached. e) How would criminalizing cyberbullying benefit society? As I said in round one, anything that helps the victim inherently helps society. 4) When did the chair say not to reference adults? A consequence of the chair's decision to uphold the ruling without any regard for my arguments against is exactly this, for if we cannot speak of adult cyberbullying, we cannot speak of the criminalization of adults. My model is still criminalizing it for everyone (pre-teens, teens and adults), but in this debate my arguments can only pertain specifically to teens, because otherwise I'd be suggesting positive benefits to adults. In the context of the argument I was making, I still maintain the blanket criminalization is optimal, and criminalization for only teens (like my opponent suggested, but which isn't my model) is better than not criminalizing. 5) What about an effort that does not reduce the old problem, but creates new ones? My opponent has failed to show his supposed new problems. I have clearly shown the mechanism by which legal threats can solve old problems, and why they will in this scenario. Therefore I do not agree that criminalization is such an effort. 6) Agreed with your principles? When? When you answered my last set of questions, numbers 5 and 6. 7) Now that you ask, I'd like you to read a statute, case, or declaration that proclaims the illegality of cyberbullying and is in force today. Funny that you couldn't give me yours. This totally destroys your point that freedom to cyberbully is in the law, or that cyberbullying is freedom of speech. By way of contrast, I gave you no points that have anything to do with the legality of cyberbullying except as rebuttal to your points. As to what I'd refer you to, what was that legislation you pointed to in round one again? Anti-cyberbullying legislation, was it not? Now my questions: 1) I have offered the model of criminalization. You've agreed with my problem but doubted my method. Please tell me why: a) It is wrong for cyberbullies to be punished for cyberbullying. b) It is wrong for victims to be given the strongest and best avenue of closure after a cyberbullying incident. c) It is wrong for society to feel supported by their government, with reference to cyberbullying. 2) You have offered and elaborated a counter model in this debate, of education. Please tell me how education deals with: a) The bullies once they have offended b) The victims who have already been hurt c) Society once a victim has been hurt 3) I think the best cure for cyberbullying would be prevention. Could you tell us why my model of criminalization does not prevent cyberbullying, with reference to all of my (heretofore unresponded) analysis that the law is an effective deterrant. 4) Could you now tell us why your model of education prevents cyberbullying, with reference to my unresponded-to analysis that education without a legal aspect achieves nothing? 5) In this debate you've tried to tell us that education is superior to criminalization, as if one would cancel the other. Do you not believe, in the back of your mind, that if we had both that would be ideal? Why do you think the two sides to this debate are mutually exclusive? Have you not fallen in to the trap of giving voters a false dichotomy? If your answer to any of the above is ""true,"" then please tell us how you have fulfilled your onus to knock down my argument, being the neg. 6) I gave analysis in my last speech as to why education is indeed less effective than criminalization. I told you it gives accountability and removes the joy of suffering. Respond. I'd like to thank my opponent for a great debate and look forward to the conclusion rounds."

""people should not be depressed from insults"" - so ladies and gentlemen you hear that, the affirming believes if you are called something, lets say ""fat"", then you shouldn't be offended by it. Imagine if you are called fatty, or flat chest, man boobs, anything and you could not take offence to it, you just had to move on with your life, this purely gives the bullies every right to keep saying it until it becomes a normal online greeting. Imagine looking down to your phone to see the words in bold on texts say ""greetings fat person"" or imagine even a friend or family member seeing the text. ""its their choice to kill themselves"" - well in the majority of countries it is illegal to kill yourself. if u are suggesting that suicide is ok in this world you are defying laws, if you wanted to make suicide legal as well you should have once again included this in your setup. ""taking an insult is not an important issue, called a get over it and move on"" - so people who do take offence should just suffer and end up illegally killing themselves with no choice of will because their minds are overpowered with emotions of sadness, not help should be given??? ""people would get over petty insults"" - is this purely based on ones assumption because u said that you where only going to use facts and logic??? and what are you going to do with the people who dont get over the so called petty insults? Do you take into consideration that some insults are not actually ""petty""? ""there are worse things in the world than cyberbullying"" - yes, we agree however that does not mean you should just stop caring about the people who are cyberbullied. "" people will realise how petty cyberbullying really is"" - im gathering another assumption??? also would this really happen if you remove all help towards people who are cyberbullied, don't you think people would realise how bad of a problem it is, no councilling and help for these people would only make the issue greater. ""we should make it so that people realise how stupid and petty cyberbullying really is"" - how are you going to do this!!!! why wasn't this listed in your setup??? and is child abduction and rape petty??? because online web chats and stuff all lead to this. ""whether its their fault or not there will always be weak people"" - We need to help these weak people, for all we know you could be one of the weak people and you would be crying when you don't have help. Affirming's point 9 refers to no articles suggesting cyber bullying has lead to physical violence. However, without even needing to do research it is very clear that self-violence which is physical can be caused via cyberbullying. Let alone rape and abduction cases caused by web chat sites, whether you admit it or not this is a form of cyber bullying, and even cyber bullying with calling names etc leads to meeting up in real life to have a fight. ""more important issues in the world"" - of course, global warming, health care, education........etc. But the one the affirming team suggested in their opening case was about fish poop in food and water. What a great substitute for cyberbullying. Ladies and gentlemen you have witnessed this yourself, the affirming team believe that fish poop in food and water (which when does that happen) is more important than depression and suicide. They have got their priorities in the wrong place. Then furthermore reading your case I came across you telling me how a debate should work and you saying ""that is simply not how a debate works, you can't point to a problem and complain about it without giving a solution. Well ladies and gentlemen don't get me wrong but isn't this statement are representation of the whole affirming's case? They have told us a problem in saying that cyber bullying should not be looked at as a problem, but not told us how they are going to go about forming a solution? Very hypocritical and contradicting of your case. ""and by the way with the insults. This is a debate not a youtube comments section"" - the insult was purely a challenged conclusion and again is it not hypocritical to state that when you stated the cyberbullying comments are just something stupid like ""ur dum lol"", is that not an insult to every single human being that has being cyber bullied and has suffered depression, is that not offensive to all the people who have wanted to kill themselves for when people have said cruel things much more than your stereotypical ""ur dum lol"". HOW DO YOU THINK ALL THOSE INNOCENT LIVES WOULD FEEL WHEN THEY THINK THAT THEIR LIVES BEING DESTROYED IS BECUASE OF JUST SOME ""ur dum lol"" comment. ""i have not seen or heard from anything that involving cyberbullying that has made me think ""wow, what a sad and depressing cyberbullying article"" - again!!! what is with the personal opinions, for all we know you could be a cyber bully and you have no emotions at all, what happend to the facts? ""its their choice its none of our business if they get stupid and decide to kill themselves"" - it is against the law to kill yourself in most countries and we need to help the people who try to kill themselves. Also do you take no emotion to suicide? you havent denied that it is problem in cyber bullying but yet you state you haven't found anything that made you think ""wow what a sad and depressing... Again if you want to change the laws involving suicide please in future list this in your setup. ""because cyber bullying is a person miles from you saying mean things"" - did you ever think of stalkers faking their identity living across the road, or maybe even a friend from school, anyone can cyber bully you very opinionated and stereotypical of you to say ""miles away"" Then finally we come into a conclusion of your case when you basically list some solution to preventing cyber bullying. But wait a minute why are you trying to prevent cyberbullying when you just want to make them suffer and try and get over it. In future please try and make the points and ideas you are trying to get across more straight forward because I am left totally puzzled on what you are even trying to change in this world. Simply this is how you should lay out your case: //////////////////////// Introduction point 1 - main point (principle) and how you are going to go about making this change. point 2 point 3 Conclusion ///////////////////////// Once you can understand the basic concept structure you could then move onto created it more defensive or offensive. Before your eyes ladies and gentlemen we have a case that is leading way in favour of the negating rather than the affirmative. The affirmative have delivered an unclear case as to what they are even going to do, they have brought in self-opinions with no factual evidence and have even stated material defying some laws to do with suicide. They have stereotyped what cyberbullying really is and offended lots of people along the way. I really feel sympathetic for the affirming to try and bring their case back together for their introductory can no longer be changed."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying

80	S5be89fb-Aabecd50e	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyberbullying that is held outside of school should be punished by the school.	"Though it is agreed that bullying in school is an issue, it is often handled quickly. This debate is on cyberbullying outside of school. Cyber bullying often does not carry into the next school day when schools handle the bullying and don't allow social media websites at school or cell phones. If students were following the rules than the cyberbullying could not be carried on into the next day. Also, yet again, If the student really wanted the cyberbullying to go away, why would they not delete their account? or block the bullies? or, as you can often do on today's' social media, set your account as private. Now to the Amanda Todd case, though she did not deserve what happened to her, is there at all an argument that she brought it onto herself? About 1 in 5 teens have posted or sent sexually suggestive or nude pictures of themselves to others which results in a huge percentage of the cyberbullying. Though if those pictures had never been sent, how could the bullying ever have happened? If Amanda Todd had never ""flashed"" the boy she was video chatting with, would bullying have ever been an issue for her? Amanda Todd was also twelve years of age when she did this act, with the age limit on all social media being thirteen years of age, she should have never been on the social media in the first place. One-hundred percent of bullying over inappropriate pictures would be avoided if the pictures had never been sent or the acts had never been made. The schools do often also take charge in bullying in school, though when schools get too involved, they are often sued for exceeding their authority and violating the students free speech right. There are many things that schools attempt to do to take action but cyberbullying outside of school, can not be handled by the school. Only 4% of any bullying is brought back into school and is handled immediately."	CON	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	Scd58e68-A4adbcaf6	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Whould women be allowed in combat type MOS's within the US Armed Forces	"As we all know, there is no longer a designated frontline that protects a soldier from being in combat. The days of a battle front in a war are over. When a service man or woman is checking vehicles in Afghanistan, and the vehicle explodes due to a car bomb, that soldier is killed in combat. When female soldiers are the first ones to knock on doors in a neighborhood in Afghanistan due to cultural restrictions, they are essentially at the point-woman of a potential fire mission. We no longer have a choice but to recognize that female soldiers are in the battlefield and leading missions in nontraditional combat zones. This is a matter of fact given that fifteen percent of the military is comprised of women. Over 200,000 women have dedicated their lives to serve the United States and 20,000 of whom served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where in these countries does the theater of operations begin or end. My opponent states ""that the average male is physically superior to the average female. There are certain things that females cannot be expected to do, due to limitations in strength."" It is not reasonable to assume that the ""average"" women can operate at the same capacity, and perform the same tasks, as men when in a combat environment. The woman who have proven capable of operating in such an environment have demonstrated a superior capacity than their ""average"" male counterpart. As my opponent correctly indicated, the average male is stronger than the average female. However, according to Marine Lt. Gen. Robert Milstead, deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, none of the standards males have traditionally been required to meet have been lowered for woman[1]. No lower bar has been set for female recruits, yet, select females have exceeded their own gender based standard and met and/or exceeded the higher standard set for men. This is what justifies and merits a combat role for women who met the requirements. If it""s good enough for an average male, it is certainly good enough for a superior female. My opponent summarizes his argument of male physical superiority over females by stating, ""Although the PT is grueling, it is in no way a testament to ones ability to perform a combat role. Therefor, ones ability to pass this course is not a point that should be considered in allowing females to serve in combat.[sic]"" I would like to challenge this statement. If it is not based on physical ability, what ""point"" should be considered allowing females to serve in combat? Military analysts agree the debate over whether women should serve in infantry and other direct ground combat roles has come to this: Are they physically strong enough? The U.S. military services have launched an extensive effort to verify the specific physical requirements needed to succeed in each of dozens of fields that had been closed to women. As previously stated, the military will not need to lower its physical standards as it opens direct combat jobs to women.[2] The second point my opponent makes is accommodating privacy for female combatants in the field. While this is a valid point of contention "" the truth is, it is not as relevant or as big a problem as it sounds. In Iraq, most combat patrols began in the green zone in the early morning dawn and ended at evening. There were specialized combat roles at night for specific raids, but these patrols operated out of an established base where both combatants and non-combatants slept. In the event a female combatant needed to sleep in the field or improvise a latrine for use, it is not unreasonable to expect the female to perform this duty the same way males do. All combatants give up any reasonable expectation of their privacy in the field. I do not see how this would be any different for females. Additionally, it would not be difficult for the chain of command to ensure both the males and females respected certain aspects of the other genders daily rituals. Provisioning this would not be difficult for a leader. My opponent further stated ""Like it or not the number one priority in the armed forces is mission accomplishment, and after that comes troop welfare."" I will agree with my opponent with this assertion. Accordingly, due to cultural sensitivities in Middle Eastern theaters of operation, female soldiers are being taken on combat missions to search village women. According to Pfc, Adalina Roman, a 19 year-old supply specialist, B Co., 307th FSB. The Afghan women are sensitive about being seen by people who are not members of their family. They are sometimes upset when even female soldiers try to search them. ""They""re really scared; one woman was so upset she lost control of her bowels when asked to stand up."" Women are not the only ones who get emotional when searched. Brady mentioned one man who became hysterical, started crying and choking when he saw his wife being searched. This prompted all the women to start crying and Brady had to get the already very busy interpreter to help calm them all down. [3] Can you imagine how dangerous and difficult this task would be if US service members were searching Middle Eastern woman for explosives. It would enrage the traditional patriarch society. Modern warfare involves many tactics and strategies, today""s modern battlefield is as much ""hearts and minds"" as it is physical combat. In a conflict where hearts and minds are important delicate handling of local people is required in order gain their support. In these conflicts, women are often better suited to intelligence gathering, medical assistance, policing and mediation than men. They are often perceived as less threatening and more understanding.[4] In addition, they would be better placed to deal with women in the local population. My opponent finalizes his position by basically stating ""Now I am not claiming that this is WWII and the threat is around every corner, so we need to fix bayonets and eat our Wheaties every morning just in case. What I am saying is it [hand-to-hand combat] still happens. And when it does happen it is not with a female, it is with a male opponent. I like my chances knowing that I have a stronger and faster individual watching my back."" As previously indicated a modern battlefield does have combat and on rare occasion, involves hand to hand combat. This is the exception to the rule and certainly not the norm. When small arms are the primary means of defense and offense, size and speed is irrelevant. Since the end of the Cold war, wars have become ""less frequent and less deadly"". In the past, wars were often fought between large armies with heavy weaponry, but many modern conflicts are L.I.C.s (low intensity conflicts), involving small terrorist groups with guerilla tactics. [5] Women have shown great courage and sacrifice on and off the battlefield, contributed in unprecedented ways to the military's mission and proven their ability to serve in an expanding number of roles. Women have always fought and died in America's wars. As of 2010, over 600 women have died in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. They've led men in battle, been prisoners of war, fired lethal weapons, and operated our most sophisticated systems. They fly combat aircraft, serve on combat ships and have killed the enemy. Women meet the military's physical and mental standards, are technically proficient, and are highly trained war fighters and leaders. It is for these reasons I maintain woman should fill combat roles in today's military. [1] USA Today HYPERLINK http://www.usatoday.com... [2] USA Today http://www.usatoday.com...

80	S9a4f3541-A4bf3943c	2	2	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyber bullying should be a criminal offense	"Resolved: Cyber bullying should be a criminal offense. On balance, I stand in opposition to this resolution. Cyberbullying is defined by Dictionary.com as the act of harassing someone online by sending or posting mean messages, usually anonymously. As for a criminal offense it is defined as an act punishable by law; usually considered an evil act.” Now for my first contention: today we continue to push for matters such as cyberbullying to be handled by an already under resourced police department rather than by programs such as the Dignity Act for All Students. This Act was implemented in July 1st of 2010. My first sub point is that the Dignity Act requires school districts to report problems with bullying to the State Educational department and furthermore, this program mandates that schools adopt programs to educate people and counteract the problem with bullying. Secondly, Justin Patchin, co-director of the national cyberbullying research center for the past 10 years, and professor at the University of Wisconsin says “There are better alternatives than criminalizing cyberbullies.” Patchin says that schools and families should become more involved with the lives of students. Patchin also says “We know from decades of research that teens are not deterred by threats of formal punishment. They are more likely to be deterred by relationships they care about within the school, and what their friends think.” In other words, Finally, if schools really strive to teach that bullying is wrong and if students learn that bullying will be punished with in the schools, then the need to make cyberbullying a crime will be deterred by the programs being taught in the school. Now for my second contention, in the process of being bullied one must learn to understand that bullies are often victims in other contexts. Sub point A: according to the Berkman center for Society and Internet at Harvard University Danah Boyd and John Palfrey say “Bullies aren’t the source of the problem, they are often a symptom.” Many times bullies have had some form of power taken away from them and therefore lash out in situations where they have control. Boyd and Palfrey also say that “We must have empathy for those who hurt and for those who are being hurt. Recognizing this is crucial to stopping the cycle of bullying.” This leads us to our next sub point. Yes, cyber bullying is awful and it can create problems in an individual, however we have to understand and help those who bully. Each individual responds to difficulties in a different way, and just because someone is being hurt doesn’t mean we ignore the person who is hurting; therefore we should help both of the people. This can be done by enforcing more group focused activities, support groups, and counseling in the school this can help to end the cycle of bullying. Now for my third contention. It is the fact that feelings are inconsistent and vary from individual to individual. First, how can the government measure something that is inconsistent and then deliver a sentence based on the varying emotions of a hormonal teenager. Hanni Flakhoury, staff lawyer at the Electronic Freedom Foundation, says “If you hurt a 15 year olds feelings really bad, do you go to jail for that?” That is a valid question to ask. In the process of cyberbullying no one is physically hurt, their feelings just are. Grant it, there are cases in which an individual commits suicide. However, can cyberbullying be the only cause for the suicide victim of online harassment? Maybe, most likely not. For example, in the Clementi’s case Tyler Clementi committed suicide because his sexual orientations were displayed online by his roommate Dharun Ravi. However, can we really say that Ravi was responsible for the death of Clementi? In this specific case, along with many others, one comes to the specific problem of morality. Grant it, what Ravi did was not correct, however what about the morality of Clementi? Our final sub points are: Why would he commit suicide if what he was doing was morally correct? Why would he commit suicide if he wasn’t ashamed of what he was doing? All these points lead to this: that though Ravi acted in an EXTREMELY unjust way we must understand that Ravi was perhaps not the only reason for Clementi’s suicide. Cyberbullying should not be a criminal offense firstly because the United States of America already has enough criminal offenses and is already under resourced, secondly because we often forget to sympathize with the bully, and thirdly because feelings are inconsistent and immeasurable.

80	S97e8d9cb-A1d6ce69b	0	0	How can we combat cyberbullying?	cyberbullying isn't a real issue.	"to start off, your entire 2nd paragraph is invalid to this argument because BULLYING in REAL LIFE is an issue, which is what I'm arguing. A person harassing another in person is COMPLETELY different than the same thing happening online, for many reasons. The #1 reason being that in person, the victim cannot simply turn off or mute the bully from speaking to them directly while ONLINE there is a TREMENDOUS amount of different ways to mute or turn off the offender's comments (or simply not read/look at them). Not to mention, hearing the words come out of a person's mouth is MUCH more harmful than looking at them, (although I do agree that reading them CAN be harmful, and has been in most cases). I have to also include that I have experienced ""cyberbullying"" to the MAX. Although I wont go into detail, when I was younger I had at one point had over 20 hatepages on instagram and would receive HUNDREDS of hate comments/messages a day. Though I thought it was a huge deal at the time, I found that if I simply deleted the messages before reading them, there was no harm done to myself AND I could keep my apps. At one point that did become a bit much to do, so I just deleted the account altogether because my happiness and mental stability is FAR more important than a silly app. The point that ""Logging out, yeah sure it stops the harassment for a little bit, but if that is your only source of communicating with say businesses or something, then you have to log back in and still receive all the messages and stuff."" is true, sure, but if the messages were infact THAT bad, there's always the option of making a new account and only giving it to the people whom you want, so that the ""bullies"" no longer have communication and you may continue using the app for whatever purposes you must. I do know that mental disorders come from bullying, and that some may even develop from cyberbullying, BUT I have to argue that cyberbullying in general isn't a threat unless you let it be one. There are infinite ways to stop the harassment and those who let it happen have put it on themselves, for not stopping it before it got to them mentally. I simply cannot agree that something which can be stopped with the click of a button is an issue."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S50da0ef-A471aba3b	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Women should not be allowed to serve in Infantry	"“ This makes little to no sense, especially as part of an argument concerning rights; the existence of a draft, that involuntarily forces individuals to serve in the armed forces, is a violation of rights in and of itself. Of course women being involuntarily conscripted into the military would be a violation of their rights; it is also a violation of the rights of men who are involuntarily conscripted. This has no impact on the 'validity' of men serving in combat positions, and it has no impact on the 'validity' of women serving in combat positions. It certainly has no bearing on whether or not they should serve in combat positions voluntarily. Which is the issue being debated, if I'm not mistaken; there is a reason volunteer-only militaries are invariably better than conscripted ones, and there is a reason a majority of first world countries no longer have a 'draft'. Involuntary military service has nothing to do with this issue.” The point of this argument is not to show that women’s rights are necessarily being violated because of the draft. The point however, is to show that the few women who want this to happen make the majority of women suffer, since they want to have the same career freedom as men do. Women want many rights in this country, but women who push for this are really going to see the consequences of their actions upon the female population in America. “I believe your comment was cut off. Combat is 'designed' for combat; it is designed for people to kill one another, in order to gain or press some advantage on their opponent, in a military sense. No gender is necessarily 'required' for this. One is only required to be physically fit, healthy and reasonably above average in strength. Modern advances and practices continue to 'lower' this bar, though a rather high level of fitness will always be required. Combat, in itself, is not qualitatively 'different' to any other physically intensive activity. You do not need to be at the total, absolute peak of physical human ability to be considered for a place in a combat role; you need only be 'good enough'. That might sound a tad stupid, but there you have it. If every single potential infantryman had to be essentially a Dionysian demigod to be considered 'fit enough', we would have no infantry; it really is as simple as that. The minimum standards for joining combat positions are objectively quite high, but it is faulty to say that women are incapable of meeting those standards, and denying at least the opportunity to those who have clearly demonstrated that they are physically capable of such a position, purely on the grounds of their gender, is not 'good forward thinking', it's sexism.” The problem with this statement is that Con sees the standard as somewhat naïve, and just as another “physical” routine that you do. Combat is a physical and mental routine that prepares soldiers for real war. Con looks at the standard as though it were easy because he is looking at it from a male perspective. Most women would not be able to lift and carry a 200-pound man with an additional 30+ pounds of gear for several miles or more every day of infantry training. I think the Human anatomy examples clarify my point. Privacy is another issue. Our men on the front lines spend weeks with each other in secluded areas, in which they take care of their “business” in front of one another. Whether that be personal hygiene or attending to matters generally taken care of in the bathroom. Would some women be able to adjust? Sure. Would most? I don’t believe so. The society we live in instills the belief that the life of women and children are of greater value than men. Reference nearly every war movie. Veterans come home every day, but continue to struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder. It would not be a smart move to inflict further strain on our brave men by placing them in a situation to witness the death of a woman. Do we really need more body bags for women as we do men? I don’t think so. “One woman, who by all accounts should have been able to endure the ardors of the job, was unable to. Therefore, her entire gender is also unable to, whether or not they meet the same standards and have the 'appearance' of being able to. Surely you can see how this is fallacious? This only qualifies the argument that women should be 'kept out' of combat positions inasmuch as they are not truly physically fit enough to be able to perform such a job. This is the same standard men are held to. It does not qualify a blanket ban on all women, because they are women, regardless of their individual fitness or qualification for such a position. As per the 'Pentagon 2016' statement you have shown, actual standards for joining in a combat role will not be lowered or changed to 'accommodate' women; if such standards are insufficient to ensure that all who pass them are actually fit enough for the job, they should be raised/reworked across the board, for both genders. Undoubtedly there will still be women who are capable of passing the increased standards and performing well in said position.” How does Con know that women will do well in the current standard of combat? So far no woman has met the standard, and very few want to. The decision to open ground-combat positions to women is seriously misguided, as evidenced by the fact that the policy decision precedes the feasibility assessment. A senior Defense Department official announced that the goal is ""to provide a level, gender-neutral playing field,"" when the goal should be to have the most effective war-fighting institution possible. Again The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units. Then, of course, there's pregnancy, which leaves women three to four times as likely as men to be unable to deploy and leads many, once deployed, to be med-evaced and thereby lost to their units. Cambit units are intensely cooperative and placing a scarce resource (women) within them creates a disruptive competition. Moreover, trust is the foundation of cohesion, and men are disinclined to trust women in dangerous situations, worried that they will lack either the will or the wherewithal to back them up. The rough camaraderie that men engage in to build cohesion will lead to sexual harassment charges by women, so women will be excluded from these important activities. As you can see, there are too many problems with putting women in gender-neutral infantry units. Women will not be up to par when war-time comes calling in. Women would put a setback on the squad’s role or objective in war. This could seriously cost lives for women and men involved in the whole unit because a female soldier is not on the same level as her male-counterpart. I rest my case.

80	Sf8bea737-A24da99eb	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Bullying should be allowed	"Let's start off by defining some terms Bullying- According to {stopbullying.gov} , bullying is ""unwanted, aggressive behavior among school-aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. Allow- a. to admit as legal or acceptable; b. to give the necessary time or opportunity for So, this resolution, in other words, is to prove that aggressive action should be deemed acceptable. I will dissect my arguments into a few points. -Perspective- Bullying, in the eyes of the victim, is the actions against them personally, that can make them fell unwanted or unaccepted. This can lead to feelings of depression. [http://www.stopbullying.gov...] Bullying, in the eyes of the bully, is teasing or more serious annoying. To them, the victim is not affected, as most of the venting is done at home through crying from the victim. So, perhaps to the bully, things seem okay, and no one seems to be affected by the almost one-sided aggression. From a different perspective, bullying can seems like a totally different relationship. {P1} Builds character Personal Anecdote- Since I am a guy, I have seen 'bullying' more than girls probably have. Since boys playfully tease one another, we all know not to take it seriously. So, here's a series of events: (Verbal Bullying) Event 1: Bullying by peers When I was bullied in third grade, I never seemed to take it seriously. Fourth and fifth grade, the terms ""gay"" used a derogatory insult was thrown around like it was a competition. Event 2: Acceptance When these terms were tossed around, rather than feel offended, I just laughed. Perhaps some people were genuinely mean, but their words couldn't hurt me. Event 3: Resilience As the amount of insults increased, so did my age and my character. As a guy, I became accustomed to constant insults and belittling comments. Event 4: Progession and Growing Now that I am much older, I am much more thick-skinned. No barrage of comments can affect me, and I have, in effect, become impermeable to whatever people say to me. I have heard so many insults, but they no longer affect me because I am confident in myself, and know that others insult me because they are insecure of themselves. {Side-note to Con- Show confidence when you face your bullies. Let them know that what they say doesn't hurt you anymore. You are a strong, young person, and nothing they say affects you, because we all know how good of a person you are.} (That should not be counted as part of the debate.) {P2} Experience, Lesson Now that you understand my back-story, you know that I have experience. Since I faced comments and actions against me, I will not be shocked by them in the future. When others around me are rude, like classmates and co-workers, I will have experience how to deal with them. How would I deal with them? In a similar way my younger self dealt with his assailants. I will simply laugh and show that what they say does not affect me, because it doesn't. I am confident in myself and my abilities, and nothing they say can take that from me. Also, who are they to judge? They have their own flaws and faults, but by being the better person, I will not exploit those and reveal them to the world. {Side-note to Con- Since you have experienced bullying for a while, you have experience. Show those around you that you don't care what they say. By the way you told that story, I know you are a smart person, so don't let those who are dumb around you stop you from achieving your dreams. Stay strong!} {P3} Future You are/were a young kid when you got bullied, as was I. However, we must leave the past behind, and look ahead for the future. If children handled 'bullying' the way I did, which included verbal, mental, and sometimes physical aggression, they would become a stronger individual afterwards. Now, in the future of my bullying past, I can stand strong and poised, confident in myself, with the knowledge that what they say is untrue, and they are simply jealous of my better qualities, or insecure in their own. Now that I am older, the comments get worse, but my reaction does not change. I do not react. I am not weak, I am strong. I am not stupid, I am smart. I am not small, I am bigger than them. I am not worthless, I will make a difference in this world. It is not a crime to be different, I am unique. ""They laugh at me because I am different, I laugh at them because they are all the same."" {If you face bullying, that's what you should think. Be strong, Be confident!} In conclusion, bullying, whether physical, mental, emotional, or verbal, should be allowed. It gives kids experience and the opportunity to build self confidence. It teaches them to stand up for themselves, and trains their body and mind not to react to any actions against them. It gives them experience and strength to handle aggression when they're older, and more independent. I, like other victims, having endured bullying, can now stand poised, confident that nothing they say will affect them, and that no one can hurt them, now matter how hard they hit. We will stand strong and tall, without a fear in our minds. {Remember Con- Nothing they can say will hurt you. You are beautiful and smart, they are simply just jealous. Stay strong!} Thank you. http://www.stopbullying.gov... http://www.stopbullying.gov... https://www.google.com..."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying
80	S41078143-A18be91c1	1	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Resolved: cyberbullying should be a criminal offence	"This is a Public Forum Debate. Those that don't know Public Forum format, don't accept this debate. Round 1 will be Speech 1. Round 2 will be Crossfire 1. Round 3 will be Speech 2. Round 4 will be Crossfire 2. Round 5 will be Summary. ----------- Making cyberbullying a criminal offense is ridiculous. Not only would convicting a cyberbully be extremely difficult, but more importantly, making cyberbullying a crime would not reduce the damage caused by bullying. In addition, current laws are adequate in dealing with cyberbullying. Contention 1: convicting a cyberbully would be extremely difficult According to law professor Susan Brenner and juris doctor Megan Rehberg, to get a conviction against a defendant for bombarding someone with emotionally distressing messages, one needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause the inflicted harm. This is very difficult, especially if only one harmful message was sent. How does one know what another's intentions are? How does one prove to others what they are? In the case of harassment, the act of harassing or annoying someone, the Supreme Court has ruled that the term annoy is too vague, as something that annoys one will not annoy another. Getting around this ruling would be an astronomical challenge. Convicting (and making a law against cyberbullying) is made even more difficult by the First Amendment, which states that ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.""(http://topics.law.cornell.edu...) Today's press and conversations reside at least partially on the Internet. To place restrictions on what one can type on the Internet would be a clear violation of the First Amendment. Although an exception to the First Amendment is speech that harms children, that applies mainly to television and radio at certain times. Speech on the Internet has full First Amendment protection. Contention 2: the damage from bullying cannot be reduced by criminalizing it Bullying is an act that commonly occurs in schools of all regions and income levels. Cyberbullying is no different. Is cyberbullying any less damaging to the individual and to society than traditional bullying? Should we turn a blind eye on traditional bullying and vainly assert our authority over cyberspace? Is traditional bullying even possible to prevent? Apparently not, since it has and continues to occur in our best schools. Cyberbullying is also impossible to prevent. According to jezebel.com, ""45 states now have some sort of anti-cyberbullying law, but harassment researcher Catherine Hill says there's no indication yet that they actually prevent bullying."" If it's not possible to prevent any type of bullying, what use is it to turn the government's attention towards cyberbullying? How many lives can we truly save when we cannot prevent victims from being abused? The answer to cyberbullying is not law enforcement, but social education. According to Newsday, ""Statistics from the state Department of Education show a nearly 11 percent decline on the Island in incidents reported as intimidation or bullying from 2006-2007 to 2008-2009. Long Island schools offer many types of anti-bullying programs."" People need to be educated on how to deal with abusive and relentless people. People need to know what to do when they are abused or when someone they know is abused. People need to know that suicide is not the answer and that there are better solutions to their problems. The government would get much greater returns investing their money in social education rather than new prisons for cyberbullies. Contention 3: current laws are adequate when dealing with cyberbullying According to the Congressional Research Service, limitations on the freedom of speech and press are obscenities (profanity), child pornography, true threats, inciting panic when there's no danger, and defamation (slander and libel). The types of cyberbullying are spreading rumors, targeting, identity theft, sharing embarrassing photos and e-mails, excluding, and harassment (according to the Media Awareness Network). Spreading rumors is defamation and is illegal. Identity theft is illegal. Sharing photos of a minor without their parents' permission is illegal. Harassment based on any trait that cyberbullies could think of to attack is illegal. That means that most forms of cyberbullying are illegal. The forms that aren't illegal are forms of traditional bullying that are commonplace in schools. These should be dealt with by counselors, and not law officials. Therefore, it is evident that cyberbullying should not be a criminal offense. Convicting cyberbullies would be difficult, damage from bullying would not be reduced, and the new law would be over-controlling since current laws already solve the problem."

You have complete power in this situation, you can either choose to say that you will not care what they say or you can choose to just not look at the place on the internet where you are, and whether or not your feelings are hurt is irrelevant, the fact is that in this country we have the freedom of speech, which allows anyone to say anything without the interference of the government, and while you can try and persuade them to stop, it isn't illegal, so while I might agree with you that cyber-bullying sucks and is hurtful, they technically aren't doing anything wrong."" But, I am still on the internet because I was younger when it happened, around 3rd grade. I am older now and can handle it. I was on a little kid website where you can become friends and talk to other people. Even though there is freedom of speech, there is a point that goes too far. By the way, from the website, Freedom of Speech Versus Cyberbullying, they said that cyberbullying goes beyond of what the First Amendment covers. Also, even though you say it isn't illegal, it actually is. All of my websites that I have visited, they all said that it is illegal. According to criminal.findlaw.com, ""Nearly all states have bullying laws in place, many with cyberbullying or electronic harassment provisions. Cyberbullying is considered against the law, but most people aren't caught or stayed secretive."" So, my opponent said that cyberbullying isn't against the law, but actually it is."

Lastly, teen death and suicide is not stupid especially for the victim and victim's loved ones. Cyberbullying that happens outside of school, and affects school conduct, is one of the only cyberbullying acts that should be responded to in school.

80	S9a4f3541-A310aeb22	2	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Cyber bullying should be a criminal offense	"Hello! Sorry for the delay in my argument. Seeing as my opponent has deftly jumped into his argument from the first round, I will do my best to follow him in procedure. This should be a challenging debate. Let's begin, shall we?I. IntroductionFor my side of the argument, I logically and emotionally maintain the fact that cyberbullying should be taken seriously and, at serious degrees, be a criminal offense, and subject to fines at minimum, and imprisonment at the maximum. Pro has brought up a decent amount of excellent points, with which I mostly agree with. However, I will provide contradictions, cases, and reasoning to negate his/her argument.II. What Exactly is Cyberbullying?My opponent has already stated the dictionary definition: ""The act of harassing someone online by sending or posting mean messages, usually anonymously."" However, US Legal Definitions goes further, saying ""Cyber-bullying could be limited to posting rumors or gossips about a person in the Internet bringing about hatred in other’s minds; or it may go to the extent of personally identifying victims and publishing materials severely defaming and humiliating them.""[1] In many cases, cyberbullying applies to the first, official definition, and can easily be resolved in school environments. However, there are many situations of cyberbullying, such as these[2][3][4], when the victim goes far as to committing suicide.Now, I will bring up the definition of third-degree murder. According to the same website, US Legal Definitions, ""Third degree murder can be defined as homicide committed with the intention of causing bodily harm, but not necessarily death. It can be a killing that results from indifference or negligence or recklessness. Statutes defining third degree murder vary considerably from state to state.""[5] The connection is implied: cyberbullying that causes suicide could possibly be considered as third-degree murder. Now, third degree murder is usually considered as physical homicide, and bodily harm usually accounts for physical wounds. However, the harasser usually knows that what they're doing will humiliate and embarrass the victim, but do not intend to provoke him/her into committing suicide. There are multiple fines and short-term arrests because of third degree murder. If the victim commits suicide, then the bully was technically something of a third degree murderer. This is somewhat farfetched, but even if they don't count as a third degree murderer, they should be accounted as a criminal that falls short of that crime.II. Incapability of the School System and Law EnforcementMy opponent has stated before that since 2010, when the Dignity Act was ratified, schools have been taking more action into preventing cyberbullying. However, this information is grossly obsolete for such a current debate. There have been thousands of cases of cyberbullying since this act nonetheless, including hundreds when the victim attempted (sometimes successfully) suicide due to this.Statistics in an article created in 2012 (2 years after the Dignity Act) by CyberBullyHotline show that 42% of teens in 2012 were cyberbullied, 20% of them thought about suicide, and 10% of them attempted suicide, resulting in 4,500 successful suicidal situations total. [6] This could be 4,500 cases of possible aggravated harassment, third degree stalking, and third degree murder (although the murder is still an assumption). Schools have not significantly decreased the amount of cyberbullying, nor the suicide attempts. In fact, since 2010, the percentage of victims of cyberbullying has increased by 4%. [7] Any laws or regulations since 2010 has proved to be ineffective, and I dare to go further and even say they're technically futile and meaningless in terms of results. Statistics show that further law enforcement is needed in order to effectively decrease the amount of cyberbullied victims.III. Why Criminal Offense?My opponent has defined criminal offense as ""an act punishable by law; usually considered an evil act."" Many cases of cyberbullying, even ones that don't end with the victim's suicide, break several laws, each differing in degrees of severity.[8] Con's sources were all cases when the bully was arrested, but just because you commit a crime doesn't mean you go to jail. You can either pay fines, be on probation, or do community service. Minor criminals such as cyberbullies hardly deserve to be arrested, unless they resemble cases I have stated above. This is where I present my counter-plan. Cyberbullies are evidently unable to be repressed by school discipline, so we should give them varying levels or punishment, depending on the severity of their crimes. Here is the plan I propose in a numerical list:1. Level 1 Cyberbullying. This applies when the bully posts malicious comments and messages open to the general public. Punishments are rare, often able to be settled with a school warning, or a school board warning.2. Level 2 Cyberbullying. This applies when the bully shares personal information about the victim to intend harm, such as a photo, location, phone number, or email address to the general public. The bully could be sued for Publication of Private Facts, and given a suspension in the highest case. If this information is used by a third party to harm the victim, this immediately escalates to a Level 3.3. Level 3 Cyberbullying. This applies when the bully intentionally provokes the victim using obscene and sex-related comments, and encourages the public to do the same. If the bully or his/her accomplices commit an unlawful act to intentionally harm the victim, then it escalates to a Level 4 or he/she will be given a fine or community service along with school suspension. The bully could be charged for Abuse of Freedom of Speech, according to 18 U.S. Code Chapter 71.[9]4. Level 4 Cyberbullying. The bully directly indulges in breaking the law by severely harassing the victim, using inappropriate content such as nude pictures, threats to cause physical harm, and severely discriminative and obscene comments. If one or more of these acts apply to the bully, he or she could be given a short term of prison and immediately put on probation, along with community service and fines. Immediate school expulsion along with school board intervention is mandatory. The bully will be charged with material related to child pornography(18 U.S.C. § 2252A- certain activities relating to material constituting or containing child pornography)[10] and Threats of Violence Against Individuals,[11].5. Level 5 Cyberbullying. The bully distributes underage pornography of the victim, the victim physically gets severely injured by the bully or his/her accomplices, and provokes the victim to commit suicide. If any one of these acts are applied, the bully will be put in a prolonged term of prison, a heavy fine, and other punishments approved by the court. The bully will be charged with child pornography (18 U.S.C. § 2251- Sexual Exploitation of Children), maiming and mutilation(10 U.S. Code § 924),[12] and involuntary manslaughter at extreme cases (Model Penal Code § 210.3)[13]. IV. ConclusionAfter hours of extensive research, I maintain the belief that more severe cases of cyberbullying should be treated as a criminal offense. All of these laws regarding crime report that the offender must have ""intended to harm the victim"", and the bullies do mean to harm the victim mentally and emotionally to the point that they are physically and psychologically hurt from the bullying as well. Bullies almost always intend to hurt the victim. Logically, the bully knows what they are doing and know what their actions are, although they are blind to the consequences, which is not a valid defense for their wrongdoings. Therefore, cyberbullying is a criminal offense. I have laws, cases, and statistics to support my argument, instead of personal and mildly logical sources from my opponent. This debate's outcome has not been determined yet. I wish good luck to Con, and will await his second argument!V.

80	S4ee7a703-Ae123263	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Tom Brady Did not deserve to get suspended	"1. The Wells Report has zero credibility Although it""s been said many times, many ways, it bears repeating that Ted Wells and his law firm have made millions working for the NFL in the concussion lawsuits and stand to log quadrillions of hours of billable hours in the future. He is as ""independent"" an investigator as Kato Kaelin would have been investigating O.J. And as I""ve pointed out before, Exponent, the consulting lab that Wells hired, has long been notorious for telling clients whatever they want to hear, from tobacco not causing cancer to dumping toxic waste into the Amazon being a pure good. If the mayor of Amity Island hired these people, they would have ruled Chrissie Watkins really did die in a boating accident. 2. Wells conducted a witch hunt and still didn""t come up with any proof This entire investigation hinges on the simple question of whether or not someone working for the Patriots took air out of the footballs after the officials tested them. Without proof of that, all this business of what Thing 1 was texting to Thing 2 and whether the world""s most recognizable quarterback knew a low-level, part-time official""s locker room attendant is irrelevant. And they failed to find it. In fact, the report contradicts its own ""conclusions"" with statements such as ""those measurements show that there was no tampering because most of the footballs fell within the 11.52 to 11.32 psi for halftime, as predicted by the Ideal Gas Law."" (Side note: Now that the Ideal Gas Law is codified into this thing as accepted science, is that fraud Bill Nye going to get back to us on how he said the whole thing is nonsense?) And Brady""s crime is that he was ""at least generally aware"" of this allegation they did not prove. 3. Tom Brady did not lie to investigators Much has been made of Brady""s assertion ""he did not know [Jim] McNally""s name or anything about McNally""s game-day responsibilities,"" which strains credibility for some since, as we are so often reminded, McNally is a 32-year Patriots employee. Except McNally wasn""t working with Tom Brady, John Jastremski was. But in fact, even he hasn""t been in charge of prepping game-day balls for very long. The guy who took care of that for Brady for years retired last year. And according to people I""ve spoken to, even he will admit it took him five years to learn to get it right. This notion that McNally has been Alfred the Butler to Brady""s Bruce Wayne all these years is an outright fiction. He""s the official""s locker room attendant, and Brady would no sooner have to be familiar with his name than you know the name of the guy who hands you a towel in the men""s room at a nice restaurant. 4. Tom Brady did not ""not cooperate"" with investigators He spent an entire day cooperating. The fact that he refused to turn over his private communications to people conducting an investigation that had more leaks than the Titanic wasn""t being uncooperative, it was sound judgment. Read those messages going back and forth between two friends and how those are portrayed and tell me you""d hand yours over to these McCarthyites. I wouldn""t, and my image isn""t the face of several billion-dollar companies. Which brings us to: 5. Ted Wells has no idea how guys text each other As he did with the Richie Incognito-Jonathan Martin investigation, Wells proves he hasn""t the first damn clue how men talk to other men. Guy-speak to him might as well be the Windtalker""s code. ""F- Tom"" is portrayed as genuine anger. Stuff about expecting some Uggs and memorabilia is made out to be an extortion racket. Every text he included in the report he interpreted in the worst possible light. They may have been. Only the people doing the texting know for sure, which is why private communication is supposed to be private. Because an outsider will always interpret what you and your friend say the way they want to, not how it was meant. Everything Wells put in this report that was said between Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (stick tap to my buddy Nick) is his opinion. Not fact. And still there""s not a smoking gun to be found. 6. The psi ""data"" is a disgraceful mess I said this last week, officials not only used two gauges that gave different results, they can""t even say which one was which. Or they blame discrepancies on ""transcription errors."" And while the national pundits are late to the party, I""m glad they showed up. Peter King points out that at halftime the footballs should have been in the 11.32 to 11.52 range, and with one gauge it was. Taking both gauges together they were 11.30, which is all of 0.02 psi low. And Mike Florio weighs in with the observation that according to Walt Anderson""s ""best recollection"" in the pregame he tested the balls with the gauge that had the Pats well within the range. That would prove no tampering to anyone who didn""t have an agenda. But investigators instead basically badgered Anderson to admit it""s ""possible"" he used the other gauge. Anderson""s ""recollections"" are fine, so long as they fit the predetermined narrative. When they don""t, they""re ignored. 7. Precedent is on the side of no suspension As pointed out by Mike Reiss and others, when the Chargers were deemed to have used towels covered with Stickum to coat the footballs, then hid the towels from officials looking into it, they were fined $20,000. They appealed and got off the hook. Last November when the Panthers were caught warming up the footballs with sideline heaters in Minnesota, they were told to knock it off, period. When Mark Schlereth got caught lubing up his jersey with Astroglide or whatever, he was fined five grand. The NFL""s own game-day operations manual says anyone caught monkeying around with footballs after the referee has approved them faces a penalty of, but not limited to, a fine of $25,000. Now, I get what ""not limited to"" means. But if the league thinks so much of the sanctity of the footballs that they set the punishment at the cost of a 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe, how do we make the leap the Deflategate truthers and anti-Patriots zealots are making that Brady, whom a 100-day investigation could not pin anything on, deserves a suspension. Why not just put him in the stockade or sentence him to amputation while we""re at it? This investigation stunk to high heaven. The final report is a hatchet job slanted with opinion, conjecture and spin. The science wouldn""t pass muster in a freshman Introduction to Physical Science midterm. And the punishment being discussed by the legion of Patriots cyberbullies doesn""t come close to fitting the crime. But still the witch hunt goes on. As for me, I""m standing by hoping that Brady demands Trial by Combat, and I pledge myself right now to be his champion. I shall take no wife, hold no lands and father no children. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the wall. I am the shield that guards the realm of Brady, for this night and all the nights to come."	PRO	combat cyberbullying	combat cyberbullying

Firstly, perpetrators are much less likely to hold back or be cautious as they are less concerned with the possibility of being caught. This means the bullying is likely to be more intense than when it is done in real life.[1] Additionally, for victims of cyberbullying, being unable to tell who your harasser is, or even how many there are can be particularly distressing.[2] Anonymous posting being significantly less available takes away the particularly damaging anonymous potential of cyberbullying, and allows cyberbullying to be more effectively dealt with.

80	Sf0770da-A760eca8e	0	1	How can we combat cyberbullying?	Homosexual Marriage and Lifestyle: Detrimental and Not Necessarily About Equality.	"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight.

IVF Debate	"As genetic screening may be a benefit for a leap in technological innovation and knowledge, it still doesn't hide the problem as to discarding embryos that are not beneficial for the patients who participate. Moral issues surround this, as the embryo can be though of as a human being or a possible chance of life in which will be disposed simple because there is a problem with the genetic makeup. In fact, many can argue that human reproduction is a gift and any form of selection can lead to speculations about a child being 'manufactured' rather than allowing the human reproduction cycle take its natural course. Moreover, by allowing us to gain an insight on disease and treating it before live birth, some may argue that we will be moving toward a society where we value children for their genotype rather than unique, individual characteristics.

52	Scee72b1d-Ab8645f14	0	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Homosexuality is Natural and gay marriage should be legalized	"1) Gene theory) True the Gene theory is yet to be conclusively proven so to fully accept the theory would be intellectually dishonest, but since the majority of the findings not only support but indicate that Genes play a crucial role you cannot simply dismiss it until it has been proven 100%. Since Homosexuality does occur in nature its does mean it's a natural thing. Just as death, killing, etc are natural. Killing in nature is far different than in human society. When a bird kills a fish it does so out of necessity to survive, we humans have cruelty where we kill for pleasure. Should we humans accept homosexuality? If we argue that since we are the only rational beings (which is incorrect as animals like elephants are also very intelligent creatures) then lets be rational. Pointless killing harms a society so it is bad, discrimination against people via gender, race, and sexual preference does not benefit society either it simply causes divisions. 2. Over-population) My claim was not that homosexuality will prevent overpopulation entirely but it will help reduce the rate of population growth which will give us needed time to find solutions to problems we face with overpopulation for instance the need for better food systems. Much of our modern agriculture is dependant on fossil fuels for packaging, transport, harvesting, fertilizers.. not to mention the waste involved. As fossil fules are a finite resource we are setting ourselves up to fail. Over-population will be fallacious if we do not adapt current practices. My opponent seems to misunderstand the difference between the rate of growth and a decrease in population. True the Population growth rate is decreasing (people are having less children) but this measures the rate of population, not the population itself. Population is growing exponentially. While education and safe sex practices may have lead to a decreased rate of growth it isn't shrinking. Allowing gay marriages will not only help to further reduce the growth rate, but it will also allow people to live their lives to the fullest and thus allow them to contribute to society as discrimination will not be an issue. 3. Prevention of back-lash and Discrimination) Of course there will be backlash. One must only look at history to see that this will happen. People of color were discriminated against in America not to long ago and in some cases there is still the echoes of said backlash. Just because there is a possibility of a backlash by the discriminators does not mean we should not move forward. If we were too worried about backlash people of colour would be lower class citizens, women would still not have the right to vote, etc. Look at more modern criticisms of different religions. Islam has had more people criticize it in regards to free speech, there's backlash but its worth it when your pointing out a wrong. The Risk of a backlash should not warrant continued discriminations. Just because something is a threat to your world view does not mean you have to embrace it. Take Christianity Vs. Buddhism. If Christianity is right Buddhism is wrong and a threat to Christians, does this mean Buddhism should be outlawed? No. Christians simply have to learn how to interact with people that hold different ideals, this is a crucial part of growing up and maturing. Society needs to adapt as it has in the past and for all intensive purposes it will be better off.. or would my opponent like to explain why it was wrong to bring people of colour to equal status as whites? 4. Passing of gene or committing suicide) Remember even though gene theory has not been conclusively proven it is the most likely scenario based on the evidence collected. But even if Genes played no role and contrary to the evidence at hand homosexuality is simply a choice that both people and animals make, the unwarranted discrimination still instills false feelings of guilt in people. To merit this guilt homosexuality must be proven to be detrimental and harmful to people in a way that is noticeable difference than strait people and could not occur if they had been strait. While I do have assumptions in my statements my opponent does as well. The difference is mine actually use the information we have at hand in an honest way. I am also looking out for the well being of my fellow man who is being discriminated against for something's that is not wrong. Yes education and acceptance on gay marriage does indeed reduce the feelings of guilt and rates of suicide in homosexual populations as long as there is discrimination and inequality the problem is still there. Allowing gay marriage will further reduce inequality, and make it more socially acceptable. Since marriage status has been ""Revamped"" in the past I don't see an issue with doing it again. My argument is not that less suicide = less population growth, I'll assume my opponent misinterpreted my writing rather than deliberately twisted my words (I apologize if I was unclear) My argument is that allowing same sex marriage will A) improve the quality of the homosexuals lives B) Reduce the false notions of guilt and thus reducing the suicide rate. C) Lessen the current population growth rate D) give us much needed time and manpower to find sustainable alternatives to current practices. In no way does less suicide lead to a lower population growth rate these are separate issues. As Gay marriage would be acceptable gay men who are forcing themselves (or planning to) in strait relationships and bearing children will stop thus reducing the birth rate. 5) addressing the ""Counter-Plan"" A) Expand Civil Union Legislation to All States) A worthy and progressive step yes but it still does not address the inequality that homosexuals face as they are not allowed to wed. B) Allow Homosexual Adoptions) Good idea, further expand it by allowing married homosexual couples to adopt children. C) Allow tax exemptions for those who do adopt) Good idea This counter plan is a step in the right direction but it still needs to progress further to deal with the discrimination and inequalities that homosexuals face in today's society. While it is true that civil unions are more easily accepted than gay marriage the risk of backlash should not hinder the rights of homosexuals. Religion should not have the say on the lives of the non-religious. Why should an unbeliever have to submit to religious rules? I'm not saying that such rules are negative but that the traditional rules need not be followed by those not committed to the religion. Bottom-line: Societies that discriminate often face consequences; often the mistakes are due to short sightedness and the inability to recognize or deal with social, economic, and environmental issues. Often it is a combination of the three. I'd like to push forth the notion that one of the admirable traits of humanity, one that has helped our race advance is the desire for equality (A social aspect), the desire to have a world without discrimination. Society has moved forward and gotten passed the issues of race and gender. We still have a good ways to go before discrimination can be eradicated and Equality to reign. And although man has become less discriminatory there's still a long ways to go before we overcome that problem. My hope is that mankind can change rapidly. While we may or may not be there to see the eradication of discrimination, we can be the ones to stand firm, and seek out equality despite whatever personal convictions we or society may hold. We can be the generation that history recognizes as the one that further advanced human equality paving the way for our children, and our children's children, to move on towards the inevitable change it needs to survive. I have hope in our race, that we might seek justice, peace, and the well being of others and place it above our own desires to further advance our kind.

"My opponent's assertions are all unwarranted.Definitions and Clarification Since my opponent has failed to define what is humane and what is inhumane, I will define the terms [1]:Humane (adj)-1. Characterized by kindness, mercy, sympathy, etc.2. Marked or motivated by concern with the alleviation of suffering3. Inflicting as little pain as possibleWe will take inhumane to be the opposite:1. Cruel and not inflicting as little pain as possibleAlso, I will define baby (generously):Baby (n)- 1. A very young child; an infant.2. An unborn child; a fetus.Since my opponent has used the the phrase ""unborn baby"" the second definition will be used.Based on this definition, his statement that an embryo is the equivalent of a fetus in simply false. ""Fetus"" refers to a later stage of development [2]. The terms are not interchangeable.My opponent has not defined life either. I will define it as a property emerging at the cellular level, meaning that cells are considered life. It is also inaccurate to call it ""just for research."" This statement ignores the possible future applications of the research.My ArgumentNow for my argument, I will provide evidence that stem cell research is not inhumane but is, in fact, humane and therefore should be expanded. In order to fulfill my burden of proof in supporting the statement ""stem cell research should be expanded,"" I must simply provide satisfactory evidence that it is humane and has potential benefits.InhumaneWith the given definitions, we must ask the following question in order to determine if stem cell research is inhumane: Are the processes used to obtain stem cells cruel and do they cruelly inflict pain?Embryonic stem cells:""Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. Isolating the embryoblast or inner cell mass (ICM) results in destruction of the fertilized human embryo"" [2]. At this stage in development, the embryo is unable to feel pain, as it has not developed the necessary nerve structures [3]. Therefore it cannot be concluded that it is inhumane to ""take away another life"" in the case of embryos. I certainly don't think it can be said to be cruel. Unless he wants to argue that it is inhumane to, for example, remove and destroy a cancerous tumor simply because it is composed of living cells, I suggest that my concede on this point (well and on everything else too).Furthermore, stem cells need not be taken from embryos. Although research related to adult stem cells may be less promising, this fact alone is enough to render his argument invalid. Also, the methods used to obtain adult stem cells can hardly (meaning not at all) be considered cruel or inhumane.HumaneIn the future, stem cell research could very well lead to the development of treatments for Parkinson's disease as well as diabetes [4]. ""Regenerative medicine holds the promise of new ways to repair cardiovascular damage and of improved cancer treatment. Moreover, there are many other diseases and afflictions that stand to be positively impacted by stem cell research including: stroke, respiratory disease, diabetes (respectively 3, 4 and 7 on the CDC list of causes of death), neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries, and some birth defects. Potential benefits of stem cell research are numerous and range from development and testing of new drugs to cell-based therapies in which stem cells are used to replace ailing or destroyed tissue or cells. However, there are many technical hurdles between the promise of stem cells and the realization of these uses, which will only be overcome by continued intensive stem cell research"" [5].This perfectly fits with our definition of humane, as stem cell research is ""Marked or motivated by concern with the alleviation of suffering.""

Fox news states that anti-abortion groups oppose research on stem cells derived from aborted fetuses. They reject the argument that since abortion is already legal and women will have them, that stem cells should be used from aborted fetuses because they would otherwise go to waste. Opponents of research on embryonic cells, including many religious and anti-abortion groups contend that embryos are human beings with the same rights-and thus entitled to the same abuse as anyone else. They believe life starts at the moment of conception, when a sperm fertilizes an egg, since a distinct organism has come into being. Plus the destruction of an embryo is the destruction of a human life. According to explorestemcells.co.uk, since the advent of stem cell research, one barrier to furthering stem cell research has been religion. The destruction of an embryo that occurs when embryonic stem cells are extracted has angered them out, who see it as ""murder"" or the destruction of human life.

"Thank you for bringing up such an interesting debate here on debate.org Now, in your proposition you propose that you are pro in ""To do [stem cell research] or not to do [stem cell research]"", however, in your opening argument you state that ""grants and funding [are] blocked "" for stem cell research. You did not show anywhere in your opening argument that there have been any efforts to ban stem cell research privately, just ""federal[ly] funded stem cell research. You correlated stem cell research with federal funding, so I will focus my argument on 'federally funded stem cell research' as this is your main complaint. I do not deny that stem cell research can be beneficial, I do however deny the idea that it needs to be federally funded. The US Constitution was written by our founding fathers who supported a minimalist government. The founding fathers wrote the constitution to support a minimalist government. Nowhere in the constitution are 'stem cell research' or any federal grants listed. Because of this, the federal government has no authority to fund stem cell research. There are many reasons why we might not want the federal government being involved in research. The federal government is simply not needed- research can be provided by private groups, at the expense of those private groups rather than the taxpayers. Private groups are free from the many restrictions that are put place by government officials, including this sensitive issue- stem cell research. I agree that for some, stem cell research may seem beneficial- but for those who have religious objections to stem cell research- however incorrect they may be- to have to pay for a program that they are morally opposed to is wrong. The first amendment guarantees freedom of religion- however, those opposed to such programs are forced to pay for them, they are forced to pay for something that to them goes directly against their religion. If all research were to be private, individuals such as these would have no sway outside of the market. As of now, as it is their money going into the projects they do have the absolute right to complain- it would be a totally different story if it were privately funded.

I will be taking a scientific approach to this argument. First, let's establish a basic definition of what a disease is. A disease is ""a disordered or incorrectly functioning organ, part, structure, or system of the body resulting from the effect of genetic or developmental errors, infection, poisons, nutritional deficiency or imbalance, toxicity, or unfavorable environmental factors; illness; sickness; ailment (1)."" Many people suffer from incurable diseases all around the world today, but what if we could find a potential cure for these through stem cell research? I believe that stem cell research should be legal to practice on all stem cell types because it can provide us with valuable medical information, there are multiple different stem cell types that we can study, and because many excess embryos from in-vitro fertilization go unused or are wasted. --------------------------- Before I get into my main arguments, I will briefly address the three main arguments behind the opposition of stem cell research on all types of stem cells. The first main argument is that scientists are not certain stem cell research will provide us with many cures to incurable diseases. Just because we are not certain that it will provide us with cures, doesn't mean that we shouldn't try though. The next main argument is that it could create problems with overpopulation around the world. This argument is invalid, to a point, because the majority of the diseases that could be cured are not terminal. The last main argument against stem cell research involves ethics, and whether an embryo is life or not. According to an article in TIME magazine, ""an embryo used in stem-cell research (and fertility treatments) is three to five days past conception. It consists of a few dozen cells that together are too small to be seen without a microscope. It has no consciousness, no self-awareness, and no ability to feel love or pain (3)."" In a way, an embryo at this stage could be compared blueprints to a potential human life. ----------------------- First, I will be talking about the valuable information that stem cell research can provide us with. http://www.youth-restored.com... When looking at the diagram above, you can see that there is a lot of information that can come from stem cell research. The first thing it could provide us with is safer medications. Many new medications are tested for safety on rats. On occasions, medications may not affect a rat in negative ways, but it could cause a complications within a human. Testing on differentiated stem cells can provide us with safer medication testing because we can test these medications on human cells developed from stem cells. This could lead to the avoidance of having new medications that end up harming a human when it didn't harm a rat. ""Cultures of cancer cells are already used for screening cancer drugs, and growing embryonic stem cells into heart, liver or nerve cells could be useful for testing drugs that affect those organs (4)."" This shows that small amounts of stem cell research is beginning to improve our methods and effectiveness of medicinal treatments. The second thing it can provide us with is information on early development and stem cell differentiation. ""Studies of human embryonic stem cells will yield information about the complex events that occur during human development. A primary goal of this work is to identify how undifferentiated stem cells become the differentiated cells that form the tissues and organs (5)."" Studies on early development and stem cell differentiation can help us learn how to prevent birth defects and even potentially prevent cancer from developing (since cancer is when cells can""t stop dividing). The main thing that stem cells can provide us with is cell/tissue transplantation. According to an article by Guido de Wert in the Oxford University Press, stem cells can be stimulated to differentiate into any type of cell needed for a patient, then it can be transplanted into their body to repair damaged cells or to replace cells that have lost function. Diseases that can be potentially cured from this are: diabetes, Parkinson""s disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer""s, spinal cord injury, and many others (6). As you can see, a lot of the diseases that could potentially be cured are not terminal, but could enhance a person's life if treated. The last area on the diagram above is a blank box because, to put it simply, there is so much more than the things I have covered that stem cell research could provide us with that is still unknown today. ----------------------- Next, I will be talking about the different types of stem cells that are available and how successful they are. In the past ten years, scientists have been finding new ways to obtain stem cells for research. Until recently, scientists primarily worked with two kinds of stem cells from animals and humans: embryonic stem cells and somatic (adult) stem cells. In 2006, researchers made another breakthrough by identifying conditions that would allow some specialized adult cells to be ""reprogrammed"" genetically to assume a stem cell-like state (5). The chart below will show the effectiveness of the three types of stem cells: http://www.lifelineskincare.com... While we can study different stem cells that are not from a human embryo, this chart shows that human embryonic stem cells are the most effective in research. Human embryonic stem cells should still be used though because they are the most effective in research (like I stated before), and because scientists believe it is wise to continue research on all types of stem cells so that we can obtain the most accurate information. ----------------------- Lastly, I will talk about how many excess embryos from in-vitro fertilization go unused or are thawed. The main reason that people oppose the use of human embryonic stem cells (specifically) is because it could potentially render it incapable of growing into a human being. This is an understandable argument, but many excess embryos are wasted or killed either way. Instead of wasting these embryos, we could use them for stem cell research. When a couple has excess embryos from in-vitro fertilization (and they don't want anymore children), they have ultimately four options on what to do with them: 1.Donate them to another couple. Many couples don""t choose this because they cannot bear the idea of their biological children growing up in another family and out of their care. 2.Thaw them (discard). 3.Donate the for stem cell research. 4.Store them. Many couples end up storing the excess embryos indefinitely because they can""t decide on what to do with them, or because all other options are undesirable. In a survey of around 1,000 fertility patients who had excess embryos, 53% didn't want to donate them to another couple, 43% didn't want them to be discarded, and 66% actually wanted to donate them for stem cell research. The majority of these parents weren't allowed this option though because their clinic didn't allow it as an option (7). So because of this, many embryos end up getting frozen and stored indefinitely until they are unusable for anyone and have to be discarded. Also, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology went around to U.S. fertility clinics and counted that around half a million embryos (and counting) were being stored in 2002 (8). If this many embryos are being wasted, shouldn't we use them for a purpose through stem cell research? ----------------------- In order to take steps toward curing incurable diseases, we must continue stem cell research on all types of stem cells. Since there are half a million (and counting) unused embryos in storage, we should give them purpose by using them for research. If we could potentially restore a person's ability to walk, why shouldn't we take the measures to do so? Back to you, Con. ----------------------- (1)""Disease."" Def. 1. Dictionary.com.

52	Sa54e630c-A358ed4a8	1	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Stem Cell: TO research or Not TO research that is the question.	"the following is a outline for a paper i have to write. (High school) feel free to rebuttal gives me material and a GOOD debate! :) Although social conservatives of the United States resist an existence of a comprehensive plan for the development of stem cell research- rationales such as: treatment for terminal illnesses, regeneration of damage or lost organs, and the research and identification of alternative totipotent cells all to a mandatory, extensive development of stem cell research in the coming years. What is a Stem Cell? 1.Stem Cell is a generic term for a collection of cells called pluripotent cells. (pluri- meaning ""many"" in Latin, and Potent meaning ""powerful"".) 2.These ""stem cells"" can be classified by their ""ability"" transform into explicit functional cells (ie neurons, muscle cells, red blood cells). 3.A totipotent cell differentiates into any of the cells allocated in the body. 4.Mainstream media and the President of the United States labeled Stem Cells as ""Embryonic Stem Cell (totipotent)."" Which is a VERY slandering vindication on regenerative medicine. 5.There are many other ways to culture stem cells, for example in Deciuous teeth, umbilical cord blood, and the placenta. These Alternative methods are called Non-Embryonic Stem Cells. 6.Here is a flow chart-> Bush and others don't like Embryonic Stem Cell-> Bush & Media Use term Stem Cell too loosely-> grants and funding is blocked to Almost ALL federal funded stem cell research as a fallout because little is understood by the public even the POTUS; this is an effect of the loosely used term. Why do we oppose it? President George Walker Bush Speech given to the Press in 2001: ""…Stem cells raises profound ethical questions, because extracting the stem cell destroys the embryo, and thus destroys its potential for life."" Noted here that Mr. Bush blurs the line that distinguishes the differences between non-embryonic stem cell and embryonic stem cell. i.Oppositions of Stem Cell find their basis mainly upon personal religious believes. These personal believes should remain just that: personal. ii.Oppositions say that ""[they] believe human life is a sacred gift from our Creator."" Therefore a ""potential"" for human life should not be jeopardized by a ""hope"" that the further devolvement of Regenerative Medicine can indeed save lives. iii.Oppositions have successfully vetoed stem cell funding bills on numerous occasions; dispute a majority support for such a bill. a.Stem Cell Research Enchantment Act of 2005 i.The bill passed the House (HR810) by a vote of 238 to 194 on May 24, 2005 ii.The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 63 to 37 on July 18, 2006. b.Stem Cell Research Enchantment Act of 2007 i.The bill passed the Senate (S.5)on April 11, 2007 by a vote of 63-34 ii.The bill passed the House on June 7, 2007 by a vote of 247-176. iv.Oppositions usually define themselves as active white religious characters. Those whom object an expansion of stem cell research also demonstrate a parallel stance on anti-abortion laws; both subjects illustrate violations to a right to life -- as in accordance to the fundaments of Biblical teachings. v.Today we define these ""Oppositions"" as Social Conservatives or Compassionate Conservatives; they operate under a so called ""faith-based initiatives."" vi.Today Americans largely define the centerpiece of a compassionate conservative with a portrait of George W. Bush—a moron; sorry I can't help it. Good things that can come. 1)Use of a therapeutic stem cell treatment has been used in practice since the 1950's (believe or not!) 2)In the late 50's Dr. Edward Donnall Thomas of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center developed a surgical procedure in the field of hematology called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. 3)This pioneering modus operandi later presented Dr Thomas with a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. 4)Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, HSCT for short, is a widely practiced medical treatment in modern medicine (whether you are aware of it or not!) it is known as a treatment for 30 different congenital and acquired illnesses including: i)Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ii)Amyloidosis iii)Sickle Cell Disease iv)Aplastic Anemia 5)Sound familiar?

52	Sf10a0ef9-A30ad0225	2	2	Should stem cell research be expanded?	In Support of Embryonic Stem Cell Research	1. Actually, in my rebuttal, it is proven that currently adult stem cells have been used to cure and there are many clinical trials involving the use of them. Using blood cells from a fetal cord, despite the assertion, does not present the same moral or ethical dilemmas because it does not involve the destruction of human embryos. Also, these dilemmas are not confined to religion or political beliefs for this neglects bio-ethics all together. I would point out I addressed the supposed advantage and the limitation of adult stem cells while noting the limitation has been diminished by advances and new discoveries. My opponent failed to address the very serious problem of embryonic stem cells being proven repeatedly in experiments to be cancer forming while also being rejected by the body's immune system nor was the issue of actual cures and clinical trials, and there is only a single clinical trial. So far, embryonic stem cell research hasn't lived up to the hype or extraordinary claims made by supporters. 2. As for the destruction of embryos, also at stake is the dilemma of growing and destroying them to harvest them for cells to use in experiments. Like the pro-abortion defense, the argument always reverts to dehumanization, given that every single one of us underwent precisely the same stages of development. My opponent raises the objection that adult stem cells have the potential for DNA mutations, but this has been observed in embryonic stem cell experiments, which as my opponent mentioned, are capable of indefinite division and they build up mutations as they undergo these constant divisions. I have already pointed out my opponent neglects the high probability of them being cancerous as well as being reject by the immune system. At any rate, I reject the dichotomy and I'm not voting other than to offer my views based on what is currently known. 3. Those regulations and guidelines can just as easily be enforced without forcing taxpayers to subsidize research. It is quite damning that for all the hype about the miracle wonders possible with embryonic stem cell research, advocates demand corporate welfare to subsidize the research as opposed to voluntarily funding it it through donations. If President Obama can have $30,000 a plate fundraisers in Hollywood, why can't the same be done for embryonic stem cell research? Researchers are always reluctant to put up their own money when they can make a great living, compared to average American, and ask for a handout from the government. My opponent neglected to tackle the fact that our national debt is in excess of 100% of GDP, the massive unfunded liabilities of entitlements, huge annual budget deficits, or the fact our Government actually borrow $8 trillion annually. The problem of economic scarcity, unlimited needs and wants versus finite resources and capital, which means the government is pulling out our capital and consuming a greater and greater share of the resources. You also create an entrenched lobby that will make extravagant promises while producing nothing, which is where embryonic stem cell research is despite all the money. Politicians and bureaucrats are the worst people to make determinations, especially when you yourself say it is complex. The market is a superior force to the government; it only drives up cost, inefficiently spends, and ultimately wastes money at the expense of other research fields. I would close by thanking my opponent for the debate and urge caution given that it remains to be seen whether embryonic stem cell research will do any good and so far has done no good.

52	S604268b3-Ac9f40167	2	2	Should stem cell research be expanded?	That Stem Cell Research should be legal.	"Thanks, Con. I'll begin by dissecting my opponent's two premises: 1. Destroying the embryo is murder. A) I should point out that not all stem cell research deals with embryonic stem cells. In fact, there is ""adult"" stem cell research; these cells are more accurately called somatic stem cells, because they come from not only adults, but other sources. As such, no embryos or potential life are being destroyed in this regard, therefore this premise - at least in one sense - is entirely negated. B) Murder is defined as the killing of another human being under conditions specifically covered in law. Since the law permits abortion, then destroying an embryo is not committing murder. Legal abortion should mean legal stem cell research, logically speaking. C) On that note, any embryonic research is done on aborted fetuses. So, instead of ""wasting"" the potential human life, science has decided to gain from it and put that potential life to good use. Since the alternative to stem cell research on aborted fetuses is doing nothing with aborted fetuses, I'd argue that it's most beneficial and moral to try and gain potentially help others as a result of that research -- especially if the mother agrees to it. D) While life begins at conception, human beings don't have rights until they're born. As such, stem cell research is not violating the fetuses rights. I could go on, but let's take a look at Con's second argument. 2. There is no proof that stem cell research is useful. Bone marrow transplants have been performed for decades and involve the infusion of adult stem cells. Research based on embryonic and adult stem cells has yielded promising results for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and diabetes. Stem cell research also has generated new knowledge about basic cell mechanisms that is critical to understanding the causes of disease, such as cancer. While adult stem cells have been studied for decades, human embryonic stem cells were first isolated in 1998. There has not yet been time to develop new therapies using embryonic stem cells, though the overwhelming majority of stem cell scientists believe that to make the most rapid progress against disease, researchers must use all the weapons in their arsenal. That means using both embryonic and adult stem cells [1]. Moreover, neural cells in the brain and spinal cord that have been damaged can be replaced by stem cells. In the treatment of cancer, cells destroyed by radiation or chemotherapy can be replaced with new healthy stem cells that adapt to the affected area, which could be any given part of the human body. Dead cells of almost any kind, no matter the type of injury or disease, can be replaced with new healthy cells thanks to mind-boggling flexibility of stem cells [2]. Finally on this point, the phase 1 goals of human embryonic cell research has already been achieved. HEC have become an important vehicle for learning about tissue development and discovering the genes involved in self-renewal. Additionally, researchers have learned how to coax HEC cells to form many kinds of cells in the human body, including heart cells, motor neurons, and dopamine-producing brain cell amongst others. Plus, Con's only point in this regard was that 1/5 (which is a significant minority, by the way) died as a result of this research. Two things about that -- One, millions of animals are slaughtered for our enjoyment (food) each year; why is their death any less significant than the mice that die as a result of this? Two, Con has not supplied any research indicating any harm to (already born) human beings as a result of this research. -------------- Arguments for the Pro -------------- While adult stem cell research has been useful in the past, the reality is that HEC are more valuable to science. For instance, HEC's can develop into any cell type in the body, so they can form unlimited quantities of any cell type in the body thereby helping us understand inherited diseases, and allowing us to study human cells bearing the exact genetic defects that cause disease in patients. They will also allow us to discover safer and more effective drugs by making it easier to screen drug candidates. Research from stem cells can provide us with with information to offer new ideas for cures, treatment and prevention of things like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, stroke, heart disease, etc. Obviously this distinct understanding would provide significant social benefits for individuals, as well as economic gains for the society. While Con may argue that these economic gains are irrelevant, the fact remains that this research is conduced on aborted fetuses. Con's source says that those who value human life from the point of conception oppose embryonic stem cell research because the extraction of stem cells from this type of an embryo requires its destruction. In other words, it requires that a human life be killed, so they equate it to murder. Well first of all, I've already demonstrated how it's not technically murder, and second, the tiny blastocyst affected has no human features and more importantly no rights. Even if Con disagrees, the LEGAL aspect of this debate is to uphold the law. Since the embryo doesn't have rights, no laws are being violated and thus the research should remain legal.

52	Sf10a0ef9-A69738c6d	2	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	In Support of Embryonic Stem Cell Research	"Hello, and thank you for accepting my debate. To start this off, I believe that stem cell research should be supported by every nation in the world, regardless of opinion (1), because the potential social and economic benefits of the many that could be saved far outweigh the detriments of loss of life or limited funding. Social benefits of stem cell research: * the development of new treatments to cure people from various diseases * it increases the general quality of life, this leading to a healthier workforce * it would strengthen the position of each nation as a global asset, especially the US. Economic benefits associated with stem cell research: * it helps create more jobs in the research field * it has the potential to cure many diseases, which will get those afflicted back in the work force. * if stem cell research received more funding from the federal level, more labs around the country will be able to study stem cells and will need to hire new personnel for the new tasks and this would create more jobs in the research field. Stem cells are noted for having the potential to heal diseases and illnesses and save lives. For example, in leukemia patients, high-dose chemotherapy is the most effective currently established method to kill leukemic cells and can cure some patients. However, it also severely damages the remaining normal blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. To replace these cells, patients are given a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The cells for the transplant can be collected from the blood or bone marrow of a healthy donor. In fact, the transplant includes not only HSCs, but also important immune cells that help to kill leukemic cells. A patient""s own cells can sometimes be used for the transplant, if it is possible to collect enough healthy cells before the treatment is performed. If a different donor is needed, they must match the patient""s tissue type otherwise the transplanted donor cells will be attacked by the patient""s immune system and rejected. HSCTs are particularly effective for treating certain types of acute leukemia. However, the procedure is intensive and risky with the potential for substantial after effects. Therefore, this type of stem cell transplant is only considered when standard-dose chemotherapy fails to eradicate the disease. (2) For Parkinson's disease, it's been shown that embryonic stem cells (ES cells) could offer an alternative source of new cells for Parkinson""s patients, thus slowing down or even possibly reversing the effects of the disease. Methods such as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which enables the nucleus of adult cells to be reprogrammed to express the properties of embryonic stem cells, and harvesting blastocysts created by in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics. The opposition to such research involving both kinds of ES cells - those from blastocysts created by in vitro fertilization clinics and those derived through SCNT - is largely based on the belief that blastocysts should be treated as human beings because they have the potential to develop into a person. Those, like me, who disagree argue that personhood is not conferred until much later in the process - for example, after the blastocyst has become implanted in the uterine wall, or after pregnancy has developed to the stage at which the fetus has viability independent of the womb. (3) As far as type I diabetes, those with the disease are deficient in insulin and have high blood sugar levels because they lack insulin-producing beta cells. Therefore, if beta cells can be successfully produced from stem cells, they could be transplanted into diabetic patients as a treatment and potential cure. As the stem cells are made from the patient's own skin cells, they would all match the patient's DNA. (4) Studying stem cells will help us understand how they transform into the dazzling array of specialized cells that make us what we are. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are due to problems that occur somewhere in this process. A better understanding of normal cell development will allow us to understand and perhaps correct the errors that cause these medical conditions. (5)(6) In closing, I have pointed out how stem cell research has the possibility of positively impacting society. While I will admit that there are drawbacks and risks involved, I strongly believe in the phrase ""nothing ventured, nothing gained"" and we owe it to ourselves and future generations to at least support stem cell research. Once the position is taken that one is against stem cell research, then that means that one is not accepting of progress. Again, to my opponent, thanks for accepting this debate.

Gene theory is the most likely scenario based on the evidence at hand my opponent seems to think that because its not 100% proven he can take the answer that is least likely and backed not by evidence but by personal convictions.. This is not academically honest. While gene theory may not give benefits it would prove that homosexual tendencies are a natural phenomenon in which people have about as much choice as they do in deciding their eye colour, and yet people still discriminate My opponent assumes that I don't understand the difference between intelligence and rationality. A rational interpretation of the facts brings us to one stance ""gene theory is not proven but it is the most likely answer based on the evidence we have accumulated, while it is possible that homosexuality could be a choice there is no evidence to back it up, in fact the evidence we have suggests the opposite. Because of this choice is the less likely alternative."" Until further knowledge is gained we cannot claim choice is just as likely for that is dishonest and hold basis only in personal convictions. True I do not have a statistic to explain how much the growth rate in population would shrink if gay marriage was made legal, and quite frankly I wouldn't trust the statistic to be all that accurate based on the number of homosexuals in the closet. Common sense would lead to reason that if the false feelings of guilt and immorality were removed and discrimination was not a factor homosexuals would stop entering into heterosexual relationships in attempts to please society, family and hold to this false sense of morality (which as a side effect creates children). Since we will have homosexual couples the side effect of children will be eliminated. If we have people unhindered by discrimination improving the quality of their life they will be able to contribute more to society. As side effects the growth rate will shrink, and we will have more time and more manpower to deal with current issues (such as environment) My opponent claims to have proven a shrink in population. Fact: all the universities and peer-reviewed journals recognize a growing trend in the population. We are growing not shrinking. Right now the bulk of the world's resources is used by a minority of the population. In 1999 there was about 6 billion people on earth. Conservative estimates suggest we will have about 9 billion in the year 2050. This specific Stat was taken from William Nortons ""Human geography the 6th edition"". Addressing the issues in this system will help us to consume less. Getting rid of centralized agriculture would reduce copious amounts of waste. Backlash will be violent, but we can put laws in place and deal with those who break it to discourage violence. Historically this works, there is a cost and it takes time, but the end result is worth it. by putting more systems in check to help protect the rights of individuals we can prevent some of this violence. Look up your history about colored people in America. The issue of suicide will not be solved only by gay marriage but it needs the aspects of education to stop discrimination. It would be hypocritical to say we should stop discrimination yet still discriminate on the right to marry. Marriage will help stop discrimination because it will bring equality. To say that the Counter-plan solves all inequality is dishonest. It allows heterosexual couples to marry and not homosexual ones. This is a form of inequality. Yes my opponent is working on some of the inequality and to that he deserves some respect, however, he does not address it all. I am simply calling for him to elaborate on the CP and make it better by reducing even more inequality. Having the benefits of marriage is different than having marriage. Gay couples know this. Gay couples want the ability to marry if they choose thus having equal rights. Backlash can be dealt with by laws. Frankly if we do not address the discrimination that leads to backlash we are ignoring crucial parts of the issue. My opponents counter plan is respectable as it does attempt to reduce the amount of inequality that homosexuals face. The problem with it, is that it does not eliminate all of it. Gays still can't marry under it because of a threat of violence. This threat should not be tolerated. This threat needs to be addressed, confronted, and abolished, not appeased. There is violence against gay couples under civil unions as well. Why not get rid of the violence by creating harsh laws and consequences for those who are violent and those who discriminate. Allowing Gay marriage will reduce discrimination and benefit society. The possible positive outcomes outweigh the risks (which can be dealt with by implementing new laws to protect the rights of people). Gays should not be seen as second-class citizens. Its time to take a stand against discrimination. My opponent is on the right track but his solution has shortcomings that must be dealt with. If we are truly to get rid of discrimination we must give equal rights to homosexuals (including the ability to marry) and protect them from any form of violence that could occur in response. Marriage alone is not the answer but it is a part of it. Thank you for your time."	PRO	stem cell research expanded	stem cell research expand

52	S604268b3-Adf81257c	2	2	Should stem cell research be expanded?	That Stem Cell Research should be legal.	"1. Con begins his argument by asking why embryonic stem cells are used at all. I've already answered this in my R1 argument. Embryonic stem cells are more valuable, because they retain the ability to divide and make copies of themselves indefinitely. Adult stem cells are more limited and specialized than embryonic stem cells. They have the ability to make just one or two kinds of tissue, such as blood and immune system cells, brain or muscle cells. Adult stem cells also have a more limited capacity to replace themselves than do embryonic stem cells [1]. Additionally, in only five years between 2000 and 2004, adult stem cells used in some 25,000 bone marrow transplant treatments have been complicit in at least 3,629 American deaths, 624 of which involved children under the age of 18 [2]. 2. Regarding the rights of the unborn, only 36 states have a ban on partial birth abortions at the moment. That means that a lot of people disagree with your ideology that ""killing before it cannot be considered a good thing."" There are various philosophies that dictate moral values, and I'd rather not get into the abortion debate since this debate is about stem cell research. So moving on, you said, ""So if people are deciding to use fetuses that are aborted anyways for SCR, the abortion rate will rise. They will want more embryonic stem cells, and they will find ways to get people to have abortions and give the stem cells to them."" That is a completely fallacious and unsupported argument which cannot be accepted, because you have provided no reasoning or evidence to support it. If you can in R3, so be it. 3. Your next point was that embryos are being killed being killed despite there being no proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that embryonic stem cell research is helpful. First of all, this is a blatant lie considering that in R1 I've already explained how embryonic stem cell research has already been successful and helpful in its first phase. Second, these embryos aren't being killed despite anything; these embryos have already been set aside to be killed, and would be destroyed via abortion whether stem cell research was being utilized or not, so this is a moot point. 4. Next, you asked, ""If a stem cell is just a blank cell, then why is an adult stem cell any different from an embryonic stem cell?"" Answer: Adult stem cells are more limited and specialized than embryonic stem cells. They have the ability to make just one or two kinds of tissue, such as blood and immune system cells, brain or muscle cells. Adult stem cells also have a more limited capacity to replace themselves than do embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells could never be used in patients because the use of viruses to reprogram these adult cells predisposes the cells to cancer. As a result, these cells cannot replace the use of embryonic stem cells. There is widespread agreement among leading stem cell researchers, including the scientists that developed iPS cells, that research must continue on all types of stem cells including those derived from embryos [1]. 5. Con continues by claiming that a blastocyst should be considered a human being because it will ultimately develop into a human being. Well, a caterpillar will eventually develop into a butterfly, but until it does, it's still considered a caterpillar... because that's what it is - a caterpillar, not a butterfly. Nevertheless, this argument is completely useless because abortion is legal. If abortion is legal, then it is logically absurd for stem cell research to be illegal. Again, issues regarding morality, rights and values stem from philosophy. I am from the camp that believes an unconscious fetus (a fetus younger than about 20 weeks old) has no rights, and therefore embryonic research is morally permissible. You said, ""just because it [the fetus] isn't protected by law doesn't make it inhuman."" Whether I agree or disagree, this debate IS about the law and what should be legal. Something not protected by law has no legal rigts. 6. Finally, Con says that embryonic research may lead to human cloning or other scientific development that he considers immoral. This is a blatant example of the slippery slope fallacy, and as such cannot be held against me. Stem cell research - the topic of this debate - is not about ""growing people"" so it's irrelevant. Not only are the two unrelated with different procedures and purposes, but it would be abusive for me to have to defend something (cloning and the like) since it does not pertain to the resolution. As such, I'll extend all of my arguments from the previous round and send this debate back to my opponent. Good luck! [1] http://www.umich.edu... [2] http://www.wired.com..."

52	Sf10a0ef9-Abe787468	2	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	In Support of Embryonic Stem Cell Research	"You're welcome and I look forward to the debate. I would begin by stressing caution on embryonic stem cell research given that there is a significant moral and ethical dilemmas that bear consideration, there are further problematic implications in suggesting the taxpayer must subsidize this research, and despite extravagant claims of miracles cures, it has yet to yield any cures while obscuring more promising and proven results from adult stem cells or many other various types of research. 1 - Adult (Somatic) Stem Cell Cures & Treatments Patients need actual cures as opposed to false hope. Adult stem cells are used in treatment and clinical trials with respect to: brain cancer, ovarian cancer, skin cancer, testicular cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, breast cancer, and many other cancers. They are used to treat type 1 Juvenile diabetes, myasthenia, Crohn's disease, and several other auto-immune disorders.Other treatments and trials exist for chronic coronary artery disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, liver cirrhosis, and other diseases. It shows much more promise. 2 - Problems with Embryonic Stem Cell Research There are no cures and perhaps one clinical trial with respect to embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells have been demonstrated in multiple experiments that they are too carcinogenic for therapy or they form teratomas (monster tumors). The next problem involves the body's immune system attacking the foreign cells requiring potential patients of any such therapy derived from it to take dangerous immune suppressing drugs and the recent ""fix"" was researches genetically engineered the cells to produce immune suppressing molecules, but this makes them invisible to the immune system rendering the body unable to reject cancerous cells and the problem of infection. The ethical problems arise from the misconception that cells are derived from a ""fertilized egg,"" which is only one cell and this requires a human embryo and it's destruction to derive the necessary cells. Also, the data shows no stable, functioning islet cells from embryonic stems cells in animals. 3 - Ethical Alternatives Adult stem cells have the ability to differentiate into cell types from different germ layers and this is called stem cell plasiticty providing the ability to take on new functions, which demonstrates their potential to be pluripotent. Scientists are also working on Altered Nuclear Transfer to produce pluripotent stem cells without the creation and destruction of embryos. 4 - Politicization of Scientific Inquiry When politics enters the stage, we see how a reasonable line of scientific inquiry was transformed into public relations campaign that makes extraordinary promises without the science being anywhere close to it, politicans and organizations dedicated to abortion piggyback the issue due to the destruction of human embryos that would be necessary as a means of promoting abortion, and scientific research is better served by steering clear of politics, public opinion, lobbying, and the other corrupting influences it invites such as the patenting of embryonic stem cell lines with $70,000 to $200,000 licensing fees while the patent holders lobby for more government funding. 5 - Federal Funding & Supposed Economic Benefits There is absolutely no barrier in this country to donating and giving your money for the purpose of scientific research. You are free to earmark all the money you wish to funding the research of your choice. There are philanthropic sources of funding, investment vehicles, and private equity markets where funding for research can be found, especially if the purported medical miracle wonderland lived up to the hype. Government funding invites politicians to arbitrarily decide who the winners and losers are despite any actual results at the expense of other people's money and leads to the creation of entrenched lobbyists making wild promises no matter how far-fetched. It becomes wasteful and inefficiently spent. Government spending also removes money from the private sector limiting the capital available and having a harmful effect on economic growth. Economics has always dealt with the problem of scarcity of resources and when the government wastefully and inefficiently squanders those resources, there are fewer resources available elsewhere for more promising fields of research with actual results. 6 - Miscellaneous Issues My opponent, forgive me for pointing this out, but HSCT was an example of adult stem cell research. Also, my opponent as a resident of California ought to know that the state spends $3 billion a year on embryonic stem cell research despite bad fiscal problems. It should be noted also that the National Debt has exceeded 100% of GDP and we have a monumental debt problem in terms of the unfunded liabilities of entitlement programs compounded by the fact that the federal government runs huge budget deficits each year and the more money printed by the federal reserve to allow this spending increasingly drives up inflation and we risk the inflation of another economic bubble that will cause another economic catastrophe. We cannot ignore many other areas of scientific inquiry that could treat and/or cure diseases as we could develop with breakthroughs in nanotechnology. 7 - Conclusion I see embryonic stem cell research as a legitimate line of inquiry, but I see grossly exaggerated claims that if possible would be many decades away, the politicization of the issue for political ends, the denial of the actual treatments found with adult stem cells, and I do not see government funding as a benefit to either the research, the society at large, or the economy. I think people could easily support the research of their choice with their own checkbook or through social media efforts like the ice bucket challenge (even though you don't have to dump ice water on your head to give money). I'm not against research so much as I see clear alternatives and realize the future and medical research have a vast array of avenues to cures and this is only one inquiry."

52	Saa9b79d-A1fb0f0ba	1	2	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Stem Cell Research Should be Funded	INTRODUCTION Greetings – Well, like always, it’s great to be here and I am excited to debate this (which is probably why took that challenge? ;D) I wish my opponent good luck and four enjoyable rounds about this. REBUTTALS 1. Embryos are not concise therefore experimenting on them is not cruel. True is, that embryos have no nervous system of any kind, as the experiments are done with embryos and Zygotes, still, they all, at the end, get terminated. That scientists are not able to physically torture the embryos doesn’t mean, that they don’t kill them. Killing has nothing to do with awareness. To kill: (1.1) Get rid of or destroy completely, especially in large numbers [1] This definition giving by the oxford dictionaries pretty much describes what is done with the research subjects in stem cell research. Though we all kill organisms on a daily basis, just think about mould, snails and spiders, is it morally way less clear, if there should not be a line when it comes to killing within our own species. Society heavily builds on the assumption that is wrong, or better harmful for society, if we kill human organisms. Countries like the USA have grey zones that enables them to kill humans that have committed crimes against society (death sentence). Many other countries such as Germany or Finland don’t allow this logic. This means, that the killing of human organisms cannot generally be seen as something that society has only one answer to, which again means that using tax money for something society doesn’t agree on, is morally controversial itself. 2. Embryos are not as important as complex human life To start off, there is nothing wrong with a little respect. In fact, I hope especially those who actively engage in stem cell research have the respect to understand that they are working with human organisms. Even when they see it as morally justified we can expect them to have respect for life itself, because they create it and they end it. Also, stem cell research is not a miracle science nor is it of immediate success. Other than with abortion we don’t ensure ones survival with another ones death, but hundreds of embryonic stem cells are probably lost for wrong leads or ideas. Funding it now will not get your eight year old girl a cure tomorrow and nobody grants that these cures won’t come from non-embryonic research or iPS cells, which are both parallel forms of stem cell research that don’t involve Zygotes and Embryo disposal. It also controversial to link the worth of a human organism to it’s complexity, awareness, ability to feel pain. There are - born humans with no functioning nervous system - coma patients that aren’t known to be self-aware - mentally and physically disabled born humans and unborn ones - unborn foetus that are physically health, have a nervous system and are developing an awareness Ranking all these people on a scale from worthy to unworthy of life, easily gets us to points in history where human mistreat was justified with this logic. On a mathematical basis: how many embryos have to be used to save the lives of those who would die in the time we need more to find the same solution with iPS or non-embryonic research? If embryonic research would be our only option to save people in an infinite future; this would be different, but chances to find the answer in other ways are there. 3. Embryonic stem cells are the only option This is not fully true (and not referenced, just to be clear here). Since 2007 we are able to create human iPSCs (Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells) that are, though not perfectly yet, programmable back into an embryonic-like stage [2] where they can act and serve the same purpose of an embryonic cell created via fertilisation. The UCLA has already succeeded in making neurones out of skin cells, means that brain diseases are not only curable with traditional embryonic stem cell technology [2]. 4. It’s everyone’s own choice to approve or disapprove of the stem cell research. Well, that is actually my argument. Because funding is, unless by private sponsors, government funding. Means paid with tax money. If I don’t approve I am not able to withhold my money from being used for funding. Which means we should not fund it and respect the moral feelings of many citizens that regard stem cell research as murder. This debate doesn’t try to evaluate whether we should outlaw stem cell research, it evaluates whether we should fund it. And we should not, for the following reasons. ARGUMENTS Premise 1: Embryonic stem cell research is morally controversial Many religions regard it as murder, such as Christianity [3], Judaism and Islam. Though we don’t have to personally follow religious believes as scientists, funding is a different matter, because it involves tax money from many and many religious people. With a world wide population of about 31,5% Christians and about 24% Muslims [4], we already have a solid majority against stem cell research internationally. Stem cell funding would violate their ethics. The logic that we can’t just draw a line between a worthy human (healthy adult) and an unworthy human (disabled? Unborn? Coma?) means that we can’t say for sure that stem cell research is not murder All this makes embryonic stem cell research controversial already Premise 2: Embryonic stem cell research is not the only option we have As already pointed out do we have other options such as non-embryonic research and iPS. Non-embryonic research has more limits than embryonic research but has shown to be successful in many forms such as improving and/or treating the lives of those suffering from Parkinson and autoimmune diseases, stroke, corneal damage, blood and liver disease and diabetes [5]. iPS, though not fully functional, has the same potential [2] as traditional embryonic cell research while not involving the fertilisation of an egg cell. Premise 3: Funding would support potentially harmful actions Funding embryonic research will certainly increase the need for embryos. Therefore the need for female egg cells. Other than male sperm donation, the donation of female egg cells is more problematic and harmful for the donor. Starting with being just physically unpleasant (other than sperm donation) and ending with the risks for bleeding, infertility, cramps and allergic reactions to the antibiotics [6]. Funding will also increase the budget of the research facilities to pay egg donors better, encouraging young and/or poor woman to donate against their moral codex and their health concerns. It even might encourage fathers and husbands to put pressure on their wives to donate eggs because the market price for egg cells is already around $5,000 to $10,000 on some markets.

52	Sc27c8a7b-A608dd20b	2	2	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Embryonic Stem Cell Research Should be Expanded	My opponent says, “There is a comedic point raised that the crime rate would go down.” But the fact is, it isn’t comedic. Women who have unplanned pregnancies are more likely to become poor and have poorer children. Studies show that crime rates are higher among the poorer community. According to Jacksonfreepress.com, “Lower-class youth commit four times more violent crimes than middle-class youth. The total cost of crime in the U.S. is $2 trillion per year—$1.3 trillion comes from street crime and the remainder from economic crimes such as fraud. The victimization costs of street crime are approximately $700 billion per year. Poverty raises the cost of crime by at least $170 billion annually. Fifty-three percent of people in prison earned less than $10,000 per year before incarceration.” Studies also show that embryonic cells can indeed cure cancer. If we do more research, we can find cures for other diseases. According to Americansforcures.org, “Stem cells hold the promise of treatments and cures for more than 70 major diseases and conditions that affect millions of people, including diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's Disease (ALS), spinal cord injuries, blindness, and HIV/AIDS.” My opponent said that in the last round I merely explained it was a good line of research and didn’t need expansion. Healso says, “It already is covering transplants, therapy and many other factors of genetics and to expand it is unnecessary.” But my opponent ignores the fact that, as I mentioned above, there are at least 70 diseases that need to be cured. Stem cell research needs to expand because there is definitely a potential to cure those diseases. How can you say it won’t work or we don’t need to when we haven’t even tried? As I explained in my last postd in my argument above, embryonic stem cell research needs to expand because it can save lives!

52	Sf10a0ef9-A737b83b2	2	2	Should stem cell research be expanded?	In Support of Embryonic Stem Cell Research	"I thank my opponent for his response, however, there are three things in his argument that I'd like to address. 1 - In his rebuttal, it is mentioned that adult stem cells would show much more promise than embryonic stem cells. While I can appreciate this to an extent, it should also be known that the term ""adult stem cells"" is often used very broadly and may include fetal and cord blood stem cells (1), which I would think would be just as much of a moral and ethical dilemma for those that choose to look at it from an ideological and/or religious perspective. Also, adult stem cells are generally less flexible and versatile than embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells have a far greater differentiation potential than adult stem cells simply because embryonic stem cells can develop into almost every type of cell in the human body. Conversely, adult stem cells may only develop into a limited number of cell types, so their potential applications are not as great as embryonic stem cells. Newer studies do, however, suggest that adult stem cells may have greater plasticity than was originally thought, which means that they may be able to differentiate into a greater range of specialized cell types. At present, however, it would appear that embryonic stem cells still have the advantage in their ability to differentiate more readily than adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are capable of almost unlimited division, or proliferation, when placed in a culture whereas adult stem cells do not multiply so readily. Stem cell replacement therapies require large numbers of cells and the current difficulty in growing large numbers of adult cells means that their use for therapy at present is limited (4). * It's also been pointed out that HSCT was an example of adult stem cell research, which is a valid point and one that I accept. Since I've done further research regarding this method (2)(3), I will rule that point that I made as invalid. 2 - The next argument Con makes is for the ethics of the matter, in which I say it's irrelevant. Opponents of embryonic stem cell research compare the destruction of an embryo to an abortion. They believe that the embryo constitutes life because it has the potential to fully develop into a human being. Those against embryonic stem cell use believe that is it immoral and unethical to destroy one life to save another. By using stem cells and discarding the embryo, it is thought that human life is ultimately de-valued by this act and is paving a slippery slope for further scientific procedures that similarly de-value life. In particular, many religious groups who are adamantly pro-life have condemned embryonic stem cell research and all of its applications. Other arguments against embryonic stem cells cite the fact that adult stem cells are the ones currently being used in therapies and thus, there is no need to even venture into embryonic stem cell territory. I say that if the toss up is between adult stem cells, (which are more likely to have abnormalities from DNA mutations, which can occur due to any number of factors) and embryonic stem cells (whose ""youth"" means that they are less likely to carry mutations and they also regenerate much more quickly than adult stem cells), I'll take the latter, as it shows an overwhelmingly higher potential to treat disease (4). As a supporter of embryonic stem cell research, I believe that an embryo is not equivalent to human life because it is inside the womb. Embryonic stem cells are blank cells that have not yet been categorized or programmed by the body, and can be prompted to generate any of the 220 human cell types. Supporters also contend that the societal costs of many diseases and conditions, both in monetary and suffering aspects, means that the ethical concerns regarding embryonic stem cell usage are not sufficient to warrant discontinuation of this promising therapy. Another argument for embryonic stem cell research is that the embryos are leftover from in-vitro fertilization and would otherwise be destroyed, so they should instead be put to greater use. Even further down the line in development is the belief that those embryos from legal abortions, which have already been destroyed, would be better used to advance human health rather than simply discarded. 3 - Finally, the Con is against government funding for embryonic stem cell research. If stem cell research were federally funded, the government would have the ability to establish clear regulations and guidelines about the use of the money. Therefore, the government can more easily enforce ethical research practices. Gov can require that researchers comply to regulations in order to receive the funding and can monitor the practices. For example, the a government agency can ensure that all embryos are obtained with consent from in vitro fertilization clinics and that no embryos are sold for a profit. These practices are harder to monitor if money is gained from private funding and the government is not directly involved. In addition, with the plethora of often contradictory laws surrounding stem cell research, the government can eradicate the moral and legal gray area in which embryonic stem cell researchers are trapped. The laws for stem cell research are very confusing and vary greatly between states. For example, according to the American Center for Progress, """"until November 2008, when voters amended the state constitution, it was illegal in Michigan to derive embryonic stem cells because the state constitution banned the destruction of embryos for research. As a result, researchers at Michigan""s large and prestigious state universities had to import cells from out of state"" (5). Federal funding would streamline the legal aspect of embryonic stem cell research and help eliminate the unnecessary bureaucracy on both state and federal levels. Hopefully states with restrictions or bans on research would remove them when presented with the opportunity to receive financial support from the federal government (5). The science aspect of stem cells is already complex and difficult enough without the added nuisances created by the current laws. Promising researchers are reluctant to invest time and resources into studying stem cells if there is the possibility it could become illegal and they had to discontinue their work because it would involve wasted time and money. Federal funding gives researchers the money necessary to carry out tests while simultaneously creating an incentive to scientists to pursue the study of stem cells. Moreover, the researchers would have a sense of security knowing they are not actively breaking the law in the name of science. With this research we could save millions. If anything, however, I do think that we should have a budget on how much our government should be allowed to spend on these health care advancements. In closing, I have shown how embryonic stem cell research ultimately does more good than harm. As we can logically see the most obvious explanation is that embryonic stem cell research is a venture to be explored in earnest. I have shown and demonstrated this with factual evidence throughout this debate. Thank you for your time. (1) http://www.closerlookatstemcells.org... (2) http://en.wikipedia.org...

52	S37e9fe07-Aa8e11a88	0	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Marijuana is Disgusting and Ought to Not Be Legalized, For Various Reasons Other Than The One Stated	"I'm sorry for the unfortunate forfeit round; I've been busy and my immediate needs precede those of mine on this site. Anyhow, since you seem to agree with me that we're still arguing on whether this drug ought to be immediately legalized for recreational use, let us continue arguing this point, as you have mentioned that I did indeed adjust my viewpoint and now do not oppose the CURRENT policy of the two states in which the drug is legalized; indeed, all that I am opposed to presently is the FURTHER legalization of this drug. So, as I've mentioned, I'm opposed to immediate further legalization with my argument revolving around three points so far: 1. The smoke of marijuana contains harmful substances 2. Abuse of this drug entails many known health risks 3. Not enough quality studies have been conducted on potential or additional health risks I think I haven't mentioned this before, but, if legalized NATIONWIDE and then researched, the obvious risk is not only that it might have unknown health risks and many people's lives will be affected, but that also, if prohibition is attempted, it might become extremely problematic. You've already removed all restrictions and told people it's okay- do you really think they're going to listen when you tell them it's not? The damage will have been done, and the need to get high will preside over the need to obey authority. We humans spend a lot of time tending to our habits. Since you and I both are aware of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug that impairs the brain temporarily, let us consider the effects on the economy and social system if it is legalized. You maintain that alcohol is worse, and, counter-intuitively, legalized. And I don't disagree that alcohol is worse. All I'm saying is, alcohol, during the foundation of our country, was NOT made illegal. Not only that, alcohol has a had a place, in many forms, in all world cultures, and it is not only used as a drug- it seems to be mainly used as a beverage. I certainly don't believe in getting drunk- toward this subject I keep the same attitude as I do toward weed- but the simple fact is, alcohol has such a place in society, whether you think like me or not, you're never going to be able to make it illegal. It's a shame, really, that so many bright, intelligent people (or otherwise) but their time into making themselves stupid under the influence of alcohol. Tell me, do I sound like I'm advocating the defense of alcohol? I don't NEED to defend it; most people will wholeheartedly do so anyway. Sadly. What I'm saying is, why add to the problem? Why would someone- with more information about health risks or not- knowingly make something like this, something that hinders thinking, legal? When you legalize something like this on a national scale, the most likely scenario is that more and more people will use it more and more frequently. We've got alcohol, now we have another mind-numbing substance? Excuse me, isn't there a problem here? And as to what you said- that people ought to choose for themselves whether to cause bodily harm to themselves or not- are you aware that, under that pretense, you could argue for the legalization of any number of things, such as cocaine, PCP, LSD, Krokodil- I could go on and on. WE KNOW these things are harmful, and, if we encouraged people, through legalization, to encourage others to use these things, we'd be in quite a fix- unless you have some sort of counter- argument? You have to realize the effects of peer pressure. What's more, interestingly, drinking while under the influence of weed and alcohol increases risks twofold. Let's discuss some possible economic and social implications of recreational-use legalization. I'll use www.globaldrugpolicy.org for this purpose... ""Economists estimate that marijuana use will increase by 75% - 289% once legalized, or more if advertising is permitted."" You do realize what that means, right? It means that, once legalization goes through, between 13.05 million and 47.85 million new users will be created. As for school productivity and the welfare of teenagers- ""Marijuana can cause disinterest in activities, lower grades and isolation from the family. It can permanently impair brain development. Problem solving, concentration, motivation and memory are negatively affected. Teens who use marijuana are more likely to engage in delinquent and dangerous behavior and experience increased risk of schizophrenia and depression including being three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. (73)"". You mean to say, dear opponent, that you are willing to, in our already educationally-lacking country, you would put the welfare, education, and FUTURE of teens and other school-aged children at risk??? You do realize it decreases ambition for achievement, among other things??? You would risk the future of our nation, for we are indeed taking into account our future, on the pretense that legalization could possibly reduce crime rates??? ""Our drug treatment facilities are full of young people dealing with marijuana related problems. One study of children in treatment showed that, 48% were admitted for abuse or addiction to marijuana, while only 19.3 % for alcohol and 2.9 % for cocaine, 2.4 % for methamphetamine and 2.3 % for heroin (74)."" That's a MASSIVE statistic, 48 percent. But it only makes sense, seeing as how use is so common in these ""young people"". ""Marijuana use accounts for tens of thousands of marijuana related complaints at emergency rooms throughout the United States each year. Over 99,000 are young people (75). "" Yep, go ahead and multiply all these statistics with legalization and see what you get! ""As many as 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 20 (76)."" So yeah, go and argue that more high school students drive drunk than high, but first, ponder for a least a moment that statistic. ""In spite of legalization, crime is endemic and will not diminish even though the kinds of crimes committed might change. In fact, under a heavily regulated legalization regime, police detentions for marijuana-related offenses may dwarf the current rate."" ""Legalization will increase drugged driving and more drugged driving will mean more dead and injured drivers and other innocent victims and all the cost related to these tragedies (78). "" And, as to the argument that legalization will keep people out of prison... ""Under our current laws few offenders are in prison for marijuana possession. No more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of federal inmates are locked up for marijuana possession and, among state prisoners, only one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) are in for marijuana possession without a prior record (81)"" ""The proponents of legalization ignore the fact that legal sanctions deter or delay potential abusers, thereby limiting the growth of the illicit market. Law enforcement also leverages drug users/addicts into treatment through the use of drug courts that offer treatment as an alternative to incarceration."" But, of course, then you'll have more people attempting withdrawal being treated in centers, which means more of people's money down the drain. I beg your patience. I'm not done yet. ""According to a recent study by Colorado State University, Colorado""s legalization experiment will require retailers of marijuana to charge 318% more than producers (82). The same study also found that current estimates of legalization""s revenue potential are overblown by about 60% and that, in reality, legalization would raise revenue equal to only 1% of Colorado""s budget."" ""Ultimately, this will push users into the black market and drive retailers into the tax-evading ""grey market."" Law enforcement resources will need to be re-marshaled to address problems caused by marijuana-impaired driving, underage purchases, and criminals who seek to undercut licensed marijuana retailers."" So, not only is legalization grossly unfounded on scientific facts, more so founded on risk, and not as clear-cut as you deem it to be, it could also be seriously detrimental to work and production. ""Legalization will not only have devastating consequences for health, crime, and productivity, it is a waste of taxpayer dollars that could much more wisely be spent on more effective deficit-reducing measures. Likewise, if the public buys marijuana, this diverts funds from the national economy that are available for more productive purposes like education, research, and prevention. Even if tobacco use has so far been shown to cause more health harms than marijuana it does not follow that legalization is a justifiable policy shift in light of its harms."" I agree with this entirely- why cater to just another ultimately useless hobby that burns money and will only have the most awful effects on our national well-being? Sure, legalize it- and then see how many people call in sick (weed increases risks for various diseases) and pour their time and money into treatment AS WELL AS buying weed. Less productive students equals less productive workers, and thus a less productive economy. You really want to add to people's stress levels by giving them another addiction? To encourage them, with the argument that it's better than alcohol or tobacco, to add to their insecurity and and escape tendencies and have perhaps a third of the nation having to deal with withdrawal? Think realistically. 1. Known risks 2. Lack of conclusive studies 3. Lack of studies about medical benefits 4. Progressive economic harm 5. Inhibition of students' ability to learn Think about you're doing before you chant ""Legalization"". This drug will really hinder our attempts at better-educated workers, that's for sure. Why add to the problems we ALREADY have? Best of luck to you refuting my argument."	PRO	stem cell research expanded	stem cell research expand

"I'm sorry that Con evidently thinks this is a waste of time. It seems obvious to me that, since she accepted this, she would have a responsibility to take it seriously. Con seems to be unable to bold and italicize her round (perhaps she used a different browser?), but she posted it correctly on the forums, so here's a link: [http://debate.org...] Number 1. ""My point was that they CAN and DO. I have no idea how many times I have to repeat myself. I was the instigator of the debate. I was Pro. I was making a proactive argument that there are no good parenting qualities or techniques that are exculusive to heterosexuals or males and females, specifically. You apparently agree! You've never argued otherwise, and you failed to list a single trait proving that assertion wrong. However, instead of saying ""Yes it's true"" and conceding that as a contention in my favor, you continuously whine that I am ""straw manning"" you and that it's not your burden to provide an answer."" I have absolutely no idea what Con thinks she is arguing, or what point she is trying to respond to. You made a proactive argument that there were no specific characteristics that homosexuals could not have. I did not argue. You were right. I conceded this point. My entire accusation here was that she pretended this was essential to my case. That's what a strawman is- twisting your opponent's position into something it isn't and refuting that. My case never was that heterosexuals had specific characteristics that homosexuals could NOT possess. It is both a strawman and a semantic. This is what Con said: ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" My response: ""Technically they can, but I am saying that this is generally not the case. If you are saying that it is ""possible"" that gays can raise well adjusted children, I point out that it is also possible that beating kids is a good method for discipline (seeing as there must be at least a few success stories in the world)."" She said that homosexuals could have any characteristic that heterosexuals could possess. This is true. I conceded this, as you can see from the quote itself. My assertion that this was a semantic is obvious- she was arguing that homosexuals COULD have the parenting capabilities necessary to raise children effectively. What did this have to do with anything? I responded that I agreed with this and that ""it was generally not the case."" In other words, I was arguing that heterosexual couples generally had those characteristics- as I should have! She then responded to me: Her response: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Then: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person can not. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" What does the fact that ""good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents"" have to do with ANYTHING I was saying? You repeated yourself and did not respond to what I said. Rather, your claim that I ""dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant"" was basically saying that you had won this point. Who cares? It had nothing to do with my case. ""You completely fail to see that you can concede an argument(s), and that isn't the same as conceding the entire debate. You should have acknowledged the argument that I made was true, and moved on to explain why you felt it was irrelevant or not enough to win me the debate."" What does that have to do with ANYTHING? I did concede that there were no characteristics homosexuals could not possess, as you can see by reading my first round. You repeated yourself and demanded that I prove otherwise! ""You're being completely dishonest in saying I am ""strawmanning"" you when it was never your argument to begin with, as you rightfully point out. You don't even know the definition of straw man apparently yet you accuse me of using it."" This is what a strawman is: 1. Person 1 has position X. 2. Person 2 disregards certain key points of X and instead presents the superficially similar position Y. 3. Person 2 attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Let me put it more simply: I had the burden to prove that children were generally raised more effectively with a mother and a father than with two of each. It was not my contention that no homosexual couple possessed the characteristics that children needed to be raised well. I conceded this and pointed out why it was irrelevant. You repeated yourself and pretended that I needed to refute this. But it was not and never was my contention. You responded to a assertion I did not make and demanded that I prove homosexual couples could NEVER possess those characteristics even after I explained my position to you. You did not refute anything I said. You have strawmanned me and exploited the resolution. Con is using dishonest tactics RIGHT NOW. I said this in my previous round! Indeed, when addressing my question, she simply quoted it out of context and left out everything else. She has unlimited characters, so I don't see why she would even need to do that. That question (""What exactly did you hope to gain through this argument other than proving that homosexuals COULD have the characteristics to raise children properly?"") makes no sense without the rest of my accusation. Next round, Con needs to quote and respond to my argument in full rather than taking certain statements out of context. ""Drop this contention, for everybody's sake. You haven't proven a shred of dishonesty on my part, so it's not a legitimate contention in your favor."" We have two scenarios here: Con is either the stupidest, laziest, and most inattentive debater on this site, or she deliberately used dishonest tactics. Courts do not let people go because they can't read their minds and don't know for sure what they intended. They require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is what I have provided: REPETITION of blatant misinterpretations of my arguments even after I pointed them out. Danielle isn't stupid or insane. We have overwhelming evidence that she did, in fact, exploit the resolution and strawmanned me. May I remind the readers of this little gem?: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Yes, she directly lied about her position in Round 2 of this debate by saying that it was only about generalities. Number 2. ""We both agree that having two same-sex parents are better than one because two are simply better than one thanks to the additional benefits. Are you following? Good. Now, the article explained the benefits of having two parents - which MouthWash and I agree on - including dual income, additional support, more resources, etc. Still following? Awesome. So, much like contention 1, which explained that there are no particular traits exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality or males and females in particular, I was simply noting that all of the benefits of having an additional partner could be achieved by gay couples as well as straight couples! Get it?! Just as my point 1 my argument was that gays and males/females could be trustworthy, responsible, caring, etc. and have all the qualities of good parents (those traits are not gender or sexuality specific), I was acknowledging in point 2 that the additional benefits of having two parents could be equally applied to gay couples of either sexuality or gender as well. I simply cited the study to indicate what the benefits of two parents were, hence the word COUPLES in the resolution. I wanted you to again acknowledge that gays of either gender could provide the same additional support of a second parent. Again, we are talking about gay vs. straight couples."" Oh, so you were trying to establish that ANY two-parent family, regardless of sex, gives the same benefits of having two parents to their kids? But here's a problem: that's OBVIOUS. It has nothing to do with how homosexual couples stack up against heterosexual couples. These benefits that Con points out are inherent to two-parent families. Both types of couples obviously provide them. There was no reason to point this out. ""Re: As I have said, the study was not designed nor capable of finding discrepancies between how effectively same-sex couples parented in comparison to regular ones, or find (as Con said) certain characteristics that would more likely be emulated by traditional couples."" ""And as *I* have said, this is completely irrlevant."" I'm sorry, when did you say this beforehand? If you had, this might be justifiable as a misunderstanding. But you never explained this even after I argued my viewpoint. ""The study had absolutely nothing to do with comparing gay vs. straight couples. I never said that it was about that, so the fact that you keep repeating yourself as if you're somehow enlightening us to some discrepancy is just frankly embarrassing on your part. Again, THE STUDY IS NOT ABOUT COMPARING GAY VS. STRAIGHT COUPLES. Instead, the study was about finding specific qualities of couples in general (two parents) raising a child, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The entire point was to prove that like good parenting qualities, none of these qualities (like providing additional resources) were exclusive to one particular sex or sexuality either."" No, you're just making up a new excuse to justify your argument. I conceded that having a two-parent family was better than one, as anyone who reads the debate can clearly see. You responded to my concession by saying: ""No, it's relevant because two gay parents can raise children just as well as two staight parents. I've included a psychological study that confirmed this. Con seems to agree. The point goes to Pro."" There are two things very wrong here. 1. Your claim that it flatly proved that homosexual couples could raise children as well as heterosexual couples (i.e. the resolution). Looking at this by itself, it may have been simple inability to communicate your point, but the fact that you were directly responding to my EXPLANATION that it was not relevant to my case throws this defense into doubt. 2. The fact you said ""the point goes to Pro."" Yes, I did concede this, but the only context I've ever heard that kind of statement in are real, two-sided arguments where one person refutes the other person's position. In other words, you were pretending that you had won something through this, when in fact you had simply affirmed an obvious fact that I made clear I wasn't going to contest. Had you been honest you would have made it clear to me that you understood it was irrelevant to my case and stopped going on about it, especially after I explained my objections to you. You later said this: ""While 2 parents are better than one (Con agrees), it doesn""t matter if those parents are same-sex (Con disagrees)."" This is a lie. It doesn't matter if those parents are homosexual or heterosexual when it comes to benefits derived solely from having two parents. I said that that was obvious when I conceded it: ""Of course having a two-parent family is better than one. The economic benefits alone help children. Irrelevant."" ""I included a study validating that 2 same-sex parents provide the same benefits to parenting that 2 heterosexual parents do: double the resources, emotional support, etc. Con said this too was irrelevant, but it proves that what parentsprovide and not their sexuality is what matters."" Again, resources and emotional support are not the be-all and end-all of parenting. I've said this in my previous round, so why do I end up having to repeat myself? ""Re: In addition, I'd like the readers to note that she seems to have forgotten all about her previous point in which she demanded that I prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics and claims that traditional couples ""being more likely to emulate"" them was enough. This is enough to prove that it was deliberate rather than a simple misunderstanding. Hilariously, she also used this in the comments after the debate in order to convince people to vote for her: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" Absurd indeed."" ""Copy and paste whatever quotes of mine that you're referring to, and source them accordingly."" I did copy and paste your quote JUST NOW: ""He was arguing (but never proved) that there are parenting traits that ONLY a man or ONLY a woman can inherently possess, which of course is absurd."" It is from the comment section of our debate, as I JUST SAID. And this is from your R2 rebuttal to this very same point: ""or that a male/female dynamic would be more likely to emulate certain characteristics compared to gay couples."" ""What's your point here? You're cherry picking random sentences that I allegedly made about homosexualus NEVER having certain qualities."" I quoted the full sentence. It is actually located in the comments section five pages back in case anyone's interested. ""However, what I can say was that I never said you had to prove that homosexuals could NEVER have certain characteristics. What I challenged was to find even a single good parenting quality that was exclusive or inherent to heterosexuality - or - that gay people typically did not posess (or even less likely to posess). My point was that certain traits are not applicable to one specific sex or sexuality."" First of all, this shold have been in my first accusation, but Con decided to abandon the numbering, so I'll move on. Let's look at what was actually said, for starters. ""None of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals. There seem to be no qualifications of a good parent that a gay person can not possess."" This very clearly implies I needed to prove no gay person could possess those characteristics. I responded by saying this was a semantic. Danielle then replied to me: ""If Con thinks that there are qualities or attributes that a straight person can posess that make them a good parent that gay people can NOT possess, he needs to include what those specific traits are. Otherwise this point is in favor of Pro."" Here, she does claim that she was talking about characteristics of the sexes (implying her first statement was just another failure to communicate basic arguments). However, the readers can see that she was blatantly lying about her claim that she was only demanding a parenting characteristic that was simply inherent to heterosexuality (that gay people were less likely to possess). She directly said that she was talking about traits that gays CANNOT possess. Regardless of whatever spin she puts on it here, her own words convict her. Take a look at another response: ""There are no parenting traits a heterosexual can possess that a gay person cannot. Con wasted space saying I was exploiting the word ""can"" in the resolution (based on Mirza""s comments). My point is that any quality or trait you associate with good parenting - i.e., responsible, caring, loving, etc. - can be possessed by gay people. Ergo, good parenting qualities or techniques are not limited to heterosexual parents. Con never negated this idea; he dropped this contention and chose to whine about something irrelevant."" She has lied about her intentions, even after I explained to her again and again during the course of the debate that this was not about whether gays could possess these parenting skills. It simply can't be denied any longer at this point. The fact that this occured so many times in a row most definitely proves that this was a deliberate and dishonest tactic used to make my response more difficult and shove a completely incomprehensible burden onto me. ""Testosterone is part of the equation that makes guys more inclined to have ""rough and tumble"" play with their kids, which is a quality MouthWash suggested made having a male/female dynamic more superior. But a woman having more testosterone would incline her to engage in the same type of rough and tumble play that a child could enjoy with a man. As such, the child of a lesbian couple (for example) would probably not be missing out on any rough and tumble play that they would get from having a man in their life."" Con seems to be arguing the previous debate rather than if she used dishonest tactics in it. Regardless, she never brought this up during the debate and it has no bearing on this one. (Also, she would have had to prove testosterone was the be-all and end-all of parenting behavior, disregarding psychological factors to giving birth or being a father, or inherent behaviors programmed into the sexes, as we know homosexuals don't always act like the opposite sex. In addition, rough-and-tumble play isn't the only things males provide, as evidenced by this source: [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] which I provided in the actual debate). ""Throughout our debate, I challenged MouthWash to use either anecdotal evidence or scientific studies to provide me with examples of things that kids with gay parents said they were missing out on. He failed to do so."" Lie. I provided the rough-and-tumble analogy, I pointed out that a mother's close and soft behavior was critical for development, and I gave the above source, which you completely ignored. Let's keep this debate on track and argue only about whether you used dishonest tactics. Number 3. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""What I said: There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life... The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" ""First of all, it is absolutely Pro's burden to either negate or accept the contentions I provided in my favor. That isn't ""shifting the burden."" That is standard procedure in any debate. It's up to the audience to decide the merit of my contentions."" What the are you rambling about? What does this have to do with my accusation at all? I said that you were ""shifting the burden"" because you were acting like I needed to refute something that was irrelevant. She began with an anecdotal argument: ""My parents can throw a baseball and take me hiking just as well as any man could. I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" I responded: ""Anecdotal evidence only shows the limits of what is or can be possible. Pro concedes this later on and I'm baffled as to why she brought it up in the first place."" Her: ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" (Notice the word ""needed"" is another semantic. I try to point this out below). Me: ""Just because someone *can* turn out well adjusted, it does not follow that most will. You have reached a generalization based on insufficient evidence."" Her: ""The exact same comment can be applied to kids with heterosexual parents. They CAN turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" Con's responsibility was to explain why she used the anecdotal evidence. She claimed that it was to refute the notion that homosexuals could NEVER have characteristics allowing them to parent effectively (note that this essentially affirms my previous point about her using the characteristics argument to exploit the resolution). When I pointed this out... she pointed out in turn that children raised in a traditional family also had no guarantees of success. The problem was that this was obvious. Yes, my demand that she not use examples to prove that homosexuals *can* parent effectively applied to me as well. The problem is that this had absolutely nothing to do with MY accusation of her semantic use and that I never used the alleged semantics I was talking about. It's a completely unexpected and bizarre turnaround- one second I'm accusing her of lawyering, the next she goes and says that the same rules apply to me as well! And through it all, it ended up with her NEVER RESPONDING TO MY ACCUSATIONS. She clearly used smoke-and-mirror tactics to obfuscate the issue and this point is affirmed. ""Pro's responsibility is to explain why they are insufficient. The intention of my argument was PERFECTLY clear. Indeed, it was to highlight that two opposite sex parents were not needed for good parenting. Proving that is the entire purpose of this debate."" Well, this is awkward. Have fun proving that two opposite sex parents aren't needed for good parenting (it'll take about the viewing time of Zach Wahl's speech). My work here is done. As anyone can see above, I did respond sufficiently, only to be evaded by bizarre finger-pointing. ""- hence why I made not one, not two, but many arguments in my favor. Pro honestly thinks he can say ""These contentions don't matter"" and not have to argue against them. Quite clearly that's for the audience to decide. His job is to refute, negate, or diminish the relevance of my contentions - NOT whine that I am imposing a burden on him to argure against something he can't refute, and then name drop random fallacies."" I don't need to argue against your assertion that kids raised by traditional families ""can turn out fine, but there are no guarantees."" That's because nothing in my arguments had to do with that. It was completely random, inane, and pointless in context. ""Re: Again, she shoved the burden to prove that children NEEDED opposite-sex parents to have proper care. In other words, I now had to prove that they had characteristics that gay couples could never have."" ""Indeed, I said ""The real purpose of this point was to combat the notion that children needed two opposite-sex parental figures in order to gain certain benefits."" It's obvious that Pro is the only relying on semantics and manipulation given I've explained the purpose of my argument multiple times."" Um, you're basically digging your own grave now. Your justification for using anecdotal evidence is that children don't need opposite sex parents? Way to prove that I'm relying on semantics and manipulation. Obviously if some gay couple has those characteristics they'll raise children just as well as straights. The reason I'm explaining this time and time again each time she makes a ridiculous claim is because I fear she'll hold that claim up and say ""MouthWash never responded to this one!"" ""I won't repeat this again-- My point was that MouthWash completely, utterly, and 100% failed to provide a single reason or explanation as to why heterosexual parents were preferable or better at providing certain qualities. His ONLY answer in the debate was ""rough and tumble"" play by fathers had certain benefits, which I have already responded to both in this debate and the other many times over. It's clear that he simply failed to meet his burden, and the fact that I pointed that out repeatedly he is now considering ""dishonest"" based on my outlining of what I meant and what his burden was."" Rough and tumble play was most certainly not the only thing I used to argue, as I have previously explained. ""Re: Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers. As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction."" ""Pro has the audacity to say ""My claims had absolutely nothing to do and were not dependent on having the children be biologically related to the parents or sharing their DNA."" Yes! Pro actually said that in his last round! Of course, referencing a mother or a father absolutely and 100% had to do with shared biological ties and DNA."" That's another semantic use. Simply because the people involved evidently shared DNA does not mean that these were dependent on being related. Has Con never understood that correlation does not imply causation? Here's the source [http://www.civitas.org.uk...] As you can see, there was never any claim I used that was predicated on them being the biological parents. It is a strawman. ""It's quite obvious that anyone could talk soothingly to a baby; Pro's point was that a *mother* does it - or does it in a certain way - and my rebuttal was that it was not necessary for a mother to do it. Anyone could do it. Pro had to prove that kids with gay parents (I'm sorry... a same-sex couple as parents) are less likely to receive this kind of soothing attention, which of course he didn't."" ""The fact that he referenced a mother/father and then said that his claim had ""absolutely nothing to do with biology"" is a blatant lie - one of many."" Lie. My point was never that a biological mother needed to do it. Your rebuttal was not that it was not necessary for a biological mother to do it. Obviously when I pointed out that ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them,"" THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER SHE SHARED THEIR DNA. Pro is simply saying that I said ""mother"" so that must mean I was talking about a biological mother even though I EXCESSIVELY MADE CLEAR during the debate that my argument was not the biological ties or DNA were required. She ignored it all. Read: ""Again, you've avoided any real debate by strawmanning me. I have stated, very clearly, that it was an unhealthy relationship and the lack of a father or a mother that affected children. Sexual orientation in itself has nothing to do with it."" And: ""This has nothing to do with ""biological ties,"" but rather SS families vs traditional ones. This is the last time I will repeat myself."" My actual point was that fathers and mothers (not necessarily biological ones, for reasons obvious to anyone capable of making basic inferations) had different parenting traits and that children need those in order to have a healthy upbringing. Thus, homosexual couples could not parent effectively because they were the same sex. Here, let me quote everything I said so that Con doesn't take it all out of context: ""Moving on, your only response to my source about the effects of a natural (this does not imply being biologically related for reasons I'll explain later, and which should have been obvious to Con) father is one of your own sources. I grant that my source was obscure and undetailed, but I have demonstrated why your sources are unreliable, and thus my case still stands. I further point out that mothers and fathers relate to their children differently:"" ""Mothers tend to speak soothingly and softly in repetitive rhythms to their infants and snugly hold them. Fathers tend to provide more verbal and physical stimulation than mothers.As babies grow older, many come to prefer playing with their fathers who provide unpredictable, stimulating, and exciting interaction.[1.http://www.civitas.org.uk...] Recent evidence also shows that fathers differentially impact brain development. Without the father's spontaneous and energetic playing, the child's left hemisphere develops improperly [2.Schore & McIntosh, 2011]."" But let's move on. ""He also said, ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" My response to him was completely accurate and not at all dishonest. He referenced NATURAL, biological parenting in his arguments, and I dismantled them. Then he said his claims had ""nothing to do with biology."" Is this a joke?"" ""Natural father"" could be interpreted to mean simply that people without their natural fathers had one less parent to go with. Even if they had adopted parents, the effects of not having a father in their early years or possibly being in a foster home (as such scenarios are likely) would produce this effect. This seems to be a typical association-causation fallacy because I was obviously not saying that adopted parents couldn't care for their kids as well as biological parents, which would be ridiculous. How do we know that's what I meant? Because my source specifically said so: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]. She simply quoted me and left out my source entirely. Which is rather dishonest itself, isn't it? ""However other studies note that compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They also have higher self-esteem and confidence, and tend to break rules less, indicating that teen pregnancy is likely not in the cards... This debate is about one's sexual orientation affecting their ability to parent - not whether or not you can have the same biological ties to someone who is not related to you (obviously not). As such, I haven't seen any evidence that fathers and mothers aren't interchangeable insofar as being positive male/ female role models."" ""As you can see, there's nothing dishonest about my rebuttal or assessment of Pro's bad arguments."" No, not here. I JUST QUOTED what arguments I felt were dishonest, but it seems you decided to ignore me. So I'll do it again: ""Nowhere did he establish that biological ties to parents were significantly important. He presented a study that demonstrated the quality of care infants receive affecting their development. This source never said that the care had to come from biological parents. The same thing applies to Con""s other sources-- the study indicating the benefits of rough and tumble play never mentioned the importance of the father figure""s DNA. Instead it noted the benefits of the interaction, but did not discount the same benefits from similar interaction experienced by kids with two moms or two dads."" In other words, she dismissed my sources based on the fact that they didn't prove that DNA was important. A complete lie. Good luck defending this one. Number 4. ""Re: This argument is wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with each couples' parenting capabilities, and because unplanned pregnancies are not inevitable aspects of heterosexual relationships."" ""I said I dropped the point about unplanned pregnancies multiple times in the last debate, and explained that once again in this debate. The fact that he's bringing up a dropped contention (and I explained why I dropped it - in relevance to the contention that HE dropped) is bad conduct on his part. He's desperate. I advised him for my sake and the readers' sake to drop these blatantly dumb contentions that are not in his favor - especially those over dropped arguments which were therefore rendered completely irrelevant to the last debate. They weren't part of the judging process, so the fact that he's bringing them up when for all intents and purposes they were rendered meaningless is just sad and pathetic. He's wasting our time for no reason."" Yes, you dropped it during the debate becuase you said that it invalidated my own arguments about gays being depressed (which is wrong, but this isn't the time). My point was that you, rather than explain why you brought it up in the first placed, used smoke-and-mirror tactics by evading an explanation and dropped it by saying it hurt my own case (in which case you evidently fine with me being right). ""Re: I NEVER used anecdotal evidence to establish that homosexuals were depressed. Rather, I claimed that homosexual relationships themselves were unhealthy and led to depression and other emotional or mental problems... This means that they were inherently tied with homosexual relationships, in contrast to unplanned pregnancies which are entirely avoidable."" ""Saying homosexual relationships lead to depression is anecdotal, because clearly depression is not inherent to homosexuality. If that was Pro's argument, he should have made it. Clearly that's not true - not a single psychological association would ever validate such a broad, untrue assertion. I'm gay and I'm not depressed. I know tons of people in gay relationships who are not depressed."" No, I'm not exactly saying that it is inherent to homosexuality, but rather an inherent consequence to it. I still never used anecdotal evidence to establish that. By saying that no psychological association would ever agree with me is arguing directly against the statement, which we are NOT doing here. In addition, I did not drop this because of anything Con said, but because of the extreme difficulty in finding sources... as I have said again, and again... and again. I don't know why I have to repeat myself. Number 5. ""Re: What she was doing here was pretending that she had won something when she simply rehashed an irrelevant point over and over again. I said that this was a strawman. As for now, I have nothing to refute until my opponent actually addresses my accusation."" ""No. I'm not strawmanning Pro. Look at his hilarious explanation and see how he defeats his own argument. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills b) the fact that sex live don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. Pro blatantly srawmanned ME. If my argument was that a parent's sex lives have nothing to do with parenting skills, then Pro must ARGUE AGAINST THAT. He either has to concede it, negate it or undermine it's relevance. As you can see - by his own admission - he responded by saying kids need a mother and a father, and that homosexual relationships were unhealthy. What does a mother/father dynamic or gay relationships have to do with a parents' sex lives affecting their parenting skills?"" Con completely misrepresents my accusation and my actual response. Let me use the same syllogism with quotes. 1. [Danielle] claimed that sex lives had nothing to do with parenting skills. ""Con must explain how a parent's sexuality, either homo or hetero, has a specific impact on a child's behavior."" 2. [MouthWash] claimed that: a) kids needed a mother and a father b) homosexual relationships (not sex lives) were unhealthy (The above were just my argument for the debate.) 3. [Danielle] repeated herself and said that she had won the point. ""Con dropped this, so the point goes to Pro."" <-- Dishonesty. 4. [MouthWash] pointed out that she had won nothing because: a) I never claimed that sex lives affected parenting skills ""I can't understand why you think you've won anything here. My case has been about homosexual relationships (not necessarily who they have sex with) and the impact of not having a mother or a father."" b) the fact that sex lives don't affect parenting skills had no bearing on my case ""Irrelevant because I never even brought it up."" 5. Con repeated herself again and claimed that she had won the point. ""Whether a parent has sex with a man or woman doesn't affect their parental judgment. Con dropped this in R2, and in R3 responded that it's ""irrelevant."" Clearly it isn""t "" it proves that one's sexuality doesn""t impact their ability to parent effectively."" As you can see I never contested it and claimed that it was irrelevant. However, I was saying that it was never part of my case and by doing so, dismissed it. I shouldn't have had to concede it at all. Common sense should inform her that my arguments did not contest this assertion and so she should not pursue it, much less claim that the ""point"" had gone to her. ""I said I won the point because MouthWash failed to explain how a parent's sexual endeavors affect or harm their relationship with their child."" Yes, as if you could ""win"" something that was never at stake- the only context I've ever heard this in is when a debater refutes another debater directly, as I've said. My accusation is that you pretended to win a legitimate point rather than rehash an irrelevant one that I conceded. Please. ""Clearly, it was an argument for MY case, not his. I never strawmanned him, and his rampant accusations of random fallacies are dishonest on HIS part, not mine."" ""Strawman"" may not have been the precise term, but it is quite similar. After all, you did imply that it was part of MY case by saying you had won. Number 6. ""Re: Allow me to repeat myself- I was not arguing that a natural father was needed to parent effectively. I was arguing aginst opponent's contention that a lesbian's male friend taking her son out to the ball game somehow replaced a father. This is a strawman."" Let's see what I said: ""As you can see, this was entirely relevant to my case as it effectively argued against one of my opponent's contentions of the importance of a biological mother and father (or rather, inability for a non-biological parent to replicate similar benefits). Pro was absolutely responsible for providing evidence to back up his assertions of biological necessity or even staggering relevance, as my role in the debate was to specifically argue against that notion."" No, I was NOT arguing that biological ties were necessary at all (as I have pointed out). Con was essentially arguing that any male, such as a lesbian parent's friend or relative, could act as a role model and provide a male relationship on the same level as a father (not necessarily a biological one; the paternal instinct is learned rather than inherited). Let me quote her so she can't slip out of this one: ""I've always had a plethora of male role models. I never felt that I was missing anything by not having that dad for me."" Kids with gay parents aren't missing out on these things."" ""There are innumerable people raised by gay parents who turn out perfectly well adjusted, and note that they didn't miss out on any father/ mother figures in their life (implying that they had both male and female role models, which doesn't make any sense considering gay couples are the same-sex. Con was arguing that any male who helped with the kids could be a role model as well as a father)."" Here's another exchange. Me: ""Fathers are more dedicated to their children much more than anybody else"""" Her: ""Con never mentioned this before, let alone proved it. We have no reason to accept it as a legitimate fact."" Me: ""You take this out of context. I was responding to your argument that any arbitrary male role model could take the place of a father in a two-mother family. Same for two-father families."" ""MouthWash literally contradicts himself so blatantly that it's hard to tell if this is a troll debate or not. He said that he was arguing against the notion that a non-biological father (male friend) could somehow replace a father. I pointed out that I was arguing that biological ties were not necessary as Pro seems to indicate, and that they COULD replace a father. This is not a strawman in any way whatsoever. We are literally talking about the exact same thing. I was saying that biological ties were not important. Pro is saying that they are. There is absolutely not a single aspect of this contention that involves a strawman of any kind."" No, I was arguing against your assertion in R2 that a a child raised by lesbians could have the same benefits of a father from limited interaction with other males. I never argued that biological ties were necessary, and you are embarrassing yourself by continuing to strawman me. Number 7. ""Re: But as anyone can see, I provided examples of mental and emotional development from mothers and fathers which she then proceeded to strawman with her DNA argument."" ""I'm so glad MouthWash keeps arguing against himself; it makes my job that much easier. He said that he argued that child development patterns obtained from mothers and fathers was significant, and then said that I strawmanned him with my DNA argument. I've already provided the direct quotes proving that no such strawman exists. In talking about a mother and father, Pro is in fact referencing biological ties."" Already refuted this. ""But let's say he wasn't. Let's say he's talking simply about the various benefits offered by men and women. In that case, he's already defeated his own argument! If biological ties aren't important and only the gender dynamics are, then my point about random men or random women replacing male/female dynamics is completely true."" So you admit that you claimed that any random male could come and replace a father by simply interacting with the kids. An assertion which, as I have pointed out, is ridiculous. ""Further, here again is the direct quote where MouthWash references NATURAL a.k.a. biological fathers, meaning he's completely lying in saying that biology was irrleveant to his contentions/sources: ""The presence of the NATURAL father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls."" - MW"" The source I provided refutes this point. I must note it is amusing that you once again left it out in quoting me. Number 8. ""The debate started in round 2. Your format was terrible and didn't coincide with my numbering for cohesiveness starting with your very first rebuttal. If I missed something, it was an honest mistake and not an intentionally dishonest tactic. Good luck proving that I didn't respond intentionally, when in fact I addressed your points later on as well as explained how my initial rebuttal was sufficient regardless."" I don't need to ""prove"" your intention, it can be inferred by the fact it was so obvious. But that decision is ultimately up to the voters (here's a link to the debate): [http://debate.org...] You later responded only because I pointed out how ridiculous it was to claim you had ""won"" anything. And besides, it was never my argument so you should have had the sense to drop it rather than simply repeat yourself as you did. ""I'm not playing dumb. Pro just admitted that he lied about what fallacies I've allegedly used against him, but then blames me for not following his unstructured accusations."" I didn't lie; the only difference between the strawman and red herring is whether it was used to misrepresent someone's argument specifically or if it mislead in general, so it makes sense that I got confused. ""I didn't use a red herring, which is a vague accusation that only refers to intentional misleading from the actual issue. I didn't mislead against anything. My proactive argument was that kids with gay parents being teased was irrlevant to this debate. MouthWash said this was a strawman and dropped it. I pointed out that it was merely something I wanted to point out as part of my constructive case - NOT a manipulation of his arugment (because it was my argument) - and now he's accusing me of a red herring. I really don't know how to even respond to this. Clearly it's not. Clearly it's yet another example of Pro not understanding that he is responsible for responding to my contentions even if they are irrelevant to his own, or not part of his constructive case."" Yes, I do. I responded to it in the first round. What I claimed was dishonest about this in the first place was that you kept misleading people to believe that you had won a legitimate argument by repeating yourself. Let me ask you this: when you realized that nothing in my case remotely or even had to do with that, why didn't you let it go? Number 9. ""Re: What I meant by ""biological ties"" was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" ""This entire point is irrelevant to the debate as it highlights not a shred of dishonesty on my part. We're arguing over a dropped contention. This is a massive waste of time. He is saying that his initial argument was that homosexuality was entirely biological and hereditary."" Lie. It was that homosexuality WASN'T biological or hereditary. Let me quote myself: ""First, I will establish that sexual orientation is not hereditary and is subject to a large number of psychological variables. This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct. I point three facts that seem to contradict modern conception of attractiveness: 1. Apes tend to be attracted to older females due to their having more experience raising young and surviving. In modern society we observe the opposite. 2. People used to find overweight or heavier females attractive, the logic being that such women were better fed and had a larger chance of surviving. This is still prevalent in some societies. 3. In Elizabethian England pale skin (possibly signalling health because a clear and pale face probably didn""t have smallpox) and a large forehead was considered attractive (the hair was plucked to make the forehead appear bigger). Second, there is a large body of evidence that supports an ""exotic-becomes-erotic"" theory (which states that whatever sex is seen as ""exotic"" or different later becomes erotic, thus gender-nonconformity during childhood causes sexual attraction to the same-sex later in life). In a 1987 study, 75% of gender-nonconforming boys became bisexual or homosexual in later years compared with only 4% of gender-conforming boys. Homosexuals overwhelmingly report sex-atypical activities and had opposite-sex friends growing up. [1. http://dbem.ws...]"" Obvious, blatant lies aren't helping your case one bit. ""I pointed out that while it certainly had biological ties, it was not a mental disorder, but I never said that he accused it of being as such (thus, no strawman on my part). I mentioned that it wasn't a disorder before he ever even posted an argument; it was simply something to keep in mind as my argument was that being gay didn't inhibit people from good parenting despite being an inherent part of their identity."" It's good that you can concede this, instead of like last round where you openly denied you ever claimed this and I pointed it right out. ""For instance, wnope noted that schizophrenia was ""natural"" but could be harmful. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder. Homosexuality is not. As such, my point was that not being a mental disorder meant it couldn't be considered inherently harmful. There is nothing dishonest about this."" No, it was responding to Con's ridiculous point claiming that homosexuality couldn't be harmful because it was natural and found in animals. Wnope showed how ridiculous that was. Let me quote you in case she denies this: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality."" ""Re: I dropped the depression argument because I was unable to find many sources. And when did I say biology was not a significant factor? You are simply redefining ""biological"" to suit your needs. Throughout the debate you were never able to pick one definition of the word and stick with it."" ""WhatisthisIcanteven... I don't remember ever defining ""biological"" in any other way other than the actual definition of biological (as in, biological relationships established through a DNA connection). Anyway, Pro acknowledges that he dropped the argument. It's a moot point. There was nothing dishonest about my argument, rebuttal or explanation."" As I have proven from her quote, Con claimed that the fact that some animals were homosexual proved that it was ""natural"" (as if animals cannot develop social abnormalities) and that somehow proved it was harmless. Furthermore, Danielle has completely ignored my allegation that she strawmanned me. The strawman is as follows: Me: ""I was trying to establish that homosexuality was unhealthy and a product of emotional and social abnormalities. Again, I must quote: ""This is primarily to make the point that homosexuality is not ""natural"" in the sense that it is unavoidable or part of human instinct.""Your argument was literally ""homosexuality is not a disorder"" so I'm not really seeing anything pointless about it."" Her: ""Homosexuality is found in 1500+ animal species. They did not make the conscious choice to have a same-sex attraction given their extremely limited cognitive abilities. Con""s own source admits that sexuality is a byproduct of biology. There is nothing inherently harmful about homosexuality, and Con never proved that there is (he rightfully dropped the point about suicide)."" She was clearly strawmanning me by using the animals to demonstrate that homosexuality wasn't a conscious choice. I never said that it was and it was never part of my case. Number 10. ""Whether or not the conclusions were the result of fallacious reasoning is up for the audience to decide. There is absolutely nothing dishonest about what I said. Every single thing I said was true. I explained why his sources were irrlevant (didn't back up his claims); I explained how some of his sources helped establish my case in the debate (eg. Pro's Exotic Becomes Erotic article); it's true that he cited the same source 3x; and it's true that he failed to provide the correct sources for his claims which inhibited my ability to respond. As you can see, there was not a shred of dishonesty in anything I said in explaining why the Sources point should have been in my favor. This contention should be dropped immediately."" No, it shouldn't. It is true that I cited the same source 3x, and I explained precisely why I did that. It should never have been part of your argument as to why I should lose the Sources point. Number 11. ""Once again, let's examine what Pro is whining about. He's complaining that I brought up his ad hominem attacks against me in my explanation as for why I should win Conduct points. As I explained in the last round, apparently MouthWash doesn't understand that Sources and Conduct are factors of the judging process, which are each assigned a point value. As such, I mentioned his ad hom attacks as an indication that his conduct was inferior to mine. This is completely relevant to the debate, so I would say it's ""important"" and I didn't bring it up except for in 1 sentence during the final round. I didn't treat it as some very influential aspect of the debate; I merely pointed out that I exhibited better conduct than Pro, and I did. There is nothing ""absurd"" about this. There is nothing ""dishonest"" about this."" Yes, there is. An ad hominem is an argument made personally against an opponent [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. You're committed quite a few over the course of this debate, but making a GENERAL STATEMENT about the quality of your response is not anything remotely resembling an actual ad hominem, and you were incredibly dishonest for even implying that I should lose conduct for it. It would be like me claiming you should lose the S/G point because your fonts got messed up and made your round harder to read. It's beyond ridiculous and should conceded immediately. Number 12. ""I repeat: It includes zero explanation of specific harms of same-sex parenting (as in why the sexuality of one's parents leads to certain outcomes). Instead, it only provides a number for comparison with no factual data to support the conclusions."" It didn't need to. That wasn't the point of the study. It showed a direct correlation with inferior outcomes for children raised by gay parents, which contradicted your own studies. ""It also doesn't give any background information on the actual study (in terms of the demographics and other pertinent information, including class, geography, etc... This is relevant because how a culture reacts to gay couples raising a child will inevitably impact the way the child perceives themselves and their parents). It was Pro's duty to highlight a specific point within our debate, and then source it - not simply post a link to a source and say ""I urge you to read this."" First, the Sarantakos study was in Australia and Regnerus's was in the US (he also pointed out many specific flaws in the APA study including non-random samples and stuff like that. I also posted a link to it at the bottom of the page where it explain how the study was done, but it seems that now the articles are no longer free for the public. Other users who actually read it can confirm they were once). But the point is, Con is completely lying when she says that that information was not given. Second, Con completely misquotes me when she claims I only said ""I urge you to read this."" I actually said: ""I urge my opponent to take note of the Sarantakos (1996) study. It compares 58 children of heterosexual married parents, 58 children of heterosexual cohabiting couples, and 58 children living with homosexual couples that were all ""matched according to socially significant criteria (e.g., age, number of children, education, occupation, and socio-economic status)."" The combined sample size 174, which is the seventh-largest sample size in the research findings above. What's interesting is that all of the larger studies were all adult self-report studies, which means that the Sarantakos is the largest study that investigated the development of children."" Indeed, I explained to her exactly which study she needed to see! ""Right off the bat, I shouldn't have had to go looking at all of those external sources as they were presented, so they should have been disqualified from our debate anyhow."" I just caught you lying AGAIN. What's your excuse now? Forgot how to read? ""By his own admission, he messed up on posting his sources, and what I saw didn't seem to back up his case at all because of the error. I pointed that out, and it was not dishonest."" Le. I never said that I messed up anywhere. Con can't misquote me because I never said it. I shouldn't have to deal with this incessant insanity from a competent debater. ""At BEST you can say it was a mistake based on how he misused the Sources aspect of the debate. Of course, all Pro had to do was say ""Actually my sources did explain XYZ sufficiently, and here's why/how..."" I explained it in the debate itself: ""I posted three links to my three graphs, which happened to be on the same page and could be confused with each other. I posted the along with the corresponding numbers for each graph (4, 5, 6) so that readers would know what I wanted to cite. What's really sad is why anyone would consider that grounds for a point loss. It seems YOU got confused, because you apparently didn't bother to scroll down and see the different studies."" ""Of course then it would be up to the audience to decide. I didn't do anything intentionally ""dishonest."" A misunderstanding (even if I had misunderstood) is not dishonest. An accident is not dishonest. To me, Pro's sources were far from clear or cohesive and I'm not the only person who felt that way. Considering he didn't source properly or according to debate rules and standards, it's not my fault if myself or the audience got confused."" My sources were fine. What's so incredibly irritating about all of this is that I EXPLAINED THIS ALL IN MY PREVIOUS ROUND. All of it. I even had to requote myself multiple times. How is this NOT dishonesty? You've finished yourself.. ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please scroll up to the last part of my previous round to see the exact same arguments being made and then notice Con completely ignoring all of them. It's truly incomprehensible to me. ""I also still stand by the fact that he hasn't explained why his sources or studies are superior."" I can't even fathom a response to this. I directly gave you a link with multiple studies done by the APA and I pointed out the Sarantakos study and explained why it was superior. I even gave you a ScienceDirect link with more details. Anyone who even read it knows this is ridiculous. Here it is, so that nobody just has to take my word for it: [http://www.debate.org...]. (I pointed out Sarantakos during the actual debate). Finishing up. Let me summarize the contents of this debate: Con directly lied about several things she said that exploited the resolution. Con justified her strawmen by saying that my arguments required biological ties with the parents, an allegation disproven from simply looking at my source. Con has not denied that she repeated unrelated arguments and instead has claimed that I needed to concede them directly, which of course is ridiculous. Common sense tells you that you don't repeat completely unecessary things claiming you won them. Con has barely touched arguments 8, 9, 10, and 11, and instead used rather large amounts of text in ranting and mocking them. Con utterly ignored every single one of my arguments for 12- ignored them- and simply made accustions that they were hard to understand, a claim which cannot be upheld under the most basic scrutiny. I also predict Con will protest the massive length of this round. Let me point out that easily 60-70% of this has been quoted material. Unlike my opponent, who cherry picks what she wants to quote and address, I have quoted almost every allegation made and responded to everything in detail. In my opinion, she can address this round without much difficulty, especially because she doesn't have to do any sort of research ot cite links as well. Furthermore, I have combined her long, reptitive rants in the comments and found that the characters used in them alone totals over 20,000 (only a few thousand less than her previous round). Length should not be an excuse here. I request that the voter give lengthy RFDs that address specific contentions brought up here. Any RFD that just says, ""Well, I think so-and-so was better because of some broad reason"" should be treated as a votebomb. Analyzing the previous debate. Looking back at the actual debate [http://debate.org...] it is time to examine where all of these dishonest tactics came into play. 1. If in fact, the semantics are to taken into consideration, we need to look at their impact. Notice how the posts devolved into long, drawn out slogs as I directly quoted and responded to each of her arguments. I directly quoted her each time and gave her full context so that she couldn't misunderstand my points. However she often misquoted me and saved herself room by not sufficiently responding. Indeed, she has not remotely contested my accusation of Gish Galloping. It isn't a stretch at all- more than half of each round was dedicated to individually quoting, addressing and debunking specific stawmen and semantics which I have addressed in this debate. How much time was spent on her ridiculous repetition of irrelevant points alone? I already passed the limit simply in addressing what I could, but Danielle said that I needed to ""directly concede them."" Imagine if all of these semantics and strawmen- the things that Con demands I failed to address properly- were gone. What would be left? 2. During the argument, there were real arguments made and exchanged. Things such as a. Potential depression in homosexuals. b. Fathers and mothers relate to children differently. c. Studies showing homosexual couples' kids are disadvantaged. Notice that, throughout the debate, every SINGLE attempt to argue one of these points resulted in strawmen or some other type of avoidance tactic. a. Con used the reasoning against her unplanned pregnancy argument to claim that this was invalid. Obviously that is false; I never used anecdotal evidence to establish this argument. It is a strawman. b. Con completely failed to address this and instead took one of my statements out of context to imply I needed to prove biological ties were essential to parenting. Thus, she reasoned, the fact that fathers and mother have different parenting traits meant nothing for same-sex couples. Indeed, she dismissed it entirely by simply pointing out that the source never said care had to come from biological parents. It is a strawman. c. Con completely ignored these even after I explained them throughly and ignored the source I gave that provided more details. Throughout this debate, she has falsely claimed I conceded I messed up on them (I didn't) and blatantly ignored EVERY explanation, even long, drawn out ones that explicitly detailed how they were made obvious to you from the beginning. These are smoke-and-mirror tactics. It seems that for every actual argument I made, at every turn, I was repeatedly strawmanned into stagnation and forced to explain in detail what these contentions were. I repeated myself endlessly and got nowhere. She turned the debate into a fiasco by refusing to argue properly against even the most basic assertions I made. Arguments: It seems that all I had to do here was provide convincing evidence that some of the arguments used were dishonest, but the entire debate was utterly overloaded with them. Blatant falsehoods and strawmen from Con assured me a win. Conduct: Con regularly ranted, insulted, and condenscended, in the debate and on the comments, and even accusing someone of being my multi-account for simply supporting me (the admin proved he wasn't). It seems she simply didn't care about conduct at all here. Sources: Irrelevant to this debate. S/G: Both me and Con's spelling and grammar have been adequate. I thank the readers for their attention. I also thank Danielle for this interesting opportunity to debate, in the hope that she has gained something from it."	PRO	stem cell research expanded	stem cell research expand
52	Sc27c8a7b-Ad6bccea5	0	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Embryonic Stem Cell Research Should be Expanded	"My opponent completely ignores my last two posts. He says, “My opponent has argued that abortion is a good idea not that stem cell embryonic stem cell research should be expanded.” However, in my last post, I clearly said, “Embryonic stem cell research needs to expand because it can save more lives!” My opponent also states, “This is extremely irrelevant to debate and as much as the child could be a criminal, they could equally be the next Shakespeare or Mozart.” Two things are wrong with this claim. (1)This is very relevant to the debate, considering that it is a minor way that, once again, lives can be saved because of the drop in crime. (2) My opponent says they could equally be the next Shakespeare or Mozart without any solid proof or statistic. I do agree there is a small chance they could be great like this, however, statistics show that there is more of a chance that they will be criminals if they are poor rather than the middle and upper class. I have yet to see something that actually proves this wrong. My opponent says, “Stem Cell Research is fine as it is and is at an adequate level. It needn't be expanded.” False. If stem cell research expands, we can keep finding cures to even more diseases. And besides, is being ""adequate"" really enough? If we can take that extra step, we can go beyond being simply ""adequate."" It would be well worth the time.“Abortion is a separate debate topic altogether.” Also false. Abortion and embryonic stem cell research go hand in hand, considering that you need an abortion for that type of research. In fact, the controversial part of embryonic research is the fact that a baby needs to be aborted in order for it to happen.My opponent refutes my arguments even after I have proven them wrong, and lacks a clear, strong base argument.

First, to offer definitions: Stem cell research: The research of stem cells, as detailed here: http://en.wikipedia.org... Legal: ""conforming to or permitted by law or established rules"" http://www.merriam-webster.com... Note: As my opponent's case seems to be against stem cell research, the best interpretation of the resolution seems to be, ""Stem cell research should not be legal."" ""you could say that the people who reserch stem cells are trying to play god."" Well, if God gives us the power to manipulate stem cells for science, it's probably another tool given to us to advance ourselves. ""there are two parts of stem cells .one embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells,but today im going to focus on embryonic stem cells."" Well, I'm going to focus on placental stem cells [1]. My opponent's case is largely against stem cell research as a result of abortion. I agree that abortion should be illegal; however, this still leaves placental stem cell research, which should not be illegal. My opponent argues that government should not fund stem cell research. I agree. He then argues that small corporations do not have enough money to fund stem cell research. However, if nobody's ever going to have enough money to fund stem cell research, then what's the point in making it illegal? That just makes the law books a little bit thicker, killing a few more trees in the process. Let's save paper and not bother illegalizing stem cell research. Let private corporations research placental stem cells if they can get the money. In conclusion, illegalizing abortion will result in placental stem cell research, which there is absolutely no point in making illegal. Good luck. 1. http://stemcellumbilicalcordblood.com..."

52	S1a3171f3-A8ba629e9	2	2	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Stem Cell Research is Moral and should be legal	"Stem cell research (of all kinds) is morally acceptable, as it certainly should be. Stem cell research has opened countless doors in the medical fields. The nucleus of a stem cell is undifferentiated, meaning its chromatin has not coded for any specific job within an organism. It has not yet committed to a specific cell type, such as muscle, bone, or nerve cells. Within a zygote, the cells are totipotent. These cells can grow and develop into hundreds of other cell types, it is from these cells the rest of the cells in the body are developed through fission and mitosis. Embryonic stem cells are perhaps the ""holy grail"" of stem cells. This being said, the embryo is fertilized in a lab, with no uterine host. The egg is acquired from a consenting adult female, who knows what stem cell research entails, and that is what the embryo is used for, developing new lines of stem cells. In the case of the ""abortion"" argument, if you believe that an embryo, nothing but a clump of cells, with no personality, reason, or will, is a human, then you claim a human is nothing but a clump of cells. If you believe the embryo to be a person, just as you or I, then in preventing an embryo from being terminated, despite the potential for medicine and treatment, then you value the life of one being, (mind the voters, I do not believe the embryo to be a human) over the lives of millions of other beings, suffering from ailments and disorders that have the very real potential to be cured from stem cell research. Stem cell research has the potential to ""offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat diseases including macular degeneration, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis"". (http://stemcells.nih.gov...) However, Con shows her lack of knowledge on the topic in assuming that embryonic stem cells are the only stem cells there are. This is not the case. While embryonic stem cells have the most potential, and are the most versatile, other stem cells, such as umbilical stem cells are used in research. In fact, the male testes contain stem cells which produce sperm through meiosis. Stem cells found in an adult however, are much more limited in their potential to differentiate, as they are often limited to the different cell types of the tissue of their origin. Because these cells are totipotent/pluripotent, they can be used in many medical research projects. Therapeutic cloning has the potential to cure hundreds of genetic disorders. Using stem cells to clone a specific persons kidney (for example) could eliminate immunosuppressants and anti-rejection drugs, thus revolutionizing organ transplants. That being just one possibility, the amount of people that could be saved and cured through stem cells. Long term effects of stem cell therapy are little to none. If a doctor were to take an adult""s stem cell, and then grow a kidney (using donor stem cells specific to the recipient) the marker proteins of the organ""s cells will be recognized as the body""s own, and should have no side effects specific to the transplant, other than basic surgical side effects. Cons argument that it may not be effective to all ailments is another important point, as no one thing in medicine will ever be able to treat or cure all disorders, ailments, or diseases. Stem cells however, may be as close as medicine can get to this goal."	PRO	stem cell research expanded	stem cell research expand
52	Sf2508129-A16069d0a	1	0	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Cloning	"Imagine a person with a severe injury. Like maybe they are paralyzed with a severe back or neck injury. Or maybe someone who has lost a limb. Or possibly in the not so distant future, you could have an exact copy of yourself. Stem cells and cloning may be able to fix those things. Stem cells are a type of cell found in the embryonic. They are an almost base cell. Because later on pregnancy they begin to turn into all the cells the body will use (e.g. brain, muscle, heart, skin, bone etc.). But they turn into anything that they are near. So if you place stem cells combined with certain chemicals and DNA next to someone's brain it could repair brain damage. This is caused by the stem cells cloning themselves into the cells around them. This type of cloning is called therapeutic, it is used to help animals, and hopefully at one point people too. There is another type of cloning that literally allows us to make an exact copy of creatures through birth. It has only been tested on animals and is still very basic and in the early stages. There are still some obstacles to get over but if we push through with some hard work and dedication we will be sure to have cloning become something very well possible. There are obviously going to be some complications. One complication that we have is that the cells we are taking we are trying to make them feel like they are brand new, and although we can make them think they are new, they don""t always act like it. This means that some cells may die much earlier than normal causing the animal or creature to die earlier too. We are working on this issue and seem to be progressing very well. But in my opinion stem cell research and cloning should push on because I see in the future that this will become very useful. And may even save thousands of lives and make even more lives better."

52	Sc27c8a7b-A82679116	1	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Embryonic Stem Cell Research Should be Expanded	"As you may or may not know, stem cells can copy themselves and develop into the body's different types of cells. However, there's a reason many think embryonic stem cells could be more useful than adult ones. Adult stem cells are multipotent; in other words, they can only turn into cells of that specific cell type. Meanwhile, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning they can turn into ANY of the body's cell types. As you can see this would definitely be more flexible than adult stem cells.But what about abortion itself? Embryonic stem cell research could not expand without abortion. Many talk about how abortion takes away life, but ignore some key facts: The risk of a woman's death is lower in a modern abortion procedure than if she gives birth. Her chance of dying in an abortion is less than one in 100,000. The risk of a woman's death if she gives birth is 13.3 in 100,000. Abortion can lower crime. Criminals are often raised poor. Women who have unintended pregnancies also end up with their children being raised poor. According to Procon.org, ""Some estimates claim that legalized abortion accounted for as much as 50% of the drop in murder, property crime, and violent crime between 1973 and 2001."" Less criminals and murderers in the world would mean more lives saved. Stem cell research already saves lives and is being used to treat diseases like leukemia. It could also help us find cures for over 70 major diseases and save millions of lives. So why abort an ""innocent human being?"" (And the embryo isn't really that innocent, considering that it is most likely going to become a criminal.) Think of the facts. If we could continue stem cell research, for every abortion, we would save another life. If this occurs, it will create something of an equlibrium; no lives added, no lives taken away. But in addition, we would save more women's lives because they are less likely to die in an abortion. And finally, the lives of innocent civilians would be saved because the crime rate would go down. So, if we continue abortion and stem cell research, we would in fact be saving MORE lives than if we abolished abortion. If you look at it this way, there would be less life with ""pro-life.""

52	Sde54988c-Afa8c0cb5	1	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Embryonic stem cell research and the Constitution are in conflict with Roe versus Wade	"== Overview == As I said before, Pro has the BoP in this debate. Because the resolution is an ""and"" statement not an ""or"" statement, Pro had to prove that *both* embryonic stem cell research *and) the Constitution are in conflict with Roe v. Wade. If he fails to prove either, he loses. Pro has failed on both counts. (1) Embryonic stem cell research Let's look at the literal wording of the resolution here. Pro has to prove that ""[e]mbryonic stem cell research . . . is in conflict with Roe v. Wade."" So he already loses. Roe v. Wade permits abortion. Nothing in Roe v. Wade prohibits embryonic stem cell research. Vote Con due to this poor resolution drafting. I think Con meant that stem cell research is in conflict with *the Constitution,* not Roe v. Wade. But that's not what the resolution says. Vote Con right there. Nothing in Roe v. Wade conflicts with embryonic stem cell research. In addition, Pro fails to prove that embryonic stem cell research is unconstitutional. Pro's case against stem cell research in Round 2 can be broken down into two arguments: (a) human cloning is impermissible and (b) a fetus is a potential life and is therefore a ""person,"" deserving of protection under the Constitution. We can dispense with (a) really easily: the resolution does not deal with human cloning. Just because a clone could be made from the DNA in stem cells (or from the DNA in any human cell) does not mean that it is topical. Cloning is not the same as stem cell research. As to (b), Pro also loses because he bases personhood on *potentiality,* but he drops my analysis from Round 1 that the eggs donated for stem cell research *never* had the *potential* to be a human life. If stem cell research were outlawed, those embryos would just sit in a freezer somewhere -- unused. Unlike a natural pregnancy, when those eggs are fertilized in the laboratory, there is no mother to carry them to term. The eggs and resultant fetus never have the potential to be a human life. And if they aren't used for research, they won't be used at all. They're not going to become people. We can draw a clear line in the sand here between a natural pregnancy, which maybe has potentiality, and a fetus created in the lab for research, which clearly does not. By dropping this argument, Pro concedes that fetuses created for stem cell research lack potentiality and are therefore not ""persons"" under the Constitution, *even under Pro's definition of personhood.* Lastly, Pro in essence concedes my argument that utilitarian analysis is part of constitutional interpretation as applied in Mathews v. Eldridge and Lawrence v. Texas. Pro's only attempt at a response falls flat. Pro first cites the dissent in Carhart, which you'll notice is composed of the *liberals* on the Court. The dissenting justices in Carhart thought that late-term (post-viability) abortions should be protected by the Constitution. This position hardly supports Pro. Pro also cites the majority's reasoning in Carhart, which is that women -- by failing to terminate their pregnancy pre-viability -- consent to the state's intervention post-viability. Pro then takes that logic *too far* by arguing that women who have *sex* consent to the state's intervention into their private lives to ban abortion *entirely* because (as Pro puts it) ""women [must] take responsibility for their intimacy."" This reasoning was expressly rejected in Lawrence v. Texas in which the Court held that sex is an intimate relationship in which the state has *no business* meddling. I don't think anyone truly believes that by having sex with someone they are ceding their autonomy to the state, so that the state can turn them into a forced incubator for nine months. Under Pro's reasoning, if a stem cell researcher who was a woman violated Pro's proposed law and fertilized an egg in the laboratory, she is responsible for creating a life and the state should be able to forcibly implant the fetus into her and force her to carry it to term. The only difference between this and natural sex is whether the egg starts out inside or outside the woman. But ultimately, the violation of bodily autonomy is similar. The only difference is our reaction to the latter would be more visceral. Lastly, and *most importantly,* what does any of this talk about consent have to do with *utilitarianism.* Remember what Pro is supposed to be answering here: that constitutional analysis includes utilitarian analysis and that banning stem cell research has no benefits (no additional fetuses become people) but has serious harms (we cannot cure Parkinson's, diabetes, and paraplegia). Pro doesn't actually respond to this argument. He merely raises an off-topic argument about consent to state intervention. Utilitarianism is about the *efficacy* of government action, and if government action cannot achieve any benefit and can only be harmful, it is said to be irrational and unconstitutional (see Lawrence). For this reason, Pro has dropped my util argument and loses on the stem cell issue alone. (2) The Constitution is in conflict with Roe v. Wade Pro cites a lot of different passages. Let's dispense quickly with some of them. First, the Declaration of Independence is not part of the Constitution. Second, the Preamble is an ""introduction"" to the Constitution and is not a binding part of it. Third, the Ninth Amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as having no binding legal effect, and more importantly, it does contain the word *person,* despite Pro's claims to the contrary. The Amendment says, ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."" Pro misses the fact that ""people"" is the plural form of ""person."" But Pro misses the point by citing to all these other amendments and the Preamble. Roe v. Wade concerned the Fourteenth Amendment, which states (in relevant part), ""nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" Ultimately, Pro concedes the key reasoning in Roe v. Wade that in terms of the *legal* definition of ""person"" in the Fourteenth Amendment, personhood starts when you are born. How do we know this? Because the Fourteenth Amendment specifically says it in a different provision -- in the provision about birthright citizenship. Personhood and citizenship both start at birth. So the definition of ""any person"" in the Fourteenth Amendment means people who have been *born.* Pro may have a different *non-legal* definition of personhood that hinges on potentiality, but in the field of law, words are often used in a technical legal sense and have to be interpreted in context. The Fourteenth Amendment is quite clear that its protections extend only to people that have been born. Think for a second how absurd it would be if a fetus were considered a ""person"" in the *legal* sense. It would mean that a father could sue for custody of the fetus and insist that it be ripped from its mother and implanted in a woman of his choosing. If instead we conceive of the fetus -- for legal purposes -- as being part of the mother's body, such a ridiculous custody dispute could not arise. Pro makes a lot of *lay* appeals about what personhood *ought* to mean, but fails to prove that personhood actually means ""potential to become a person"" in the legal sense it is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. By failing this BoP, Pro fails to show that the Supreme Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment incorrectly in Roe v. Wade. Furthermore, Pro drops my analysis from last round that potentiality is not enough to inhere a ""right to life."" As I stated before, ending a life is cruel if the life is self-aware or can feel pain. Pre-viability fetuses are neither self-aware nor feel pain. Their potentiality to be a human under the right conditions is also not met (e.g. they don't have a willing and consenting mother to carry them to term). In addition, potentiality is absurd. Pro is arguing that even a laboratory stem cell fetus is a potential human life, but the conditions needed for it to become a human life are so ridiculous. You need to find a woman who is willing to have the fetus implanted and carry it to term, and if the lab happened to create 10,000 fetuses for research, it would be hard to find willing women for all of them. If you consider that to be ""potentiality"" then you should also consider an unfertilized egg or a sperm to have the same potential. The conditions needed to produce life are also unlikely, but perhaps the Constitution should allow the state to *force* us to procreate because wasted sperm and eggs are wasted human ""potential."" Conclusion: ""potentiality"" is an absurd definition of personhood, particularly when you're using it as a legal definition, rather than a lay one. In addition, Pro in essence concedes my argument that Roe cannot be in conflict with the Constitution by definition because the Supreme Court gets to decide what the Constitution says. Pro's only response is to the Justice Jackson quote. He misunderstands the quote as saying the Court is infallible and then points out the Court has reversed itself. However, the quote actually says that the Supreme Court is *not* infallible; it's decisions are just *treated* as such because it's word is *final.* Notice that Pro is saying that the Supreme Court reversed itself. Not the President. Not Congress. Not the People. The Court reversed itself. Because the Court has the final say on the Constitution. It can change its mind. But that doesn't mean that Pro's separate interpretation of the Constitution has any constitutional validity. And the Court has never reversed itself on whether fetuses are ""persons."" So Pro loses by default because the Constitution says what the Supreme Court says it does. Lastly, Pro drops my util analysis here too. Banning abortion would not reduce the abortion rate, so it would be wholly irrational to do so. The Constitution does not permit wholly irrational government action (see Lawrence). So the Constitution cannot be in conflict with Roe v. Wade. For all these reasons, Vote Con."	CON	stem cell research expanded	stem cell research expand

Do you feel comfortable allowing scientists to take away the possibility of life from an egg? I should hope not. In addition, cloning could take away a sense of individuality, since a clone is the genetically identical twin to the person who provided the genetic material, no matter the age of either person.

Contention 1: Planned Parenthood is a key contributor to biomedical research PP is a uniqe and difficult to replace contributer to medical researchers. They donate a large supply of stem cells which is hard to obtain for the researchers. Planned Parenthood provides this in bulk. So you may be asking, why is this so important. Well stem cell research is an innovative new phenominon with absolutely amazing potential. 1. Stem cell research offers the possibility for cure of absolutely horrible chronic diseases, many of which are incurble. We live in a world where people can just be just minding their own bussiness and then are given a death sentence. But, this isn't because they commited a crime and were given the death penalty. They are sentenced to death not by law enforcment, but by nature. Whether it be cancer, or ALS the rest is the same for millions. Death. Now I will quote author Mark Stern as he captures the torture of the disease known as ALS. ""For five years, I watched my best friend die of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terrible disease that causes one’s muscles to waste away. First he struggled to walk, then to speak, then to breathe. One tube pushed air into his lungs; another pushed nutrients into his stomach. Toward the end, he could only move his eyes. ALS does not affect the brain; through it all, he remained perfectly aware of his slow-motion torture. After years of suffering, he died of respiratory failure, his body skeletal and ravaged, his mind alert to his suffocation until the last moments of life."" It is societies ethical obligation to create a world with minimal disease as possible. There are countless of us who have lost loved ones to diseases. Those of us know best that pain their loved ones and the pain the person themselves have to go through. I am one of those people. At age 6 my my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Thankfully she was one of the lucky survivors. However, my grandfather was not so lucky. Earlier this year he died of pancreatic cancer. A type of cancer that is practically a death sentence to be diagnosed with. We should look at these losses and give these people a legacy of us creating a world where people don't have to die like this. Is it right for people to die for doing nothing wrong? More so, is it right for us to do nothing about it?Now to continue on the article ""Stem cells hold terrific promise for the treatment—and, eventually, the defeat—of ALS."" Now I will remind you this is a disease that has been known for years and because of the complexity has seen litle to no progress in fighting the disease. Stem cells offer the possibility for progress that has not been achieved in decades for ALS.Diseases like ALS aren't the only diseases that stem cell research can possibly cure, treat, or help us understand. Understanding the process of cell division and epigenetics in stell cells yield the potential for revoltionary treatment and cures for cancer. Stem cells also hold the potential for treatment of cardivascular disease which is a leading cause of death in the world.It is our moral duty to create a disease free world and stem cell research is a critical step towards reaching that goal. Planned Parenthood is a huge contributor to this step. Cuting funding would be detrimental to the advancment of public health and medicine.2. Stem cell research is absolutely amazing for the economyStem cell research is the epitome of innovation and advancment in economics. This research will revolutionize the economy. Let me give a few reasons why stem cell research is great for the economy. A. New markets. There is a projected regenerative medicine market of 500 billion. That's huge. This would be a great addition to the economy that would help spur medicine growth as well as help hospitals and clinics.B. Jobs. New researches and pharmacists will be needed for this research. In an economy with such a high unemployment rate this is precisly what we need.C. Stem cell research helps eradicate diseases and sicknesses that are a huge ecpnomic burdon on society. Let's start small, ALS. ALS costs the US $256-$433 million yearly. Because it's a rare disease this isn't huge, but every bit of spending hurts. Now let's move onto cancer. In 2010 cancer cost the us 124.6 billion. In 2020 it is projected to reach 158 billion. We must continue funding PP in order to help lower these costs by contributing to stem cell research.Contention 2: STDs and teen pregnancyTeen pregnancy is a serious issue in America and STDs. Among developed countries we have the highest rate of teen pregnancy. If you read this report here: http://www.plannedparenthood.org...... You will see the many ways that Planned Parenthood tackles this issue. It 1. Provides comprehensive sex education that teaches abstinence as well as sexual health information like condoms and other contraceptives. Comprehensive sex education has been proven to reduce STI infections as well unwanted pregnancy. If you read the report it also talks about how it is empirically proven that ""Increased Use of Contraception Accounts for 86 Percent of the Recent Decline inTeenage Pregnancy"" So by providing teens with contraceptives we only help reduce rates of teen pregnancy, and that's exactly what Planned Parenthood does.Also ""Easy Access to Contraception Helps Reduce the Incidence and Cost of Teen Pregnancy"" So again that's exactly what Planned Parenthood does. They also offer confidentiality which is proven to attract teens to their services, therefore reducing teen pregnancy.Planned Parenthood should be kept publicly funded because they use the methods that are scientifically proven to work best, that is the best way to tackle the issue of teen pregnancy and the spread of horrible and preventable diseases. They do best, because they understand how teens think and do their absolute best to work with them. Many other programs do not do this, such as abstinence only sex education which has been shown to make the problem worse. Planned Parenthood should be kept because they are the solution we need. If we cut funding to them, I promise you the problem will get worse.STDs take a huge drain on society. Gonnorea, Syphillis, and clamydia costs the U.S. 15.6 billion every year. Lately the prevelence of some stds have increased. A happen to young, low income, poorly eductated minorities. In a time with increasing STD rates sex education and cheap, accessible, resources to teens are key to reverse this trend. HIV is predicted to cost the US 30.7 billion next year.Teen pregnancy in the U.S. costs the government 9.4 billion in 2010. While teen pregnancy is declining it is still a huge issue. In fact, researchers have concluded that the reason teen pregnancy is on the decline is because of increased contraceptive use. Increasing availability to the most efficient way to contraceptives is the way to go in this situation. A test in Saint Lois showed this.A total of 8000 women were given access to free contraceptives. IUDs, the pill, condoms, everything. What were the results?""Teen pregnancies - 80 percent of which are unintended - plummetted. They stood at 6.3 per 1,000 teens in the study group, compared to 34 per 1,000 teens nationally.""When women were offered free contraceptives those women's teen pregnancy rate is 18.5% of the national average. That's less than 5 times the national average rate.For those of you who are against abortion you should fully support a plan like this. Under these women abortion rates were 44% of the national average. That's less than half of the regular abortions.Free/cheap and easily accessible contraceptives is part of Planned Parenthood's mission. In other words, Planned Parenthood is a huge part of the solution to the problem of STDs and Teen pregnancy.Now to conclude this contention I'm going to talk more about just how bad teen pregnancy is.1. Teen pregnancy is detrimental to education. The parents are much less likely to A. Learn anything in school while they have the kid. You stress the kids and distract them from what they should be doing at their age, learning.B. Make the parents much more likely to drop out of highschool before finishing.C. Most importantly you harm the child. They are far less likely to be sucessful in a school due to living in a household with a likely financially and emotionally instable family. They are more likely to cause trouble in class making teachers and students much less likely to help the child suceed in school.Education is one of the best options to advance society. In order to foster societies development eliminating teen pregnancy is key.2. Teen pregnancy increases crime, draining societies resources.A. The parents are more likely to escape through their lives with drugs. B. The parents are more likely to go to extreme, criminal methods to get money for their family.C. The child grows up more likely to turn to gangs, drugs and a life of crime. They are likely in search of familial acceptance, escape from reality or trying to provide for their families.3. The children are more likely to grow up in broken homes resulting in single motherhoodA. Children growing up in fatherless homes are 4 times as likely to live in poverty.B. The children are much more likely to be dependent on alcohol or drugs.C. The children are much more likely to fall to a life of crime.D. The daughters are more likely to become teenage mothers and the sons are more likely to impregnate a teenager creating a full cycle.4. The Children with teenage parents are more likely to become teanage mothers or impregnate a teenager.5. The children are much more likely to be dependent on social programs like welfare or food stamps.A. This drains societies economic resources.B. Under these programs you are less likely to have a job, so you aren't contributing to the economy."	CON	stem cell research expanded	stem cell research expand

Science is a major threat to human existence	"I would first like to thank Wylted for accepting this debate, and confirm her understandings on the definition.1) Science is slowly moving into area's where it should be restricted by morality. Cloning of animals and especially humans, as well genetic engineering experiments show us that scientists are eager to move past the public's discomforts. However, if clioning of humans were to become more widespread and therefore more acceptable, the value of a human life would diminish. From succesful cloning, things can go two ways: either governments will give human clones full rights or they won't. (or they could restrict the creation, but that wouldn't last.)The first is out of the question. Cloning would effectively divide the society into several groups, ranging from ""desirable"" citzens to ""undesirable"" ones, because everybody would know that the troublesome people aren't necessary. You can always clone good taxpayers and kill or banish half of the country to create a race of obedient people. Don't laugh, Hitler tried but didn't know the secrets of cloning. It would be like excising a tumor, getting rid of the bad cells to create better ones.The second would obviously lead to a very distopian world authors would portray through a book. We could clone humans, and have them do the dirty work for us. Mining, farming, clearing sewage; tasks like these would be taken over by the not-really-people people. Slavery would return, not everywhere but it would become a major issue even in the USA. Because why work when you can buy another to work for you? And if society ever gets to that state... well, we'll deserve the uprising we'll get.These are the fruits of science.2) Science also gives humans a greater capacity for destruction. The most famous example of scientific destruction is the nuclear bomb. If we look at some very early examples, the nuclear bomb named Little Boy had a yield of 16 kilotons. The largest nuclear weapon ever was detonated at half-strength by the USSR, and had a yield of 50 megatons. That's a bit less than 5,000 times what was dropped on Hiroshima. And it was only half-full. Over the years, USA has probably managed to pull together something that goes bang much louder on detonation. On this website there is a chart that I find portrays the situation quite well: ""http://www.businessinsider.com... in mind that the last one, Castle Bravo, was created in 1954. Some professors argue that if eight or more modern nuclear weapons were detonated on the surface at roughly the same time, 95% of Earth's life would die of either the blast, the radiation, or the nuclear winter following.These are the fruits of science3) Established technologies, such as the wireless smartphone, are dissecting families in first world countries. Many individuals are embracing autonomous lives on the internet, which pulls apart families as a unit. Mr. Anderson, the president of probe ministries and an author of many essays and books, thinks that it is specifically this dissection of a family that brings down nations. This is shown based on his studies of ancient Rome, Greece, Persia and Assyria; whenever families members started competing or not socializing, the nation slowly withered and died.Thes are the fruits of science.(1) http://www.abpischools.org.uk...(2) https://answers.yahoo.com...(2) http://en.wikipedia.org...;(2) http://www.businessinsider.com...;(2) http://www.answers.com...; (3) http://www.theatlantic.com...;(3) http://www.leaderu.com...;(3) https://www.probe.org...;http://idebate.org...;"	PRO	stem cell research expanded	stem cell research expand

Embryonic Stem cell research should be legalized	"Do you know of anyone in your friends or family that has a mental or physical defect that affects their life? More than 134 million parents, children, and friends across the United States have one form of serious mental or physical deficiency. Specialists have found a likely cure for AIDS, Alzheimer""s, ALS, blindness, and even cancer. However, those who have very strong ethical and religious views have hindered the specialists and patients that could be helped by this ""Universal cure"". Stem cell research has been a large issue of debate since its discovery some 30 years ago. Even with so many good effects that can come from this misunderstood subject, many people still oppose it. It is our job as a generation to push back the paranoia and the risks, and together we might just cure these millions of people who need our help. If we could cure even a fraction, we would be one step closer to a world without disease. What is a stem cell? A stem cell is the cell from which an embryo, it generally multiplies for the first month until it differentiates into the different types of cells such as brain cells, skin cells, nerve cells, and so on. How can a stem cell be used? An extracted stem cell may be given chemicals in order to convert into any type of cell in the human body. Once a single cell has been converted, it will continue to multiply until a full organ is made. What are the benefits of stem cell application? Unlike extracting organs from the deceased or the living to give to critical patients with organ complications, stem cell research can make the organs inside of any well-designed hospital, reducing the risk of damage to the organ from transportation, the critical time needed to get the organ to the patient, providing more organs into the hospitals so there would be no ""waiting line"" and reducing he effects of rejection from the human body. Why do people oppose it? Members of the Catholic faith and others who share their morals feel that an unborn fetus must be terminated in order for the stem cells to be retrieved. What these people may not know is that stem cells can be retrieved from the ""leftover"" tissue samples that were not part of the fetus when formation began, also if a woman has needs to abort her child for any reason, the embryonic stem cells can also be harvested during that time. Research on adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow of a healthy adult, have already saved tens of thousands of lives due to the transfer of the cells to necessary areas. However the adult stem cells can only be used to replace a select few cells, while embryonic cells can be used to duplicated any cell in the human body, and possibly save millions more. Even with so many good effects that can come from this misunderstood subject, many people still oppose it. It is our job as a generation to push back the paranoia and the risks, and together we might just cure these millions of people who need our help.

52	Sf0770da-A760eca8e	0	1	Should stem cell research be expanded?	Homosexual Marriage and Lifestyle: Detrimental and Not Necessarily About Equality.	"Despite what you might believe, gay marriage is about equality. You said there's a cottage industry dedicated to gay marriage. I hardly see the harm in that, boosting the economy and all. Ok, I brought up more than one point when I began this debate. One was homosexual marriage and the other homosexual lifestyle; How it""s detrimental and not necessarily about equality. I went on to explain that the homosexual lifestyle can adversely affect society and the homosexual as an individual. Please keep these distinct observations in mind, and refrain from taking all of my points as an argument against only one. The equality to get married is existent "" the recognition of the marriage by the government, however, is not equal. There""s a distinct difference between the two. The propaganda says that gays do not have equal rights to get married. The law states you can get married and have it recognized. It just has to be to a member of the opposite sex. There""s a reason why it""s been that way, and during my responses, you may grasp the reason. When you change the requirements, due to preference of sexual orientation, the law becomes something about personal desires and not what""s best for society. Here""s an illustration behind what I mean There""s a big difference between treating people equally and treating behavior equally. We do not recognize all behavior as equal. The terms heterosexual and homosexual are used to define sexual behavioral preferences. When you look on your birth certificate, you will see your name and your sex .. it says male or female. So we are defined as people being male or female"" not heterosexual or homosexual. gay marriage is less monogamous, ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help. That'd be like banning medicine because sick people use it. Andrew Sullivan's main point was that the lack of societal support for their monogamy may be the reason why [1]. Also, allowing gay marriage won't be an instant change because the culture would need time to adjust as well."" Ok, here: If you know that AIDS and other STDs run rampant in the homosexual community, and that is not enough to dissuade you from living that lifestyle, or convince you to practice monogamy, what makes YOU think that societal support or legalizing gay marriage will change that? ""If the lack of monogamy is a problem, then banning marriage would hardly help."" The lack of monogamy is the very point I am making. If the subject of marriage in the homosexual community is really about equality, then it begs to question why they are fighting for a right that statistics and studies show do not really fit with their particular lifestyle. Funny you used Andrew Sullivan, even though you say he doesn""t represent all gay people. I reiterate: Andrew Sullivan has even claimed that he doesn't believe that gay monogamy is possible. Instead, he claims that homosexuals ""need"" multiple partners! Apparently monogamy is not ""flexible"" enough for homosexuals. He calls monogamy a ""stifling model of heterosexual morality"" and thinks homosexuals have a greater ""understanding for the need for extramarital outlets."" Furthermore, Sullivan believes heterosexuals could learn from the promiscuity of homosexuals. He writes,"" something of the gay relationship""s necessary honesty, its flexibility, and its equality could undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds."" When you stated monogamy isn""t objectively better because sexual frequency tapers off in a long-term relationship "" That""s frankly not a good argument. It would seem that argument is derivative of the mindset that monogamy is strictly about sexual longevity. I""m married with kids, and I can tell you first-hand that marriage is about much more than sex. It""s about much more than love. It""s about commitment through thick and thin. Some people who get married, actually take marriage as a vow of devotion to one another. In marriage, there is sex and love, but also bond of trust, and for the majority of married couples, procreation. That married couple now has responsibility, not only to one another, but to those children to raise them, nurture them emotionally, and educate them in order to be productive members of society contributing to society""s existence. ""There are plenty of men who cheat with their wives and vice versa, and in a deceitful manner. Should marriage be banned for everyone because of the infidelity of others?"" No, it should not, because I have already provided the information which shows the benefits to society and children that come from a heterosexual marriage. And for the percentage of men who do not cheat, those particular marriages could arguably be considered a major contribution to society. By the way, women cheat too. I really don't think the United States of America is comparable to primitive tribes and civilizations. We're concerned about developing infrastructure and advanced technologies. They were worried about finding food and growing their numbers. ""The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."" The Mosuo people would disagree. I""d have to disagree with your refute of Unwin""s studies. Those civilizations he studied encompassed the Roman, Sumerian, and Babylonian empire. How old is the United States of America? 237 years, going on 238. The Roman Empire spanned over 1,300 years. And they were worried about more than finding food or growing their numbers "" In fact:"" The inventions and innovations which were generated in the Roman Empire profoundly altered the lives of the ancient people and continue to be used in cultures around the world today. Advancements in the construction of roads and buildings, indoor plumbing, aqueducts, and even fast-drying cement were either invented or improved upon by the Romans. The calendar used in the West derives from the one created by Julius Caesar, and the names of the days of the week (in the romance languages) and months of the year also come from Rome. Apartment complexes (known as `insula), public toilets, locks and keys, newspapers, even socks all were developed by the Romans as were shoes, a postal system (modeled after the Persians), cosmetics, the magnifying glass, and the concept of satire in literature. During the time of the empire, significant developments were also advanced in the fields of medicine, law, religion, government, and warfare. The Romans were adept at borrowing from, and improving upon, those inventions or concepts they found among the indigenous populace of the regions they conquered. It is therefore difficult to say what is an `original"" Roman invention and what is an innovation on a pre-existing concept, technique, or tool. It can safely be said, however, that the Roman Empire left an enduring legacy which continues to affect the way in which people live even today."" http://www.ancient.eu.com.... And that just covers the Roman empire. The Sumerian empire spanned about 4,200 years and their list of accomplishments are also note-worthy out-side increasing numbers and looking for food: http://www.ancient.eu.com... . Your example of the Mosuo people are an exception to the rule. Just because there is an example of a society which operates outside of traditional monogamy, that does not refute the value of traditional monogamy as a whole. It also does not refute the years of study conducted by Unwin. Furthermore, you failed to include a key aspect in the Mosuo culture: ""While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time."" A term called ""serial monogamy""- So monogamy, nonetheless. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006). The Mosuo: Walking Marriages. I find it interesting that when I made my point with Unwin, you dismissed the tribes of his research as being irrelevant, yet opted to provide a tribe of about 40,000 individuals as an example to refute my point. ""AIDS is rampant in the homosexual community. Again, I don't see how banning gay marriage would help fix that."" I go back to my beginning statement in this rebuttal. This specific point is not necessarily an argument against gay marriage, as much as to point out the detriment of the lifestyle to the homosexual as an individual, and society. The United States and other countries recognize this detriment as well: Specifically, the United States recognizes the lifestyle being detrimental, hence the current ban against donated blood from men who have sex with other men. If it were natural and ""..is not detrimental to society in anyway whatsoever"", as you claimed, why the ban in our country and other countries? Better yet, if you needed blood, and it were legal, would you knowingly accept blood from a man you knew to be gay without thinking twice? If you had the choice between a heterosexual and homosexual""s blood, given no background or info in that setting, what would you gamble with? http://en.wikipedia.org... I""d post a link to substantiate AIDS being prevalent in the homosexual community, but I don""t think that fact will be disputed. ""First off, it drives me nuts that you didn't cite your sources. Merely stating ""surveys say"" does not allow me the chance to review their highly questionable conclusions without speculating their method. Also, this is gay adoption, not gay marriage, so it's off topic. While I do disagree with your point, I'd like to stay focused on the issue of our debate."" It""s not off topic. This is a detriment to society "" one of the key topics I brought up when I started this debate. Children from natural marriages (man and woman) are seven times less likely to live in poverty, six times less likely to commit suicide, less than half as likely to commit crime, less than half as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, and they develop better academically and socially. However, children from fatherless homes are seven times more likely to live in poverty, six times more likely to commit suicide, more than twice as likely to commit crime, more than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock, worse off academically and socially "" and account for 60 percent of Amercia""s rapists, 63 percent of America""s youth suicide, 70 percent of America""s long-term prison inmates and reform school attendees, 71 percent of America""s teenage pregnancies, 72 percent of America""s adolescent murderers, 85 percent of America""s youth prisoners, 85 percent of America""s youth with behavioral disorders, and 90 percent of America""s runaways. http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com... I have already pointed out that homosexual couples effectively remove either the father or the mother from the home. They claim that there""s no difference, but a far more recent study says other-wise: http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu... This study was conducted utilizing an impressive 20% of Canada""s 2006 Census, and at the time of this census, Canada""s same-sex couples had enjoyed all taxation and government benefits since 1997 and legal same-sex marriage since 2005. The study concluded that children of married opposite-sex families have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and the other four types (common law heterosexual couple, single mother, single father, and gay male couple) are similar to each other and lie in between the married opposite-sex household and lesbian household extremes. Allen summarizes his findings on the effect of parent and child genders in same-sex households as follows: ""the results on high school graduation rates suggest that children living in both gay and lesbian households struggle compared to children from opposite sex married households. In general, it appears that these children are only about 65% as likely to graduate from high school compared to the [married opposite-sex] control group""a difference that holds whether conditioned on controls or not. When the households are broken down by child gender it appears that daughters are struggling more than sons, and that daughters of gay [male] parents have strikingly low graduation rates. The latter conclusions are worthy of greater clarity, because they are the first findings that can really address the effects of fatherlessness or motherlessness on boys and girls in same-sex households. These data indicate that the specific gender mix of a same-sex household makes a ""dramatic difference"" in the association with child graduation. Girls in lesbian households were only 45% as likely to graduate compared to girls from homes with both a mother and a father. More strikingly, girls from gay male households were only 15% as likely to graduate as girls from an opposite-sex household. A parallel comparison for boys in lesbian households found them to be 76% as likely to graduate as their male peers in opposite-sex households. Finally, boys in gay male households were found to be 61% more likely to graduate than boys in opposite-sex households. However, Allen added that the results for boys, unlike those for girls, were not statistically significant. Looking at these differences from another angle, Allen""s findings indicated that in gay male households, sons achieved a 72% graduation rate and daughters achieved a 43% graduation rate. For lesbian households, the graduate rates were 48% for boys and 55% for girls. Allen notes that such differences seem inconsistent with blanket claims of discrimination as an explanation for these findings, which he summarizes as indicating ""sons do better with fathers, and daughters do better with mothers."" And this is just covering the subject of education. ""gay marriage causes more illegitimate child births, and crime in turn."" Here you go: ""Demand for Same Sex Marriage: Evidence from the United States, Canada, and Europe,"" http://www.marriagedebate.com... gay sex isn't normal Actually, I said ..""there""s nothing inherently loving, healthy, or natural about inserting a penis into the anus."" Yeah, the standard response is, ""It""s natural or normal for me because it""s what I prefer."" And I don""t mean ""natural"" in the sense of preference, but ""natural"" in the sense as to how the human body is designed to function. You and I have all manner of ""natural"" desires to do things that are physically destructive, (tobacco use, getting drunk, violence, etc.,) and those things often feel good. However, we don""t excuse those behaviors because they come ""naturally"". Hence anti-smoking adds, ""Don""t be THAT guy"" posters, etc.,. Sorry, but the human body was not designed for anal intercourse. Science already shows the function of the anus. Its sole purpose is to excrete waste. Notice everyone has the same body part designed to excrete waste, yet we possess unique body parts for sexual functions. The same way science shows the functions of the vagina and penis. Furthermore, it is in line with what human bodies are designed to do "" not what they desire to do. I""d also like to point out that heterosexuals couples have been known to perform this kind of sexual activity as well. I""d apply the same argument to them as well. The following provides a link as to the purpose of the anus: http://www.health24.com... Since the beginning of time, the anus has also been accepted by many cultures as an erogenous zone, explaining the act of anal stimulation. The anal walls are rich in nerve endings that can give a feeling of pleasure. Many homosexual and heterosexual people practice this form of intercourse. However, anal sex should always be practiced with a condom and a good water-based lubricant. It is very possible for the walls of the rectum to be torn either through a very solid stool, or by rough anal sex. This puts the receiver at a much higher risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and other bacterial infections. What gives you the right to decide that? What gives you the right to ask that question? I""d also like to add some illustrations as to how homosexuality and homosexual marriage have and will possibly affect society: Freedom of speech and religion will be restricted: Any disagreement with homosexuality or homosexual marriage will automatically be deemed as hate speech and intolerance. Regardless of how cordial it is stated. It""s already happening. I, personally, have already been accused of being intolerant, which I find hypocritical on the part of my accusers if you actually look up the definition of tolerance. The people accusing me of being intolerant are being intolerant. The only tolerance granted will be reserved for those who support the homosexual activist position. And that""s not tolerance at all. Funny thing: How can you demonstrate tolerance unless you know another person""s opinion? How can you express an opinion unless you speak it or write it? Here are some examples: http://www.lifesitenews.com... In Lexington, Ky., a T-shirt shop called Hands On Originals was approached by the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization about printing shirts for the group. The T-shirt company politely declined and even sought out quotes and gave the group referrals to other T-shirt printers, along with comparable prices. They were promptly sued by the group under Lexington""s anti-discriminatory laws and forced to comply with a lengthy investigation. Christian photographers Elane Photography in New Mexico were approached by a same sex couple looking to hire a wedding photographer. Elane Photography politely declined citing their Christian faith and were sued by the couple under the state""s anti-discriminatory laws, and won. In New Mexico you apparently have no right to your free expression and practice of faith any longer. Owners of a small, privately owned inn in Vermont declined to host a same sex wedding reception due to their religious views and were sued. A same-sex couple from California sued a Hawaiian bed and breakfast privately owned by a Christian woman for not allowing them to rent a room. A Methodist church in New Jersey was sued for not offering its facility for use during same-sex weddings. A judge ruled against the church. Canada and Sweden already restrict speech against homosexuality to the point that even pastors have been fined or jailed: http://townhall.com... Possibilities and things that are happening: Social Security taxes will be increased (or benefits decreased) in order to pay survivor support benefits to homosexual ""widows"" and ""widowers"" Medical insurance premiums will rise to offset the higher health care costs associated with homosexual behavior, i.e., AIDS, colon cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. Furthermore premiums would rise further if insurance companies are mandated to cover fertility treatments for lesbian couples. Employee benefits will be reduced as employers are mandated to spread their limited benefit dollars to include homosexual partners. Limited benefit dollars given to homosexuals must come from somewhere; indeed, they will probably be taken away from everyone else ""including married couples raising children. Homosexuals will probably be given legal preference to adopt due to their inability to procreate. In other words, not granted equal rights, but super rights. So kids become trophies that validate the normality of their lifestyle. Children will be indoctrinated without parental consent to accept homosexual behavior and same sex marriage as the moral and social equivalent of heterosexual behavior and marriage (Already taking place in the public schools of California and Massachusetts) "" granted, this one is a stretch to me because even though it""s a concern, as the parent, they could opt to put them in a private school, or homeschool. The workplace will attempt to indoctrinate you. If you refuse to be a ""team player"", you could lose your job . This is already happening in the Military. On the record, you have to agree with the lifestyle, and say it""s ok. Off the record, if you are not on duty, and you explain your personal opinion to someone else, you will experience a backlash if another person listening takes offense. If none of what I have presented is a sign of how homosexuality is detrimental to society, then I would daresay you""re being intellectually dishonest. However, to make the absolute assertion that it does not have a detrimental effect on society anyway whatsoever is a pretty bold statement. I posted what my beliefs were about the subject and provided the reasons why. If you""re going to refute, with absolute certainty, then the burden of proof would be to show how it is not detrimental, and how it equates as equally in contributing to our past, present, and future society the way heterosexual marriage has. And maybe that""s part of the reason why societies past have placed a higher value on heterosexual marriages and grant them benefits they do not grant homosexual couples in marriage "" because Governments past have recognized how heterosexual marriage actually contributes to society. I apologize for not writing sooner, but I had to take my wife to the hospital yesterday and we didn""t get home until midnight. I thought about relinquishing the debate, but she has felt well enough for me to rotate between taking care of her, the kids, and finishing this final rebuttal. Thanks for debating with me!"
