Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

    Hi, I'm not very smart with electronics so I'm asking for your help. Might be a stupid one, but better to be safe. So I've been vaping for a few months now and always charged my vape with the USB cable from my laptop ( I have iJust 3 ) . So the thing is that I'll soon a take a vacation, and I'm not gone take my laptop with me , just to charge my vape, So I'm wondering if I can charge it with my phone charger, I have 2 different phone chargers, One is with Output - 5V=1500mA , and other one is with Output - 5.0V=1000mA, So can I use any of them to charge my vape from wall socket? The iJust 3 apparently has some sort if charging safety features, and looking up on google, a lot of people are saying that u can charge it, but to be safe, I rather ask here.

    :)

    It should be fine - I think the important bit is 5V. The iJust will only take the current (mA) it needs.

    I sometimes use a 5V 2A charger and it doesn't seem to cause problems.

    Someone will correct me if I'm wrong!

    You are correct, the device will draw what it needs. Using a 2A charger is actually better IMO, even if the device doesn't draw 2A. If you draw the max current (or higher) from a charger, then you are stressing it.

    All of my plug in adapters these days are 2A.

    Thanks everyone for fast respond.
    But I'll definitely watch it so it doesn't overheat.

    Just be sure to charge it on a flame resistant surface, like on the bathroom countertop. Should something go bad, it can be dramatic.

    totally fine, as others told, be sure the surface, and also, a fresh place would be another thing to consider, i always charge my batteries close by a fan at my office desk...

    The iJust 3 has circuit protection so you don't have to worry about over-charging it. However, the Smok Stick X8 is also advertised having circuit protection :eek:. Overheating is usually the main cause of battery explode so if you want to be safe. Just check your iJust after 1 or 2 hours to see if it's too hot.
