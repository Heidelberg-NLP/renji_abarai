Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should the U.S. Government Increase the Minimum Wage?

Should the U.S. Government Increase the Minimum Wage?

A call for minimum wage raise is a very controversial topic for all economists. Generally speaking, a minimum wage is the lowest amount of wage per hour that employers legally are obligated to pay their workers. The United States’ federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since July 24, 2009. Some states obey its federal law, and some decided to have their own special state minimum wage laws. State of Washington D.C., for example, has its own state minimum wage of $9.50 per hour – the highest state minimum wage per hour. Employers must pay their employees with rate between the United States federal minimum wage and state minimum wage – or higher.

The topic of minimum wage raise has brought up recently when President Barack Obama called to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour. President Obama’s call certainly brought the nation’s attention. Some agrees with him, but many also disagrees with his decision.

The main reason for a minimum wage raise is to help the low income people and families. In the United States, there are approximately 35 million people who live their daily life receiving the $7.25 per hour paycheck or near lowest wage. This is about 30% of population in workplace. With inflation, economists believe it has decreased a real purchasing power of low income people. They believe that increase in minimum wage rate would increase the purchasing power and circulate the business cycle. Additionally, economists argue that there will be a relatively small number of job losses. As a result, the benefits of higher wages outweigh the costs of lost jobs. For example, a study shows that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would reduce the number of people in poverty by 900,000.

On the other hand, there are some economists and people who are against a minimum wage increase. The very first reason is because businesses do not want government interference. They do not believe the government should tell them how much they need to pay their workers. Some economists argue that increasing the minimum wage does significantly reduce the number of jobs. For example, a study estimated that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would reduce the total employment by 500,000. Fewer entry-level jobs means fewer inexperienced workers will have the opportunity to gain valuable job skills and experience. Also, the working poor bear a disproportionate share of jobs loss. Furthermore, some people believe that increase in minimum wage will result outsourcing and illegal immigrant hiring.

After President Obama’s call to raise the minimum wage rate from $7.25 to $10.10, many believed that it is necessary and many believe it is not. Raising the minimum wage will definitely give low income people an extra dollar in their pocket to purchase their needs. However, many worries its consequences such as losing jobs and inflation. Increasing the minimum wage is still a very controversial topic for everyone.

    Definitely controversial! I’ve heard my parents debate this many times. It’s hard to decide, but my I tend to favor the argument that if U.S. employers are forced to pay their workers more, they’ll hire less. People love to jump at the government with any chance they can get, and I worry a minimum wage boost will lead to them decreasing their hiring rates out of spite (although…I’m not sure they’re allowed to do this…just my opinion, though).

    Don’t get me wrong, I am not 100% against Obama’s proposed change. I would love to see more money in the pockets of the many impoverished Americans, and a boom in business and money circulation. As an economics major, you probably are a lot more aware of the technicalities that feed into the implications of this change. What are your thoughts? Are you pro- or anti-minimum wage increase?
