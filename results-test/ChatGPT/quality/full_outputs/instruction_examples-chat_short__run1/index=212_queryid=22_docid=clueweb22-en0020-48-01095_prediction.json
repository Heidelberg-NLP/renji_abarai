The lack of resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not only hurts the Palestinians but also directly affects Israel. The economic measures may delay an explosion, but they cannot prevent it. The writer believes that the lack of willingness of the current Israeli government to negotiate must be challenged and that the government should reopen negotiations with the Palestinians. Overall, the style is clear, and the argument is well-structured and easy to follow, so I would rate it as \"high.\""
