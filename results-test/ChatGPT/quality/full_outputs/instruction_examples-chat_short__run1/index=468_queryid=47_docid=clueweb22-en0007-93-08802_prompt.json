Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

The Great Homework Debate

0

Over the summer, the PTO for my daughter’s school was pushing really hard to eliminate homework from elementary school. There were a lot of views brought up, and it was a really good debate. A new principal was coming in, and we all thought it was apt timing to bring this issue up (again). We first pushed for it about three years ago.

An educator of 15 years that is part of our community was the one who initiated the conversation. Her perspective, from that of a teacher (of at-risk and accelerated students) and from that of a parent, homework does not improve learning at the grade school level.

homework

Most of the comments included tales of their children crying most nights and the nightmare that homework can be for many households (mine included!). Some teachers commented that they had made their own decision not to require homework and focused instead on classroom learning. One parent was all for the “no homework movement,” but thought it would be good for her sixth-grader to have it just as preparation for middle school.

Another common thread was that having a reading log and spelling words to work on from home were beneficial.

My husband does much better with our fourth-grader at homework time (he has much more patience than I do), but somehow I always end up having my daughter in tears after the first few minutes of helping her with homework. Besides, this “new math” gives me “new” anxieties! I do understand how different methods are beneficial to how different kids’ brains work uniquely, but this is another whole topic for another time…

Here are some recaps from both sides in our grade school community:

Pros to “No Homework”
  • Less tears in the evening
  • More fun, family time
  • Less grading for teachers
  • Less frustration for parents
  • Kids get to be kids more
  • Decreased pressure on young kids
Cons to “No Homework”
  • Possibly unprepared for middle/high school
  • Less parent engagement in school work
  • Less cultivation of study habits
  • Chance of less-rounded education overall
  • Indeterminate research on the issue

How many of you have seen research on this great homework debate, and what are your thoughts? Does your child’s school have a no homework policy? If so, how has this affected your child’s learning and testing scores?
