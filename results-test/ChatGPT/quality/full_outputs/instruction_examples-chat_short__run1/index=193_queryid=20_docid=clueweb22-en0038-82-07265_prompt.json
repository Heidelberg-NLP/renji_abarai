Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?

General Reference (not clearly pro or con)

Biology Online, an informational website about biology, included this definition in its “Dictionary” section (accessed Feb. 20, 2007):

“Milk – A white fluid secreted by the mammary glands of female mammals for the nourishment of their young, consisting of minute globules of fat suspended in a solution of casein, albumin, milk sugar, and inorganic salts.”

Feb.20, 2007 - Biology Online

Douglas Goff, PhD, Professor of Food Science at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, stated on his webpage “Dairy Chemistry and Physics” (accessed Feb. 20, 2007):

“The role of milk in nature is to nourish and provide immunological protection for the mammalian young… Milk is also a very complex food with over 100,000 different molecular species found. There are many factors that can affect milk composition such as breed variations, cow to cow variations, herd to herd variations – including management and feed considerations, seasonal variations, and geographic variations. With all this in mind, only an approximate composition of milk can be given: 87.3% water (range of 85.5% – 88.7%); 3.9% milkfat (range of 2.4% – 5.5%); 8.8% solids-non-fat (range of 7.9% – 10.0%) including protein (3.25%), lactose (4.6%), minerals (0.65%), acids (0.18%), enzymes, gases, and vitamins…

Due to its role in nature, milk is in a liquid form. This may seem curious if one takes into consideration the fact that milk has less water than most fruits and vegetables. Milk can be described as an oil-in-water emulsion with the fat globules dispersed in the continuous serum phase, a colloid suspension of casein micelles, globular proteins and lipoprotein particles, and a solution of lactose, soluble proteins, minerals, vitamins and other components.”

Walter L. Hurley, PhD, Professor of Animal Science at the University of Illinois, provided the following definition on his website “Lactation Biology” (accessed Feb. 20, 2007):

“The newborn mammal is still very much dependent on the mother for provision of a nutrient supply that matches its digestive capabilities. This nutrient supply is milk…

Milk is of paramount importance to survival, proper development, and vigorous growth of the neonate [newborn]. Milk is the only supply of the water, organic nutrients, and minerals to which the neonate has access. Milk supplies everything to the neonate except air! It has a high caloric value and generally is balanced for the nutrient needs of the rapidly developing young of that species. Colostrum (the first milk taken from the mammary gland after parturition) and mature milk also contain nonnutrient substances (such as antibodies and bioactive factors) that may be important for growth, development, and survival of the neonate.”

Feb.20, 2007 - Walter L. Hurley, PhD

Britannica Concise Encyclopedia offered the following description (accessed Feb. 21, 2007):

“Liquid secreted by the mammary glands of female mammals to nourish their young. The milk of domesticated animals is also an important food source for humans. Most milk consumed in Western countries is from cows; other important sources include sheep, goats, water buffalo, and camels. Milk is essentially an emulsion of fat and protein in water, along with dissolved sugar, minerals (including calcium and phosphorous), and vitamins, particularly vitamin B complex. Commercially processed cow’s milk is commonly enriched with vitamins A and D.”

Melissa Majumdar, MS, registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, stated in a June 5, 2019 article by Emily Shiffer titled “The Surprising Health Benefits of Milk,” available at oprahmag.com:

“Drinking milk is a great way to meet needs for nine essential nutrients, including: phosphorus, B12, calcium, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin D, riboflavin, niacin, and protein. Most non-dairy milks contain only 2-4 nutrients and generally lack protein; they may also have added sugars if sweetened. Milk, on the other hand, has a natural balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fat (in low fat milks).”

Katherine Zeratsky, RD, registered dietitian nutritionist at the Mayo Clinic, wrote in an Apr. 9, 2019 article by Liza Torborg titled “Mayo Clinic Q and A: Dairy Milk, Soy Milk, Almond Milk — Which Is the Healthiest Choice for You?,” available at newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org:

“Cow’s milk (dairy) and other plant-based beverages, including soy milk and almond milk, all can be healthy choices. However, there are wide nutritional differences, depending on the type of product and the brand…

Comparing protein content, dairy milk takes the protein title with a little over 8 grams per cup…

When considering calcium, dairy milk naturally has about 300 milligrams per cup, and dairy products generally are considered the best absorbed source of calcium…

In summary, it’s tough to beat dairy milk for balanced nutrition — with nonfat skim milk the best choice for most adults.”

“Milk is good for the bones because it offers a rich source of calcium, a mineral essential for healthy bones and teeth. Cow’s milk is fortified with vitamin D, which also benefits bone health. Calcium and vitamin D help prevent osteoporosis…

Cow’s milk is a source of potassium, which can enhance vasodilation and reduce blood pressure. Increasing potassium intake and decreasing sodium can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease…

Cow’s milk is a rich source of high-quality protein, containing all of the essential amino acids. Whole milk is also a rich source of energy in the form of saturated fat, which can prevent muscle mass being used for energy…

Osteoarthritis of the knee currently has no cure, but researchers say drinking milk every day has been linked to reduced progression of the disease…

Milk is also a rich source of choline; an important nutrient found to support sleep, muscle movement, learning and memory. Choline helps to maintain the structure of cellular membranes, aids in the transmission of nerve impulses, assists in the absorption of fat and can lessen chronic inflammation.”

The National Dairy Council (NDC), in its Jan. 9, 2017 resource titled “Is Milk Good for You?,” available from their website, wrote:

“Your body needs certain nutrients to function properly, and milk contains many of those nutrients. For example, milk is an excellent source of calcium, which can help build and maintain strong bones and teeth. It also contains a number of B vitamins (vitamin B 12, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and niacin), which can help your body convert food into fuel.”

An Assessment of the Totality of Scientific Evidence,” available from ncbi.nlm.gov, wrote:

“The most recent evidence suggested that intake of milk and dairy products was associated with reduced risk of childhood obesity. In adults, intake of dairy products was shown to improve body composition and facilitate weight loss during energy restriction. In addition, intake of milk and dairy products was associated with a neutral or reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly stroke. Furthermore, the evidence suggested a beneficial effect of milk and dairy intake on bone mineral density but no association with risk of bone fracture. Among cancers, milk and dairy intake was inversely associated with [protective against] colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, and not associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or lung cancer, while the evidence for prostate cancer risk was inconsistent. Finally, consumption of milk and dairy products was not associated with all-cause mortality.”

The Dairy All-Party Parliamentary Group, a cross-party interest group of UK MPs (Members of Parliament), in a Mar. 2016 report titled “Putting Dairy Back on the Daily Menu,” available from dairyuk.org, wrote:

“Dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt are naturally nutrient rich foods. Milk, hard cheese and yogurt are the number one source of calcium in the UK diet. They also contain a wealth of other key nutrients such as protein, riboflavin, vitamin B12, iodine, phosphorus and potassium, all of which play an essential role in a healthy diet.

Calcium and other bone friendly nutrients found in milk and dairy are important in developing bone. This is particularly important in childhood and adolescent children as these are critical periods for bone growth and skeletal development…

The dairy food group is also an excellent source of iodine, an important mineral needed to form hormones in the thyroid. These hormones are necessary for a number of body processes, including metabolism regulation and proper foetal brain development.”
