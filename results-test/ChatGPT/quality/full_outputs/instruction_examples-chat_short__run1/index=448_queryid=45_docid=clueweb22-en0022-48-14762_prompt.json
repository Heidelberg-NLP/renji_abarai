Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Revitive Medic Review

Alex Davies

When you have arthritis or circulation problems, the constant pain and swelling in your feet and legs is often hard to manage. 

It can end up significantly affecting your lifestyle. Preventing you from doing the things you love, whether it’s walking, going out in nature, or even seeing friends. 

A circulation booster like Revitive aims to help with this pain and to reduce the discomfort in the legs and feet. It does this by increasing blood circulation in your legs.

This enhanced circulation can reduce swelling as well as soothe leg aches and cramps. 

But how effective is Revitive? Here we review this popular circulation-boosting device to help you assess whether it really works. 

First, a little more about what it does and how it does it.

What is a Circulation Booster?

A circulation booster is a medical device that can help increase the circulation of a user’s feet and legs. It uses Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS), which means the device is also drug-free. [1]

EMS helps contract and relax the user’s muscles. The contractions help pump blood into the legs and feet—imitating the way the circulatory system works. This can increase the blood flow in the user’s legs and feet.

Users of circulation boosters found that by increasing blood circulation, they experienced relief from muscle ache and reduced swelling in the legs and feet.

How Does the Revitive Circulation Booster Achieve Its Results?

Revitive works similarly by delivering Electrical Muscle Stimulation to your feet and legs.

The EMS comes from a pair of cushioned footpads that you place your feet on. 

The EMS causes contractions in the muscles of the calf and foot. These contractions help improve the circulation in the lower legs.

Revitive is also capable of delivering EMS to other parts of the body using body pads, which come included with the device.

These pads can be stuck onto affected areas and can stimulate the knees, back, arms, and shoulders.

What Conditions Can Revitive Help With?

Revitive helps to strengthen muscles and to improve blood circulation. So any symptoms related with illness that cause or lead to poor circulation could potentially be helped by using Revitive.

These include high blood pressure and diabetes, which are not normally associated with circulation-boosting devices.

Revitive can also help with general pain and swelling in the lower legs, which could be from a number of causes:

  • Lower leg pain and cramps
  • Swollen legs and feet
  • Osteoarthritis
  • Diabetes
  • High blood pressure
  • High cholesterol
  • Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
  • Varicose Veins 
  • Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI)

It’s also a great solution for those who don’t have a medical condition but who have a general feeling of tiredness in their legs and feet.

What Are the Benefits of Revitive?

Some of the benefits you could experience when using Revitive include:

  • Reduced leg pain and cramps: which prevent you from doing daily activities like walking. 
  • Reduced swelling: in particular in the feet and ankles.
  • Increased circulation: regular use of the device can increase circulation in the treated areas.
  • Improved muscle strength: by exercising the muscles, Revitive can improve muscle strength. Our muscle mass starts to decline after the age of 30, and this can lead to muscle weakness over time. Revitive can help slow down that process by providing daily stimulation. 
  • Increased flexibility: Revitive can help improve your range of motion even if you don’t perform strenuous exercises.

Which Revitive is Best?

Revitive has several models available in the US, but the Revitive Medic is their best known and most popular. It can offer relief for lower leg pain, increased circulation, and reduced swelling.

They also have their Revitive Medic Knee, which specifically targets knee arthritis or osteoarthritis.

Revitive Advanced is a simpler version of the Revitive Medic and is better for those who have milder symptoms of tired feet with some swelling.

Here we look at the Revitive’s US models, but if you’re interested in the Revitive UK range you can found out more about these devices in our article: Revitive UK Medic Review.

Revitive Circulation Booster Claims and Features

We’ve taken a closer look at some of the claims and features of the Revitive Circulation Booster Device, so you can get a better idea of how it can benefit you.

Device is Compact and Portable

With a 14-inch diameter and weighing around 3 pounds, the device is easy to carry.

You can even take your Revitive with you when you travel. 

Other circulation boosters in the market have bulky and space-consuming designs. In comparison, the Revitive can be moved around and stored away easily. For example in a small closet or under the bed.

Wide Range of Intensity Levels Offered

When you look at other circulation-boosting devices, you’ll notice that most of them have intensity settings.

These settings will allow you to adjust the device’s intensity to suit your comfort level and needs. Most of the time, you’ll have the choice between 1-5 different setting levels

Revitive allows you to choose intensity levels between 1 and 99. So you get a significantly wider range of strength options. 

Why is this good for you?

It means that you can choose the intensity level that best suits your body and which gives you the best results.

Revitive advise that you should always start at the highest setting that you can tolerate comfortably.

You can then gradually build up the intensity as your body and muscles become accustomed to the device.

The wide range of intensity levels also means that Revitive can be useful for other family members who use the device. It allows them to choose the intensity level that suits them.

FDA-Cleared Medical Device

Revitive is an FDA-approved Class IIA medical device.

Being FDA-cleared is a guarantee that Revitive has passed testing and is approved for use to help with the conditions associated with poor circulation.

Although other products in the market claim to help improve circulation, many of them don’t have FDA clearance. 

If you plan on buying a product that can affect your health, buying one that’s tested by the proper authorities is always the smart thing to do.

Revitive Medic IsoRocker

Patented Technology

Revitive uses patented technology to help you deal with circulation and joint problems.

Their patented isoRocker is what makes your feet rock forwards and backwards on the device.

It helps to keep the joints moving in a similar way to how they move when walking. But in a much gentler motion. 

Patented technology is something that a company develops independently. It shows that Revitive has invested in its product and in the research behind it.

15 Stimulation Patterns

Revitive uses a variety of EMS patterns to keep your muscles stimulated over time.

This is so that your muscles are less likely to build up a tolerance to a particular frequency.

Instead, there are 15 stimulation patterns to choose from. These are called ‘Widepulse Waveforms’.

They keep your muscles challenged even with regular use of the device.
