Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Gavin Newsom announces plan to enact gun control measure inspired by Texas abortion law

California could be the first state to use Texas' novel legal tactics for its own ends. It likely won't be the last

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a new plan Saturday that would use the legal maneuvering Texas has employed to enact the country's most restrictive abortion ban — but instead targeting those who sell assault rifles or so-called "ghost gun" parts that allow buyers to build untraceable weapons. 

It's a novel approach that would use the same threat of vigilante lawsuits to enact a liberal priority that has long languished in Congress. Newsom's announcement also comes on the heels of a Supreme Court ruling that allowed Texas to keep its new provision in place as lawsuits against it make their way through the courts. 

In a statement released over the weekend, Newsom claimed his staff is working with both the California Legislature and the state's attorney general to draft a bill similar to Texas' S.B. 8, that would allow private citizens nationwide to file lawsuits "against anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells an assault weapon or ghost gun kit or parts in the State of California."

"If the most efficient way to keep these devastating weapons off our streets is to add the threat of private lawsuits, we should do just that."

Previously, the California governor said he was "outraged" that the Supreme Court allowed Texas' six-week abortion law to stand. It's a timeframe that bans nearly all abortions, because the first six weeks of pregnancy often passes before a woman even knows she is pregnant. 

Reports suggest the high court, stacked with three members nominated by former President Donald Trump, may be leaning toward ruling in Texas' favor — effectively ending the decades of protection given to abortion rights after the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade.

Newsom's plan to use the same legal tactic as Texas to enact his own state's policy priorities is a future at least partially predicted by Justice Elena Kagan, who has previously argued in court recently that "we would live in a very different world from the world we live in today" if S.B. 8 is allowed to stand.

"Essentially, we would be inviting states, all 50 of them, with respect to their own preferred constitutional rights, to try to nullify the law this court has laid down," she said. 

In another Tweet, Newsom argued "if that's the precedent," he would have to embrace the tactic whether he liked it or not.

"If states can now shield their laws from review by the federal courts that compare assault weapons to Swiss Army Knives, then California will use that authority to protect people's lives, where Texas used it to put women in harm's way," he wrote.

"If TX can ban abortion and endanger lives, CA can ban deadly weapons of war and save lives."
