Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Adults Really Shouldn't Drink Human Breast Milk

The breast milk black market is lucrative and booming, as the nourishment for babies has become increasingly popular among some men who believe drinking it improves athletic performance or can cure life-threatening and chronic diseases such as cancer and erectile dysfunction. Some men who buy breast milk on the black market also claim to be fulfilling a fetishistic need, while others say it is a "clean" source of protein or contains antibodies that could boost the adult immune system.

$100 looking for long term supply of fresh milk in San diego

Young white professional male, DDF looking for same. No judgment no drama looking for long term supply from open minded mother. Price is negotiable.

I am a dental assistant here in lansing Mi. I have a surplus of milk and looking to make extra diaper money. Im a 27 year old mother of 2. I have a 7 year old boy and 1 month old healthy chubbie baby girl 8.5lbs at birth. Great tasty breast milk from me ( the healthy mother) to you!!! No adult wet nursing no pictures no videos!

But breast milk's purported benefits to adults are not supported by science. In fact, research shows it may be a health hazard. A new paper published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine looked for the science to back up the black market claims. Simply put: Breast milk definitely isn't for grown-ups.

The authors, led by Dr. Sarah Steele, a professor of the Global Health and Policy Unit at Queen Mary University of London, say breast milk won't improve health or sports performance. There's less protein in human breast milk than cow's milk, and any adult who claims a health boost from breast milk is probably experiencing a textbook case of the placebo effect, say the authors.

It's not so surprising that some people have come to believe that a few glasses of mother's milk could be a magic elixir for an adult. Plenty of research shows that breast milk is more beneficial than formula for a baby's physical and cognitive development. One study found that breastfed babies are even more likely to turn out better educated and earn more money as adults.

Most mothers selling their goods on the black market aren't concerned with quality control, which means many don't sufficiently sanitize before pumping. Lack of refrigeration during transport also provides ample opportunity for the milk to become contaminated with bacteria that may cause foodborne illness.

Additionally, black market breast milk may contain other pathogens that cause serious infectious diseases, including hepatitis, syphilis and HIV; many of these diseases do not have symptoms, so a woman may even be unaware that she's sick when she sells her milk.

The known health risks to buyers have given rise to a number of ventures to keep the breast milk market safe. The Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA), founded in 1985, was created to help set national standards for the productâ€”an attempt to make the market a little more legitimate. Today, the HMBANA is a professional association made up of 18 nonprofit donor milk banks in the U.S. and Canada, and with more opening in the next couple of years. The organization interviews potential donors and conducts health screens to ensure their product is safe.

But that milk is still meant for babies, not bodybuilders, and the health risks still exist.
