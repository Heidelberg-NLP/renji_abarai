Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

$380 billion juggernaut UnitedHealth is getting into one of the hottest parts of healthcare, and that should be a warning for upstarts like Hims and Ro

  • Industry giant UnitedHealth Group is pushing into the direct-to-consumer healthcare market.
  • The company's Optum business is selling generic drugs and virtual care to people who pay with cash.
  • The move brings new competition to digital-health upstarts such as Ro and Hims.

UnitedHealth Group is coming for Ro and Hims.

The $383 billion parent company of the country's largest health insurer has taken a page from the playbook of venture-backed direct-to-consumer startups and has started selling prescription drugs online to people paying with cash.

UnitedHealth is the largest US healthcare company by profit. Its net income totaled $15.8 billion in 2020. Johnson & Johnson, the second largest healthcare company, reported 2020 profit of $14.7 billion.

Optum, UnitedHealth's fastest growing business, quietly revamped its online pharmacy, called the Optum Store, to sell more than 800 generic drugs at discounted prices to people who forgo using their insurance.

Optum is also offering cash-only telehealth

services so people can get prescriptions for birth control or medication to treat anxiety, depression , erectile dysfunction, and other common illnesses. Soon it will offer treatment for hair loss, its website said.

Optum is veering into the territory of digital-health startups such as Ro and Hims, which offer telehealth and prescription drugs online for some of the same ailments Optum is tackling. Ro also has a mail-order pharmacy that delivers more than 1,000 generic drugs to people's homes.

UnitedHealth said the Optum Store is a way to increase access to affordable healthcare.

"Optum Store is one example of our commitment to offer consumers meaningful choices and encourage engagement throughout their health and care journey," a UnitedHealth spokesperson said.

But it's clear to industry observers that Optum's push into the direct-to-consumer world is a bid to own another piece of the healthcare system and keep its customers' healthcare dollars in-house, rather than losing them to VC-backed startups or Amazon, which launched its online pharmacy in November. As more Americans pay directly for their healthcare, UnitedHealth is now catering to people who use insurance and those who can't afford to use it.

A.J. Loiacono, the CEO of the pharmacy benefit manager Capital Rx, said traditional healthcare companies are playing defense as new players enter the market providing access to cheaper prices.

"Some of these new partnerships or offerings are a direct result of new entrants into the market, such as Amazon and Walmart, enhancing their presence in healthcare," he said.

Optum is selling generic drugs and virtual care for cash

The Optum Store launched in November 2020, and in late June it added pharmacy and healthcare services, including mental health and virtual care, to the mix. Its website now looks a lot like Ro's, Hims', and that of a bunch of other consumer health brands.

Andrew Witty, UnitedHealth's CEO, said during an earnings call in July that the online pharmacy had "just been rolled out" under Optum's pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, and would drive "a ton of access for consumers."

UnitedHealth has long been expanding into every corner of the healthcare industry. No longer just a health insurer, it has amassed a fleet of medical groups and surgery centers. It employs or contracts with more than 50,000 doctors.

Through the Optum Store, it can tap into that smaller but still lucrative market for customers paying cash for prescription drugs. Americans spent $359 billion on medicine in 2020, and patients paying without insurance spent $14 billion, IQVIA found.

Truepill, the same company handling drug fulfillment for direct-to-consumer brands such as Hims, Nurx, and Simple Health, is providing the pharmacy services for the Optum Store. Optum and Truepill already had a relationship. Optum Ventures, the company's investment arm, participated in Truepill's Series B and C funding rounds in 2020.

In an interview in August, Sid Viswanathan, Truepill's cofounder and president, told Insider that while Truepill spent its early years working with direct-to-consumer brands, it has started working with large payers such as UnitedHealth, drug manufacturers, and health systems.

"What we realized about two years ago in our company was the infrastructure that we're building in pharmacy, telehealth, and diagnostics — it's not just for digital healthcare. It applies to all of healthcare and all the incumbents," he said.

Optum's entrance into the direct-to-consumer market brings new competition to online pharmacies and telehealth providers selling their services directly to patients.

VC-backed digital pharmacies have been snatching big funding rounds and attracting new customers as more people look for convenient ways to get healthcare from home. As copayments and insurance deductibles rise, these startups are also attracting customers who have realized that they can save money on drugs and visits to the doctor by paying without insurance.

CB Insights found that funding for telepharmacy companies totaled $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021, compared with $299 million in the first half of 2020.

Ro, a $5 billion startup, raised $500 million in a Series D round in March. It's raised $876 million to date. Hims, which raised more than $300 million in funding before going public in January, reported on Wednesday that it grew revenue 70% to $60.9 million in the second quarter over the same quarter last year.

Beyond the startups, Amazon Pharmacy is selling prescription-drug discounts to cash-paying Prime customers, while Walmart has built clinics to offer primary care for low prices. It's now gearing up to provide telehealth across the country

When an analyst asked about competition from Optum during Hims' earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Andrew Dudum said a number of players are starting to move toward a direct-to-consumer model. 

"I'm excited that there are investment dollars moving into the space, because frankly a lot of people need help in this country," Dudum said. "But I think the reality is, you've got a $4 trillion market, of which I think about 80% of healthcare delivery is going to be moving toward essentially a delivery service that looks like Hims & Hers in the next 5 or 10 years. So this market is massive."

Ro declined to comment on the record.
