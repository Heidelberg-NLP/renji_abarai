Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

How To Conceal Carry Pistols And Revolvers

The recommendations here, for how to conceal carry pistols and revolvers effectively, follows experience since 2007, working with over 50 of the most common ccw handguns. That includes dozens of concealed carry holsters, and carry methods.

Those years of experience have included teaching people of all ages to handle, shoot, and carry firearms effectively and safely.

HOW TO CONCEAL CARRY CONTENTS:

But first ..........

Considerations For Carrying A Concealed Handgun

For Any Pistol Or Revolver

  • Handguns recommended will be as diverse as necessary to best accommodate the widest range of shooting and concealed carry conditions. However, “preference” is not considered in this type evaluation. 
  • Your level of initial experience will determine the extent to which the recommendations are conditional on practice.
  • Practice is primary in getting acclimated to handling, operating, firing and carrying any handgun.  Until practice has been implemented and is ongoing, none of these come “naturally”. 
  • “Comfort” is almost never perfected in concealed handgun carry. That doesn't mean you have to be miserable concealing a handgun on your body. But that shouldn't be your primary concern. It can be worked out after getting the gun you can best work and shoot.
  • Handgun carry becomes more comfortable mentally, emotionally and physically as you gain experience.
  •  If carried by prescribed methods in holsters/cases/pouches designed for concealed carry, your firearm is carried in the safest way possible. Endless analysis is not necessary. 
  • Except in the case of significant physical challenges, most semi automatic handguns can be loaded, operated and safely carried by any adult.  All require practice. 
  • For new handgun users, revolvers may be attractive because of simplicity and ease of operation. That doesn’t make them optimal for self defense for most people.
  • The double action trigger pull of a revolver is very difficult to control and shoot accurately compared to any single action or striker fired semi auto.
  • Except for those very experienced with revolvers, a semi auto firearm for primary carry is most often the best choice. 
  • A combination of a compact semi auto pistol as primary concealed carry weapon, and a small revolver for special, difficult carry situations is often the best combination.
  • While easy to conceal, the smaller, lighter and shorter that any center fire handgun is, the more difficult it is to handle, work, aim, control and shoot accurately. 

None of the above eliminates any possibility. It is to give you the basic considerations of conceal carry handgun ownership, operation, and carry.

My emphasis for your primary conceal carry guns will be based on firearms that allow a full, controllable grip, not on “pocket” guns. With these guns for self defense, the first consideration is your ability to access, grip and shoot controllably, not on comfort or convenient size. 

Calibers will be typical of the most commonly available ammo outside of any shortages due to unusual demand. 

“Compact” in handguns does not refer to very small or pocket pistols. Compact refers to guns that are slightly downsized from full duty sized. This allows the user full grip and control while the slightly smaller size allows more efficient concealed carry, and guns that fit a wide range of hand sizes.

Concealed Carry Of Striker Fired Handguns 

Suggested: Striker fired, compact, semi-automatic pistol in .40 S&W or 9mm calibers. 

Just about every major firearms manufacturer makes one or more striker fired pistols, most in a variety of shapes and configurations. The reason is simple.

These guns are generally dependable, simple to operate, accurate. They come with and without external flip up safeties, according to brand and models. 

Striker Fired Handguns for CCW

         GLOCK 23, .40S&W Caliber       

Ruger sR9c, .9mm With Flip Up Safety

The guns shown above, are typical of compact concealed carry pistols of this type. 

The G23 is a Gen. 3 model with no external safety. The Ruger SR9c is a 9mm with a flip up thumb safety. 

In most models in these calibers the 9mm and .40 frame sizes are the same. If one will fit a holster, so will the other in the same brand. They are shaped and rounded for concealed carry on body or off. 

They work, and work well for many kinds of concealed carry applications.

Compact Smith and Wesson Military and Police Handgun

Another popular compact concealed carry model handgun is this Smith and Wesson Military and Police compact. The frame size is 9mm or .40S&W. 

May be purchased with or without an external safety. 

Along with the other models above, this gives a good representation of the seemingly countless models of this type handgun on the market. 

In general, they are easy to learn, made for concealed carry, and can be counted on in case you have to defend your life with them. 

Remember, you don't have to choose one of these. You can find multitudes that will work in other brands. 

CAUTION: Having said that, this guide is to give you direction so you don't have to search forever, before getting the concealed carry gun you need to work with and carry. If you want to get started, any of these models will serve you well.

Go to a gun shop. Feel them in your hand. Work the action. Pull the trigger (with a polite request first). Then get one that feels best to you. All of them will work well. 

NOTE: Many guns that have been around for a long time, have "generations" of the same firearm manufactured prior to the current ones. You can often find those earlier manufactured generations at steep discounts compared to the latest models. And that's even though the earlier guns often perform just as well as their newer descendants. 

CCW Holsters And Carry Methods For Striker Fired Handguns

The on-body method for carrying these will be much the same as with hammer fired models. These are not recommended for ready-to-fire concealed carry outside a holster in a vehicle because of the lack of a de-cocker.

Inside the waistband holsters would be the most secure and accessible method of concealed carry for this type gun. It is also one of the easiest if you dress to allow coverage. Simple casual clothes with un-tucked shirt will do it. It can also be worn in the waistband with a casual jacket.

Pros To Striker Fired Concealed Carry Handguns: 

Striker fired concealed carry guns provide fast, simple operation, accuracy, dependability. Shapes easy to carry and easy to access. In compact or full size, they are easily accessible, and allow for the best concealed carry and self defense weapon available. 

Cons To Striker Fired Handguns For Concealed Carry

They should never be stowed in ready to fire condition, outside a holster made for the gun. Moving the gun when arriving at locations where CC is prohibited, the gun's chamber should be cleared and the gun made safe. They should never be moved casually without this process. 

 Concealed Carry Hammer Fired Pistols

Hammer fired Double/Single action semi autos with de-cocker. This would include guns like the Sig Sauer P229 in .9mm; Beretta PX4 Storm in .9mm or .40 S&W. Particularly well suited for car carry, outdoor activity, as well as on-person concealed carry.

NOTE: A “de-cocker” is a mechanism built into many semi auto handguns that allows you to make it ready to fire, then de-cock it with the mechanism.

The device is either a standalone element or integrated with the safety. It works the same either way.  This puts the gun in first shot double action mode ready to fire, but safe to handle. The gun cannot fire until the trigger is fully pulled and the hammer dropped. 

There are many good variations of this type gun from a majority of manufacturers. These are some of the best known for quality and dependability. 

Conceal Carry Holsters and Methods For Hammer Fired Semi-Auto Pistols:

*Just as with the striker fired models, an inside the waistband holster carrying this type or any semi auto handgun should work well. It will require a good leather belt and shirt that falls naturally and loosely around your waist, or a jacket. Can be worn with slacks, jeans or shorts. 

*That said, these guns can be safely handled out of the holster, after being de-cocked. They can safely be carried under a car seat or in a center console. They make excellent home defense guns because they can be safely carried in the de-cocked position, yet ready to fire with a pull of the trigger.

*Particularly well suited for car carry as well as on person concealed carry. They are also excellent for locations that prohibit concealed carry even in CCW legal states. 

The de-cocker allows safely removing and otherwise handling your gun.

[It should be noted that these brands represent “types” of handguns for this evaluation. There are other good guns. However, these are some of the best known. Sig Sauer and Beretta are known to be pricey but with the advantage of a great reputation and plenty of after market accessories available.]

In considering how to conceal carry either type pistol, it is critical to learn the difference between the double action trigger pull, single action trigger pull, and how each is activated. It’s not complicated, but a “first step” in understanding these guns. The role of the de-cocker is integral in the safe handling and carry of these firearms.  The learning curve is not huge, just necessary.
