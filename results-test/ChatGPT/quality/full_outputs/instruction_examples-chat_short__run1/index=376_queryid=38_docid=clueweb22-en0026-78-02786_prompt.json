Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Why it's best to seek advice from a marijuana doctor online

In many circumstances, family doctors are hesitant to offer medicinal cannabis because they are unaware of the possible medical benefits of treatment. Most medical schools’ curricula don’t touch the endocannabinoid system. This is where Releaf Clinics can help patients looking to Medical Marijuana for their symptoms. Our fully-licensed physicians, all of whom are registered with Medical Boards in each State we serve, have spent additional time learning about the health benefits of cannabis. They are aware of the medical problems for which it is prescribed and how it can aid such ailments. Ask as many questions as you want during your consultation! Our doctors are well-versed in the subject.

What Patients Are Saying About Releaf Clinics

Frequently Asked Questions

A medical marijuana card is an identification card issued by the state that will permit a qualified patient to buy cannabis from a licensed dispensary, possess, or cultivate cannabis for medical purposes.

Step 1: You must visit a state-licensed physician (not a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant) to obtain a physician certification.

Step 2: Apply for an identification card from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.

Step 3: Once your application is approved and you receive your identification card, purchase medical marijuana from a state-licensed dispensary.

It is 100% legal. Releaf Clinic health practitioners are licensed to practice in the state where they provide services. Our online solution complies with state telehealth legislation, and we store all of our clients’ personal information on a HIPAA-compliant database to preserve their privacy.

Each state that permits the use of medical marijuana has its own list of qualified medical conditions. Cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, and any other sickness for which marijuana gives treatment are all on the list of qualifying conditions for medicinal marijuana in most states. 

Unfortunately, we do not accept any forms of insurance. Because marijuana is still federally banned, no insurance companies will pay for medical marijuana recommendations at this time.

Releaf Clinics charges $150 for new patients and $99 for renewing patients. We also offer payment plans as well. If you have any other questions about pricing please call us at (888) 479-7736.

No. You will only be able to purchase from a state licensed dispensary.

You can upload medical records throughout the Releaf Clinics signup process if you believe they will help your doctor better assess your eligibility for medical cannabis. You’ll need your doctor’s referral, a valid government-issued I.D., a photo taken at the county’s program office, and proof of residency within your county when you apply for the state after finishing your Releaf Clinics appointment.

Yes, you can quickly and cheaply renew your medical marijuana card online through NuggMD for the same low price of $99.

Within 30 days of submitting your application, if your application is approved.
