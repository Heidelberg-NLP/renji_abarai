Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is it smarter to go to college or jump into real estate to invest full-time?

Has college in America become one of the biggest financial scams in world history? Or is it still a smart step on the path to financial security?

While college can be a great way to find your life’s passion, I also believe it ultimately should not be one of the select few options pushed upon young adults.

Of course, this opinion may be a little biased, considering I grew up uninterested in school. I was far more excited about the periods between classes. That was my time to come alive and hustle. One day, you might be buying Pokemon cards from me on your lunch break. Another day, it might be candy or CDs for sale.

How Many College Students Are Simply Following the Herd?

However, I think that I also have a unique point of view on this — an educated view that entitles me to portray the options fairly. This debate is often waged between the schools and their sales machines versus real estate elites who never went to college. Sometimes I feel like I may be one of the few who went to college but has also become a real estate entrepreneur.

I lasted 4 years in college studying for a degree that absolutely could not be applied to my everyday life. Period.

In deciding to go to college, I simply followed the herd without a second thought. That, of course, is always a mistake. Today, this is a mistake being made in every type of community in America, from the most privileged to those who have never had a family member attend college. Fortunately, during my stay in college, I found my interest in the real estate world.

College is Big Business

Obviously, I do believe certain occupations require a college degree. Few of us would want to find out our doctors or lawyers had never been to school. Yet other than that, I believe it’s a big business. From the universities’ perspective, it’s all about business. We’ve all heard of the student loan crisis — the crisis that could next cripple our economy and that is the primary reason many Millennials cannot buy homes. Yet tuition keeps going up. Thankfully, there is student “aid” and financing, right? Of course, although tuition keeps going up, students keep coming out of school to find their degree doesn’t help them get a job.

Education is important, no question about that. However, considering our ever-changing world and new technology, there are many learning options. There are options that won’t leave you with a big lump of debt for the rest of your life. College can be great. We’ve heard billionaire Peter Thiel pays people $100k to quit college and that many successful entrepreneurs have dropped out to build prosperous companies. But at the same time, the connections that are made in school can be very influential in any venture.

What’s the Right Choice for You?

So college or entrepreneurial investor? I recommend taking some time to think about it up front. What do you really want? What do you enjoy doing? What are you good at? Avoid following the herd. Think for yourself now, and choose the path that will fast track you to where you want to be and provide you an enjoyable journey there. You shouldn’t feel obligated to burn years of your life and to take on the stress of mountains of debt just to figure out something you could with a few hours of devoted thought now.
