Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should corporal punishment be reintroduced in schools? | Debate.org
  • Beating is right

    All the arguments for not bringing it back are because children are equal. Yes a person is person no matter what age, but what children don't think of is the long term. Suspension is now cool to students because everyone wants to be a cool kid now. The problem with this is the kids don't see what happens in the long term with suspension, where as a quick blow to the bottom or back with a wooden paddle would solve the problems right there and save time, and save the poor kids future instead of ruining what college they want to go to by giving them a suspension

  • The Children Need to Be Straightened Out

    Children are terrible things that create horror wherever they travel. They need something to straighten them out and it has been proven that beating children is greatly beneficial for their lives. Many may disagree but in all honesty corporal punishment benefitted all of the great leaders of the past to motivate themselves for greater causes. That is why corporal punishment should be reintroduced to schools.

  • Yes it should

    This is the only good way of disciplining children effectively and I really do think it should be allowed in school because some parents do it and yelling just isn't effective enough. If corporal punishment is reintroduced, kids will behave better. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

  • We wouldn't need corporal punishment if we lived in a perfect world.

    Children are not developed enough to take wise decisions solely on the base of good morals. They learn these by getting rewarded for good behavior and punished for negative behavior. Sadly, not all children learn this with conventional punishment, you probably have spent time with kids like these. Rude, uncivilised and completely unafraid of consequence because they are aware there is a limit to their punishment. This is why I believe corporal punishment should not only be reintroduced but allowable for teachers to instill. Afterall, they are the ones who spend the most time with these children.

  • I believe corporal punishment should be reintroduced in schools

    Children can just get put in the naughty corner or get detentions, some kids can just have that and learn, but what about those who don't respond well to that. This is teaching our kids that life is easy and that creates a brat. I believe that some students need more discipline than others and this is why. We shouldn't just beat the kids every time they do something, but we should know when we should and when we should just give them detention. Especially in what type of schools. Therefore it is also your responsibility as teachers, to know when they should be disciplined and how.
    Thank you,
    a student

  • I am a student

    I am a student, year ten, and i do believe that we should reintroduce corporal punishment. Most kids in my school are disrespectful little hooligans, and do just what they want. I for one would much prefer living among civilised kids, whom would one day not become criminals. Corporal punishment is there to scare kids into doing the right thing. And make them regret their wrong.

  • Discipline is out of our schools nowadays because of the banning of corporal punishment.

    We the prefects and the teachers know what we are suffering.I say yes to that.Even if authorities doubt it,they should reintroduce and see how magically it will work.I have tried it before and i know how it works,it is instill discipline in the children both at home and in school.

  • This means better futures

    Some may say that it will abuse and scare the children, but it is a most perfect way to stop them doing things against rules. A room where you sit and listen to teachers is not daunting for these children. A cane, whip or even enema is enough to scare the hell out of them. I personally think that if this does not go on, they will grow to be criminals.

  • Yes it should be brought back

    When I was in school, The threat of a smack or the cane was always there, Although I only got my legs slapped, I did get threatened with the cane once when I didnt do my homework, And was told by the teacher that if I wanted to see the headmaster, He was still in his office, But I didnt see him, And got let off as long as I did it for the next morning.

  • It should be reintroduced

    Corporal punishment is one of the most quick and effective ways to discipline a child who is misbehaving. Children who are misbehaving become a quick distraction to the entire learning environment and corporal punishment allows this to be dealt with in a quick and swift way. They need to learn discipline.

  • Prevent the bad behavior from happening to begin with

    They only act like that because they are not properly taught how to think, Instead their environment consists bad influences, Therefore being influenced by their surroundings as people naturally are when they are kids they will act as such. It would make sense to prevent them from experiencing the bad experiences by teaching them how to think rational and surrounding them with good influences (such as a safe, Friendly, Rational, Kid-friendly welcoming environment), Thus preventing said bad behavior from occurring to begin with.

  • Violence can not solve violence.

    If students experience violence with a paddle or any other striking method then it will teach the student that violence is the answer to solve problems. Imagine the consequences of that child becoming an adult and randomly hitting people because that was what he/she was taught at school or at home. Furthermore, It puts fear into a child's heart rather than hope. The best way to discipline a child is to reward them when they show good behavior. If they continue being bad then find other means to punish the child other than physical abuse. If you put your hands on a child then you are no better than the misbehaving child themselves.

  • Use the paddle, See the unemployment line

    Want to end up in a lawsuit? How about terminated? Loss of your teaching career? Oh, And how about even being labeled a pedophile? Any of that sound appealing? It doesn't? Then say NO to bringing that barbaric way of so called "discipline' back into schools! It was taken out of schools back in the late 1980's for a reason. We aren't about to set ourselves back as a society 30 damn years. Not exactly what you'd call progress. These old timers that want it brought back can go practice it with their spouses behind closed doors. That's where that kinky shit belongs anyway.

  • No! Nah! Nut! Nope! No way!

    No because kids don't deserve to be punished in that way. Parents decide what happens to their kids as they know what is best for their children. Children are sensitive and could be going through tough things at home. CHILDREN COULD GET HARMED AND NEVER GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN. HELLO

  • No No No

    Corporal punishment is in the past, It is a thing of the brutal unloving past. We are in a new age in which violence with children is being seen as wrong, So why would we introduce it in the very place that should be a safe, Friendly, Learning environment for our children. Corporal punishment might also introduce more emotional damage in children, Especially younger ones, Which either leads them to be more violent and less compassionate, Or maybe extremely emotionally damaged, Which might lead to extreme depression or insanity. Not good.

  • No corporal punishment

    Every human is the same as you so u should not treat them like garbage treat them like how u would treat ur friends or yourself hitting is the same as hurting ur self what if u had got hit in school well don’t take it out on us we’re all the same

  • School shouldn't be a prison.

    Corporal punishment used to be practiced in many places, Like prisons. It's use in both schools and prisons has disappeared in many places, With the exception of some school districts. Reintroducing corporal punishment to schools will lead to students being subjected to treatment that has is no longer used in prisons, Making students who have done minor things seem worse than convicts who have committed felonies.

  • Fuck the paddle

    Some kids go through shit and they act out. I believe the kids need talked to not beaten. Scaring a kid is not teaching a kid. The only person who should hit the kid is their parents. WHO TF LETS SOME RANDOM TEACHER HIT THEIR FUCKING KID. . . YOU GUYS R RETARDS. Tbh ur just gonna make the kid end up blowing up the whole fucking world. IS THAT WHAT U FUCKING WANT?
    #(yes, I am talking to the people who vote for corporal punishments in schools. )

  • Kids should not be and yes we all know they can be bad but maybe they are going through shit

    Kids are the wy they are we were all kids before and its not gonna help it might just make them worse than they are already like think about it and just know b=like maybe talking to them would help more or showing them what they can do or give them something they like

  • Hidings in School

    Fuck no. My parents gave me hidings with their hands up until around 11 years old. They smacked me once or twice at a time on my bottom when I was really naughty. Schools on the other hand, Beat children up to 18 years with a cane up to six times for stupid things like not wearing proper uniform. I think schools should never be given permission to hit other peoples' children.
