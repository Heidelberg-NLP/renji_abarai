Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Poor service
I wish I could review the shoes, but I never got them. I got an email a week after ordering that they were out of blue/gray but had black in my size for immediate shipping. After a week I called to check on the order and was told they hadn’t shipped but would do so same day. A week later I called to check again and was told they did not have my size. Obviously their inventory is not linked to their customer service. Very disappointing. I will be reluctant to order from here again

Sketches golf shoe
Good price and good shoe. I had been eyeing these shoes for a while but didn't like the price at the time. When I saw them at almost $30 less I jumped at the deal.

Shoes were fine, Service unacceptable
I was told the shoes are fine. They are comfortable and fit to size. These were a gift and service dept originally sent out shipping info so knew shoes would be on time. The day before delivery was due they sent an email saying credit card incorrect. I double checked and gave them the most current card on the order and they applied the old one. Shoes came 6 days after they were due. No apologies for their error which is not good business. I will not order from them any time soon and certainly not anything that is time sensitive.

Happy golfer
When I first ordered my shoes there was a small mixup. The staff responded quickly and took care of the situation. I was very pleased with the response and the shoes.

Comfortable From The First Fit
These Sketchers Golf shoes were very comfortable the very first time I put them on. They are stated relaxed fit, so a little bit wider but that worked great for me. I would highly recommend them for the comfort and also the performance they provide. On a negative note, the color choices are not great
