Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

1948 Wheat Penny Values - See If You Have A Valuable 1948 Penny + Rare 1948 Wheat Pennies And 1948 Error Pennies You Should Look For | U.S. Coins Guide

The 1948 Penny Value Ranges From 3 Cents To Over $10,000! See What Your 1948 Wheat Penny Is Worth

If you’ve found a 1948 penny and want to know its value, then you’ve come to the right place!

Today I’m going to talk about 1948 wheat pennies, including:

  • How much a 1948-S penny, a 1948-D penny, and a 1948 penny with no mintmark are worth
  • The most valuable 1948 penny
  • How many 1948 pennies were made
  • Which 1948 pennies are rare
  • 1948 error pennies to look for — including doubled die pennies

1948 Penny Value

So… what’s your 1948 penny worth?

Probably not as much as you had hoped, but it’s definitely worth more than face value! A typical 1948 wheat cent with moderate to heavy wear (which pretty much describes most old pennies you’ll find in pocket change) is worth 3 to 5 cents.

That’s the average value for any old 1948 wheat penny you’ll find in circulation — including a 1948-D penny from the Denver Mint and a 1948-S penny that was made in San Francisco.

TIP: If you see a 1948 wheat penny without a mintmark (that little letter under the date), then it was made at the Philadelphia Mint.

However, some 1948 pennies are worth much more. A 1948 wheat penny that is well-preserved, say in “mint” condition (or what coin collectors call uncirculated or mint state), can be worth 75 cents to $5… or more.

In fact, the most valuable 1948 penny was sold in 2012 for $10,350. This nearly perfect penny was graded Mint State 67 “Red” by Professional Coin Grading Service and encapsulated in a certified plastic “slab.”

NOTE: Slabbed coins are traded by collectors and won’t be found in circulation.

How Many 1948 Wheat Pennies Were Made?

Here’s a breakdown on how many 1948 pennies were struck at the Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco Mints:

  • 1948 penny — 317,570,000 minted
  • 1948-D penny — 172,637,500 minted
  • 1948-S penny — 81,735,000 minted

*These mintage figures are for business-strike pennies. The United States Mint did not strike proof coins for collectors in 1948. 

IMPORTANT: Do You Know The Grade Of Your Penny?

To determine the true value of your 1948 penny, you first need to know what condition (or grade) your coin is in.

Grab a coin magnifier and a copy of the U.S. Coin Grading Standards book. Then, watch this video to see how to grade coins yourself at home:


Rare 1948 Pennies

As the production figures above suggest, 1948 pennies aren’t really rare.

You might not see many of them in pocket change, but there are still millions sitting around in collections and hoards.

So, a 1948 penny is not a rare coin — but there are some unusual 1948 pennies that are scarcer than the typical 1948 Lincoln wheat cent!

Collectors of error coins and varieties will be glad to know that there are several 1948 doubled die pennies to look for:

There are also other types of 1948 penny oddities to look for, including:
