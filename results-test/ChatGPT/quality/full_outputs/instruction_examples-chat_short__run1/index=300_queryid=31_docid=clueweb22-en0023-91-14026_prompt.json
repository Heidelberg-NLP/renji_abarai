Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Obesity & Heart Disease

Overview

Obesity is a common problem in the United States. Current research suggests that one in three Americans is obese. Obesity and overweight are linked to several factors that increase ones risk for cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease and stroke):

  • High blood lipids, especially high triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol
  • High blood pressure
  • Impaired glucose tolerance or type-2 (also called adult onset) diabetes
  • Metabolic syndrome

Obesity and overweight are also linked to hypertension and an enlarged left ventricle (left ventricular hypertrophy), increasing risk for heart failure.

In addition, overweight and obesity can be related to some cancers, gallbladder disease and osteoarthritis.

Are you at increased risk?

To determine if your weight is linked to increase risk of heart disease, two measurements are used:

  • Body Mass Index (BMI)
  • Waist Circumference

Body Mass Index (BMI)

The BMI is a mathematical formula that factors a person’s height and weight in determining obesity. It may be less accurate for athletes or older persons who have lost muscle mass.

  • Underweight - Below 18.5
  • Normal - 18.5 - 24.9
  • Overweight - 25.0 - 29.9
  • Obesity 30.0 - and Above

Those who are overweight or obese and have two or more risk factors should lose weight to decrease their risk for heart disease. Use the body mass indicator below to calculate your BMI.

Waist circumference

Your waist circumference is the measurement of your waist, just above your navel. It is a good predictor of abdominal fat, a risk factor for heart disease. This risk increases with a waist measurement of over 40 inches in men and over 35 inches in women

A small decrease in weight can go a long way to decrease your risk for heart disease. Click here to learn about weight management strategies.
