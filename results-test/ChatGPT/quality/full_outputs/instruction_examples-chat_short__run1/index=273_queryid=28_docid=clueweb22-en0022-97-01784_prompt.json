You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should prostitution be legal? | Debate.org
  • The pros outweight the cons

    I'm not sure where to begin, so I'm just going to make a list.

    1. Rape would decrease.
    2. STD's are usually contracted from a non-prostitute.
    3. The fight against human trafficking could be better fought against.
    4. It could be taxed. Not exactly a pro for the client, but still.
    5. Sex is good for your health. If more people in America have sex, maybe we'd be a little less of an obese country and it may lower heart disease.
    6. More jobs.
    7. If abortion is legal, why not prostitution? I always hear the argument "It's my body..." Why doesn't it apply to this subject?
    8. People are doing it regardless of what the law says. Drugs can have a negative effect on a person, but prostitution has a very few downsides. And the downsides are only minor.
    9. There would be less sex-crimes.
    10. The government would not only be able to make money of taxed prostitution, but save on various costs to the tax-payer. Police, prison, etc...

    My boss's brother is 29 years old and still a virgin. He is so nervous around women that he screws up any potential relationship. When asked about it, he says that he doesn't really want a girlfriend anyway because...pretty much he says he's selfish. He wants to do what he wants whenever he wants, but he implies he still wants to be with a woman. Purchasing a prostitute would be perfect. A professional working girl could make him happy. (He seems miserable by the way. He's so ashamed to be a virgin.)

    I too would love to purchase a prostitute without the fear of going to jail. I am not boyfriend/husband material. But I would love to be with a beautiful woman from time to time.

  • It should be legal

    I think it should be legal because it would help reduce rapes, human trafficking, and murders. It is also a way for some people who don't have jobs to get one. It would also help to reduce the amount of gang violence because there would be no need for pimp/gang to keep the prostitute safe.

  • Freedom of Act

    People have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies. Who are we to tell others what to do ? If you're afraid your spouse would cheat on you then it's your problem, why blame the prostitutes ? And there are male prostitutes too, so this issue has nothing to do with gender. And why is it immoral ? Who gets to decide what's immoral and what's not ? No one forces no one to be a prostitute. Prostitution will be legalized as the human race gets smarter and more logical

  • Rights

    Many of the arguments against legal prostitution are from an ethical or moral perspective. On this website alone I have read "it is just wrong" many times. The American Constitution does not protect morals it protects rights. We do not have the ten commandments we have the bill of rights. If people want to sell their bodies for sex they have that right, sure it's not something I would do, but who am I to impose my standards and my morals or ethics upon them. Prostitutes should have the freedom to make money any way they want to.

  • It happens anyway; why not reduce the risk.

    Prostitution has been around since the beginning of mankind. Most anti-prostitution laws were passed over 100 years ago. It happens every day throughout the world, so why not make money off it and reduce the risk in it? It is simply two consenting adults exchanging a service for money. It should not be any more illegal than a plumber or maid. Also like plumbers, sex workers could also form work unions to gain more rights.
    There are currently 28 legal brothels in the United States, all of which are in rural counties in Nevada. They have restrictions and are government regulated. I believe that if very restricted and regulated, prostitution would be a massive industry in the US. A major problem seen in the sex industry is the motive to be a sex worker. Many are uneducated women working voluntarily to support a drug habit. I would also argue that men and women have the right to their body. If you can get an abortion, why not.
    According to the Economist.com, the international sex industry is a $20+ billion a year business I think that if there were added restrictions on age and education, prostitution would be a profitable industry. It would not only benefit the government through taxes, but also through redirecting police resources toward larger problems. Potential prostitutes should have to take a class on sex work risks, have at least an associate degree, and have no criminal record. Potential customers should have to be tested for STIs , and also not have criminal backgrounds. Sex workers should be required to use multiple forms of contraception, and have a valid license to practice prostitution. There should also be STI testing on the workers occasionally.
    Sex work is already all around us, most people just are not as offended by it. If a woman has sex with a man for money, it's prostitution. If they video tape it, it becomes legal pornography. Another example would be very wealthy men. Think of all the young women that marry old men for money. What do the women get out of it? Money. What do the men get out of it? Sex. This should be just as frowned upon as prostitution, but it's not.
    Is a 20-year-old woman marrying a 65-year-old man any different than prostitution? Other than "ethical/moral" reasons, why should it not be legalized?

  • There should be no law prohibiting sexual activity between 2 consenting adults.

    They consented. The government has no right to interfere with private matters such as sex. Again, there is no victim, does not harm anyone and it is consented. Although I am against it morally, legally, the government has no right to interfere with such matters.

  • Yes it will reduce rape victims

    It should be legalized because it would reduce crime, improve public health, increase tax revenue, help people out of poverty, get prostitutes off the streets, and allow consenting adults to make their own choices. They contend that prostitution is a victimless crime, especially in the 11 Nevada counties where it remains legal.

  • LEGALIZE!!!!!

    While prostitution is illegal in nearly every U.S. state, the practice continues today. According to Associated Content, citing data from Secret Diary of a Call Girl, nearly $14.5 billion dollars is spent on prostitution every year and more than $23 million a year is spent enforcing prostitution laws. So by making it legal to own a brothel, not to prostitute, to run a brothel would cut how much is spent on making sure that it isnt legal at all.

  • A cure for trafficking

    Prostitution cannot be curbed and the evil cannot be uprooted unless and until the govt. Organizations and various agencies research on how to stop human trafficking. However legalising is not a cure in some cases it may lead to degradation of social values. So in my opinion it should be legalized

  • It cannot be prevented

    Two adults have the right to sell services to each other, moralizing this is hypocritical and pointless. When it is illegal it becomes dirty and exploitative, the girls get beaten and have their money taken from them by pimps. They can catch diseases and don't have any rights as independent workers.
    LEGALIZE PROSTITUTION! (I'm a woman by the way.)

  • NO !

    I believe that prostitution should NOT be legal . What is wrong with you people , who say yes to this . Prositituion comes with alot of wrong . Murder, drugs , an sex . This should not even be a question . Have sex on your own time , not on the streets or in a strangers car . Keep it classy an less trashy .

  • It should not be legal!

    The moral fabric of society is already rottening! A wife already has to worry about her husband cheating...making this legal is not only wrong but immoral. If someone wants to be immoral they should have a legal right to do so. Would you want your daughter to think of this as a profession...because if it is made legal it could become as normal as working as a secretary! If a woman wants to be immoral and a man wants to be immoral then both should suffer the consequences of the law if caught!

  • View of a 16 year old girl.

    By legalizing prostitution, you are agreeing to using women and girls as merchandise. Legalizing prostitution will give people an unsafe fall-back option and decreases the incentive for post secondary education and any real employment opportunities. With prostitution comes a high risk of exposure to street crimes, as well as violence characterized by bodily harm, health hazards and mental trauma. Prostitution promotes unsafe sex, woman inequality & is overall just immoral.
