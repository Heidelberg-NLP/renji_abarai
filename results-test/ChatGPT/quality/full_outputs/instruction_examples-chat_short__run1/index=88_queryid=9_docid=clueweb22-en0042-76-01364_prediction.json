However, there are a few typos, such as \"makes\" instead of \"make\" and \"ideas\" instead of \"idea\". The arguments presented in the text are mostly well-defined and supported with reasoning and examples. However, some of the clauses are written in ambiguous terms, such as \"it helps to save money as students do not need to buy more clothes to go to school\", which might lead to confusion. The text could use more varied vocabulary and phrasing in order to improve its style of speech."
