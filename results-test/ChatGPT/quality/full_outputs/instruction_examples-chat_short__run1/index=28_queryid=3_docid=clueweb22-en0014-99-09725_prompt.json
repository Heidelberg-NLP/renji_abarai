Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is insider trading unethical? | Debate.org
  • We are all victims

    If someone profits by short selling share and pocketing the difference because they knew that the share would go up, it is immoral. If they knew because someone told them sensitive fact before they were public, then it is criminal. In the mean time the shares in you superannuation portfolio loose. Who lost in the long run?

  • Insider trading is unethical

    How fair is it to be a part of a company whose benefit of internal information is used by the decision makers for their own personal benefit. Then what is the point in having shareholders at all. The hope of an average investor is tested on the skill of the top management that take decisions. These decisions must favour and must look after the interests of all investors and not for a personal gain of the management. Hence, Insider trading is an unethical practice and definitely be checked upon.

  • Insider trading is unethical.

    The motive behind insider trading is personal gain for the insider at the cost of the company and its shareholders. It has been affecting the securities market adversely for a very long time thereby making the investors feel unsafe and insecure. It is unjust on moral grounds and is sort of fraud by the insiders.

  • Insider trading is unethical.

    Insider trading is unethical and for this reason it is illegal. Manipulating the stock market is bad for the economy and it is clearly unethical. People should not unfairly profit from insider information. Several people have gone to jail for insider trading because of it harms people who work hard for their money.

  • Yes it is unethical

    Investors are mislead into investing in a failing business. The business or corporation tells the investors that they are doing great and sales are up when actually they are down. They convince investors to invest into them. The business is lying to them. Investors should know for sure what they are investing in and if what the business is saying is actually factual. It is absolutely unethical and unfair. In the case of Enron, the heads of the corporation knew they were going down so they told all their employees and investors to invest everything they have including their 401Ks into the business. They did this as a way to get money for themselves when the business goes bankrupt. Because they lied to investors thousands of people were left with nothing to retire on or live on and the heads of Enron came out with hundreds of millions of dollars. Insider trading is unfair and unethical.

  • Yes it is.

    The biggest things that we as a people strive for is a level playing field for everyone. We want all things to be fair for each person. Insider trading is something that is the very definition of an uneven playing field. It allows a select few to benefit greatly while others don't.

  • Insider trading is unethical.

    Insider trading allows individuals to take advantage of information that is not generally known in order to earn more than everyone else. This tactic is not fair to the average investor who doesn't have insider information and uses only publicly available information to make decisions about how to select investments that may be profitable.

  • Must be assumed to be ethical until proven otherwise

    I believe we must assume an action to be ethical unless and until it is proven to be otherwise. In the case of insider trading, the primary argument in support of being unethical seems to be a lack of fairness. However, this is just a rhetorical flourish trying to appeal to our emotions. What is unfair about it? The person on the other side of the transaction has already decided to purchase/sell the equity without any interference from the insider. That person has also already determined his/her level of utility in the transaction by determining what price he/she is willing to accept for the transaction. There is no unfairness in that. Additionally, there will always be some level of asymmetry in the information each party has in the transaction (and at the very least how each person analyzes the same information). Let's use a quick example. Say a fellow employee receives a set of baseball cards for his birthday. You notice that one of them is a rare Babe Ruth worth $5K (you are a collector). He offers to sell you the cards (knowing you are a collector) for $50. Is it unethical to accept that deal? He has offered a price for the transaction that he believes maximizes his utility.

    We must be cognizant of the desire to regulate "fairness". Is it fair that a day trader focuses on a stock, learns everything she can about the stock (from public sources), and profits from that knowledge when a casual investor (who doesn't have the time to conduct the same level of research) doesn't have the same amount of information?

  • It's a market decision

    I just do not see how manipulating anything in business is wrong. Exploiting advantages, that's what drives growth. I don't understand how taking advantage of insider knowledge is any different than business as usual. A market is a market. I have never expected it to have a conscience or a heart. It's business.

  • It is an investment.

    Insider trading is not unethical because it is merely an investment option. If you want to earn more, you need to invest more. Some will claim it is unethical because it gives an unfair advantage to those who use it, but how can making an investment option be unfair? If someone is willing to pay for the information, then they should have the right to use it to increase their profits. It is an option that many know about, but some people make the choice not to use it. It is a matter of preference, but could hardly be considered unethical to decide to use it.

  • I do not think so.

    I have never used insider trading, but I heard that the person investing receives more money for his return by insider trading. I believe people have the right to invest their money any way they feel fit! What might be immoral to some may be just normal to another person. I do not believe that insider trading is immoral!
