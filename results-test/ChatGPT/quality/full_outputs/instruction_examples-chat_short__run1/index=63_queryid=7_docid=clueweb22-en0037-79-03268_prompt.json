Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Felons, convicts, criminals that’s what they are called, they are the deviants of the world but even so they are still human beings, should they have the right to elect a “new chief of the free world”? or vote on new laws?

Republicans makes it harder for ex-felons to vote” that the governor of state of Florida (Rick Scott) has “voted to roll back state wide

    However, the solution lays somewhere in between these two extremes. Even after felons have served their time in prison, we cannot assume they are willing to be law abiding citizens. Have learned from their mistakes and acquired good judgement and acceptable morals to allow them to automatically begin voting again. This is not fair to the rest of the public who rely on trustworthy, law-abiding citizens that have proven their worthiness to vote. However, denying all felons the right to vote for the remainder of their life is not reasonable either.…

    “Some say those who break the law lack the trustworthiness to make it” (Krajick). The lack of trust makes the US not give up the rights to vote to prisoners. They were trusted once and they decided to break the law and end up in jail. If they were trusted once and they took advantage they shouldn’t be trusted again. Although prisoners and ex-prisoners make part of who the United…

    States who enforce laws that take away the right to vote do not treat criminals as if they are normal U.S. citizens. All states have different voting laws for felons which comes from the constitution, however, denying a citizen the right to vote is equivalent to taking away their citizenship and it could also have a negative effect for those running for office.

    Capital punishment has been going on for centuries and in today 's society, people will question if it is unjust or morally wrong. To classify it as cruel and unusual punishment, would it be against our own constitution to continue these atrocities. The government should not have power over who gets to live and who gets to die. All humans are equal and have the right to live; it is immoral for someone to choose to end someone 's life, thus, I argue that the capital punishment is unjust and corrupt. Capital Punishment is immoral because it is taking someone 's life against their own will.…

    As a Federalist I believe the people of the United States should ratify the Constitution because we would fall to pieces without it. In Federalist paper 84 they say there is no purpose for a bill of rights because it is dangerous and unnecessary in multiple ways, such as allowing the government to gain more power than it is granted. Also in Federalist paper 51, they talk about the importance of maintaining separate branches and protecting the rights of the people. However, anti-federalists strongly disagree with these claims. There shouldn’t be a bill of rights because including a listing of rights would only make the people feel as if those are their only protected rights, which aren’t their only protected rights.…

    It 's hard to see someone you love and others like that person to have a hard time getting back into society. I understand why they are viewed like this since they did after all break a law. However, if they did the time and on top of that if they complete parole or probation, I do not see the problem in not granting this basic right every citizen owns. Breaking the law should not mean you lose the right to be an American citizen. In the future, ex-felons…

    Voting is considered one of the most important civic duties that a citizen may participate in. Initially, only wealthy white land owners could vote in this country, but as time passed more groups were granted the right to vote. Now, there is increasing debate as to whether convicted felons should be allowed the right to vote both during and after their sentencing. Many states have laws that prohibit this, but they have proved only to be detrimental to American democracy. Therefore, it is time for these states to repeal their disenfranchisement laws in the name of human rights and liberty.…
