Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

West Virginia Medical Marijuana Laws

West Virginia Medical Marijuana Laws Patients Should Know

There are several important West Virginia medical marijuana laws every patient must know. With the signing of Senate Bill SB 386, West Virginia became the 29th state to legalize medical cannabis. While this is a huge victory for advocates, it comes with some strict regulations that must be followed. Non-compliance with these medical marijuana laws in WV can result in hefty fines or even jail time.

Is Medical Marijuana Legal in West Virginia?

Cannabis is legal for qualifying patients who possess a West Virginia medical marijuana card from the Department of Health and Human Resources. In order to obtain a certification, patients must have a qualifying condition and receive a written recommendation from a state-licensed physician. Recreational marijuana use is not legal in West Virginia.

Who Qualifies for Medical Marijuana in West Virginia?

West Virginia currently has 16 qualifying conditions for medical marijuana:

  • Chronic or intractable pain
  • ALS
  • HIV/AIDS
  • Cancer
  • Huntington’s disease
  • General seizures
  • Epilepsy
  • MS
  • Crohn’s disease
  • Parkinson’s disease
  • Neuro-Bechet’s autoimmune disease
  • Neuropathies
  • Sickle cell anemia
  • PTSD

Can Gun Owners Access Medical Cannabis in West Virginia?

If you have a medical marijuana card in West Virginia, you may be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Every gun purchase requires a federal background check as dictated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

As part of this background check, every prospective gun buyer must complete a Firearms Transaction Records form, which asks (among other things), “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?”

Under federal law, all marijuana use—including medicinal use—is considered unlawful. So as a patient, you must answer “Yes” to the question above. To lie is considered perjury, an offense punishable by up to 5 years in prison. However, if you tell the truth, the dealer is prohibited from selling you a firearm.

If you have questions about your gun ownership rights as a medical marijuana patient, speak to a licensed attorney.

Can I Be Fired for Using Medical Marijuana in West Virginia?

West Virginia is one of a few states in which cannabis users enjoy some degree of protection from workplace disciplinary action. According to the West Virginia Medical Cannabis Act:

No employer may discharge, threaten, refuse to hire or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against an employee regarding an employee’s compensation, terms, conditions, location or privileges solely on the basis of such employee’s status as an individual who is certified to use medical cannabis.

However, the law further states that employers are not required to allow medical cannabis use on the business premises, nor are they required to accommodate employees who perform their job while under the influence.

So in other words, you shouldn’t be suspended, terminated, or otherwise discriminated against just because you’re a medical marijuana patient and test positive for THC on a drug test. However, aside from that, you still have to honor your company’s policies regarding workplace conduct and safety.

What Types of Marijuana Are Permitted for Patients in West Virginia?

Can Minors Qualify as Medical Marijuana Patients in West Virginia?
