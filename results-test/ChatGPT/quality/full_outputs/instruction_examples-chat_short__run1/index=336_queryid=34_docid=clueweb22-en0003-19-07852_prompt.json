Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Social Networking Site

Social networking sites (SNSs) are virtual communities where users can create individual public profiles, interact with real-life friends, and meet other people based on shared interests.

Social Networking Sites

R. Watermeyer, in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics (Second Edition), 2012

Introduction

Social networking sites (SNS) are a way for people in the offline world to stay connected regardless of geographical distance, difference in time, or other context-specific barriers. They are spaces of socialization for common communities, communities in practice, or those united by a shared interest. They have gained global popularity as a medium through which people transmit, coordinate, and, in some cases, live their lives. Powered by Web 2.0 technology, SNS are explicitly participatory, dialogical, and user-content fed. Sites such as MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are dissemination portals, showcasing in vivid multimedia ways expressions of everyday life that invite comment and discussion. They offer a continuously updating diary or inventory of the self. SNS are both product and part of an age of globalization and are at once a powerful example of social and economic interconnectivity and democratic empowerment; an unparalleled information resource and educational tool; a mechanism for identity work and cultural enterprise; and also a barometer of local, national, and international inequality and medium for illicit, criminal, and terrorist behavior.

SNS are increasingly deployed, albeit unintentionally, not only as a platform for computer-mediated communication but also as a substitute for face-to-face forms of social interaction. SNS interactions are characterized by an ease and immediacy, often nonreplicable in the offline world. Unfettered by the constraints of physical proximity, geographical setting, or time zone, SNS allow for mobile, instant, and continuous exchange. However, at the same time as they bring together, SNS may be accused of setting apart. Critics argue that SNS engender overreliability in forms of impersonal communication that reduce person-to-person physical contact and cause the deterioration of core communicative skills. This is further compounded by an overreliance on communicative technologies, particularly audiovisual interfaces that replace core skills of articulation, deliberation, and critical reasoning. Furthermore, SNS may dilute a command or incentive for creative and imaginative forms of interpersonal expression. From an epistemological perspective, it is argued that SNS enervate the potential for independent and autonomous knowledge building and the diminution of attention and concentration spans. Some critics attribute physiological changes, increased incidence of illness, and premature mortality to prolonged or excessive exposure to SNS. Although SNS are hugely popular and continuously used, they are not wholly insulated from a range of ethical issues. The promissory rhetoric that accompanies SNS as a constituent of the Web 2.0 revolution distracts from the very real and omnipresent dangers of its use and/or misapplication.

The global proliferation of SNS and SNS users (SNSers) – with highly variegated applications in multiple potential contexts – has induced an often uncritical and blind-sided acceptance and normalization of SNS as a feature or accessory of everyday life. Such is the ubiquity and integrality of the SNS to social life that it has become almost indispensable and, for the ‘Net Generation,’ a lifestyle essential. However, while exploiting the multiple attributes and conveniences of SNS, individual users and user communities may become so immersed and convinced of the online environment as to unsuspect the safety of domain infrastructure and legitimacy of information migration to other unidentified domains for unknown users. The capacity of SNS as bridging or reconciliatory devices between geographically disparate or chronologically forgotten individuals/communities epitomized by instant and efficient connectivity and the promise of global coalescence is certainly appealing. Moreover, in cultural–commercial terms, and in an age of lifestyle marketing, the SNS is a liberatory tool, emancipating individuals through open and relatively unregulated dialogue.

However, the SNSer may occupy the online domain much like a homeowner who purchases a property without a survey or certification of its structural integrity. Too many, too often, are guilty of signing a contract without consulting or verifying its conditions. By bypassing the small print of contractual obligations, the user relinquishes many of his or her powers of ownership and governance in the public dissemination and use of personal information, albeit personal information broadcast by the user of his or her own volition in an open and relatively unsecure space. It seems that SNSers display only a limited cognizance or else are unconcerned about the risk associations of SNS use. SNS use is thus simply conceptualized and nonchalantly bought into as a means for personal expression within an environment deemed to be consequence free. Few, then, would reckon upon the ways or even the possibility that their personal information might be co-opted for a variety of purposes beyond their control or wishes and by a variety of unknown agencies. Ultimately, the SNSer may unwittingly supersede his or her claims of information privacy, certainly of the sort that conflicts with personal interests or corrupts accounts of self. The great depth and spread of online networks also means that tracing or mapping the journeys and uses of personal information becomes near impossible. Aspects of self therefore are potentially lost to individual subjectivity. Furthermore, personal information may pass through so many intermediaries or knowledge brokers as to render its final iteration inconsistent and/or incomparable to its first.

Issues of self-presentation or at least the mutability of individuals’ online profiles are especially relevant given the high demand for visual content. Of course, online profiles may evolve into exaggerated or fictionalized versions of the offline self. The way with which SNSers exploit the creative license granted by SNS in generating – with good intention or innocence – superlative, alternative, or imaginary depictions of self is itself problematic where the creation of online personalities or avatars is done not innocently, playfully, or with good intention but malignantly, to the detriment or harm of others or even in ways unlawful.

The extent to which private and public realms conflate is perhaps the greatest cause for concern, particularly in the context of an information or network society.

Social Networking Addiction

Mark D. Griffiths, ... Zsolt Demetrovics, in Behavioral Addictions, 2014

Abstract

Social networking sites (SNSs) are virtual communities where users can create individual public profiles, interact with real-life friends, and meet other people based on shared interests. Anecdotal case study evidence suggests that “addiction” to social networks on the Internet may be a potential mental health problem for some users. However, the contemporary scientific literature addressing the addictive qualities of social networks on the Internet is relatively scarce. This chapter provides empirical and conceptual insight into the emerging phenomenon of addiction to SNSs by examining motivations for SNS usage, examining negative consequences of SNS usage, and exploring potential SNS addiction. The chapter also examines screening and assessment tools, and suggests tentative treatment approaches based on the treatment of other online addictions.

Social Media and Health Behavior Change

L. Laranjo, in Participatory Health Through Social Media, 2016

6.4.2.2 Use of Social Networking Sites in Promoting Health Behavior Change

SNSs [57] are now a global phenomenon. As of September 2013, 73% of online adults were using an SNS of some kind and 42% were using more than one [80,81]. Facebook is the most popular platform (with more than 1.19 billion monthly active users [82]), followed by Twitter (500 million users worldwide [83]). In parallel to general-purpose SNSs like Facebook and Twitter, health-specific SNSs are also emerging [84,85]. Some are oriented towards patients with a specific chronic condition (e.g., TuDiabetes [86,87]), others are more general and designed for patients with any chronic condition (e.g., PatientsLikeMe [88,89]), and a few others target people wanting to change a particular health risk behavior or improve their lifestyle (e.g., smoking cessation [90]).

The application of SNSs in the health domain shows tremendous potential both at the population and individual levels [91]. At the population level, they are currently being used for public health surveillance [92] for communicable [92,93] and noncommunicable diseases [86,87]. At the individual level, they are able to facilitate access to health-related information [94–97] and social support [56,90], promoting better-informed treatment decisions [88,89].

Given that lifestyle behaviors are nowadays responsible for the global burden of noncommunicable diseases [1], growing attention is focusing on how to use SNSs to counteract this trend [60,98]. Interestingly, studies of offline social networks have demonstrated the actual role of social influence in spreading certain risk behaviors such as in the case of alcohol consumption [99], smoking [59], and obesity [58].
