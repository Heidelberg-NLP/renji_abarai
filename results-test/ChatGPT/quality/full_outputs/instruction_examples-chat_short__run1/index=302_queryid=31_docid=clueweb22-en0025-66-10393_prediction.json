        "content": "This text argues that, although obesity is clearly a health threat, it does not fit the traditional definitions of a disease because it lacks a universal concomitant group of symptoms or signs and the impairment of function which characterize disease. Therefore, labeling obesity a disease is not a necessary step in a campaign to combat obesity, and may be interpreted as self-serving advocacy without a sound scientific basis. So, the text seems to suggest that obesity is not a disease."
