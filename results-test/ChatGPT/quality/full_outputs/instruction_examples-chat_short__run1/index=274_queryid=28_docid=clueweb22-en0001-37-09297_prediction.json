        "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs, but I can provide an analysis of the arguments presented in these articles:\n\nBoth articles present valid arguments, but they have different conceptions of the issue. On one hand, Rachel Moran talks about the sex trade as sexually coercive and dehumanizing for women and condemns its legalization. On the other hand, Gillian Abel argues that sex work should be considered as any other occupation and legalized to guarantee labor rights and prevent exploitation.\n\nRegarding the questions asked:\n\n- Whether prostitution should be legal or not is a matter of debate with no clear answer. The issue poses challenges around liberation vs. exploitation, individual choice vs. social responsibility, among others. \n- Denying sex workers their right to work legally can infringe upon other individual rights, such as access to legal aid, representation, or protection.\n- Legalizing sex work may reduce the criminalization of people involved in the sex trade, and allow them to claim labor rights, protection, and justice. Concerns of possible side effects should be addressed and may require complementary policies, such as those related to trafficking, healthcare, taxation or education.\n- The implementation of the \"Nordic Model\" or total criminalization only to clients is another alternative to the legalization of prostitution. It is based on the principle of equating prostitutes with victims and the clients with abusers, aiming to reduce demand by reducing the acceptability of prostitution.  However, this approach has also been criticized for not addressing the structural causes of prostitution, putting women in greater danger by driving sex work underground, and facilitating police harassment and abuse."
