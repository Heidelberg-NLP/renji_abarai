Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

The Federal Government Contract Minimum Wage Increase Is in Effect

Effective January 1, 2021, federal government contractors are required to pay their employees performing work on or in connection with covered government contracts at least $10.95 per hour – an increase of $0.15/hour from the 2020 federal minimum wage. 85 FR 53850 (Aug. 31, 2020). As we previously reported, the federal minimum wage for workers on covered government contracts has increased every year since 2015 pursuant to Executive Order 13658 (“Executive Order”) and its implementing regulation, FAR 52.222-55, Minimum Wage Under Executive Order 13658.

As a reminder, contractors with current covered contracts that will continue into 2021 should review their payroll records to see if there are any covered employees earning less than $10.95/hour. If any covered employees are earning less than this new federal minimum wage, the employer must increase those employees’ rate of pay beginning January 1, 2021. Contractors may not discharge their obligation to pay at least the new minimum wage by furnishing fringe benefits.

Additionally, contractors are responsible for their subcontractors’ compliance with the Executive Order and may be held financially liable for underpayments. As a result, contractors should remind their subcontractors of the obligation to pay their covered employees the 2021 federal minimum wage. They also should consider reviewing subcontractor certified payrolls and other payroll data for potential violations.

Requesting a Price Adjustment

Although government contractors may be required to increase wages, they may be able to recover this increase from the Government if they can warrant that the contract price does not include allowance for any contingency to cover these increased costs. FAR 52.222-55 provides that a contractor may request an adjustment to the contract price if its labor costs (including subcontractor labor costs) and any associated labor costs increase as a result of the annual increase to the federal minimum wage. Associated labor costs are the increases or decreases from changes in social security and unemployment taxes and workers’ compensation insurance and excludes any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit. Subcontractors similarly can request a price adjustment through the prime contractor.

It is important to note that the minimum wage requirements under the Executive Order are separate and distinct from the prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act (“DBA”) and Service Contract Act (“SCA”). Accordingly, contractors are not entitled to duplicate price adjustments with any price adjustment sought under the DBA or SCA. Therefore, contractors must pay the higher of: (1) the new federal minimum wage rate; (2) applicable SCA wage determination rate; or (3) applicable DBA wage determination to its covered employees.

Finally, contractors may not seek a price adjustment as a result of any wage increases under any other federal or state prevailing wage law or applicable law establishing a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage.

Beginning now, contractors should promptly determine whether they need to increase rates of payment. They also will need to determine whether they and/or their subcontractors will need to submit a request for a price adjustment to the Contracting Officer on any current covered contract.
