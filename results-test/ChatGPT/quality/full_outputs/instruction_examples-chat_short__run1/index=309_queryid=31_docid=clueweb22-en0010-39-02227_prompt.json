Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

New criteria for 'obesity disease' in Japan

New criteria for 'obesity disease' in Japan

Circ J. 2002 Nov;66(11):987-92. doi: 10.1253/circj.66.987.

Abstract

The present study was designed to establish adequate criteria for categorizing 'obesity disease' in Japan in relation to obesity-related complications. The subjects were 1,193 Japanese subjects (775 men, 418 women; age: 20-84 years old, body mass index (BMI): 14.9-56.4 kg/m(2)) including subjects undergoing a health examination and obese subjects visiting an obesity clinic. Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were determined by computed tomography (CT) at the umbilical level. Anthropometric parameters, including BMI, waist circumference (W), waist/hip circumference (W/H), ratio and waist circumference/body height (W/BH) ratio, were measured. Hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension were evaluated as obesity-related complications. The relationship between each parameter and the prevalence of the complications was investigated. The number of complications increased in accordance with BMI and the average value was greater than 1.0 at a BMI of 25. The best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for detecting subjects with multiple risk factors was a BMI of 25. BMI showed a close positive correlation with SFA (r=0.82), even for BMI > or =25 (r=0.77), but had a weaker correlation with VFA (r=0.54). The obese subjects with a BMI > or =25 had no correlation between BMI and VFA because of the wide individual variation of VFA. The number of disorders was greater than 1.0 at 100 cm(2) of VFA and the best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for determining subjects with multiple risk factors was 100 cm(2) of VFA. Between the simple anthropometric values and measurement of VFA, it was proven that W had the closest relationship with VFA in both men (r=0.68) and women (r=0.65). The regression line obtained from simple correlation analyses indicated that the W corresponding to 100 cm(2) of VFA was 84.4 cm in men and 92.5 cm in women. These data suggest that obesity is adequately specified as a BMI > or =25 in Japan where the prevalence and degree of obesity remains mild. It is reasonable to establish the cut-off point of VFA at 100 cm(2) as indicative of the risk of obesity-related disorders and a waist circumference of 85 cm in men and 90 cm in women approximates to this visceral fat mass.
