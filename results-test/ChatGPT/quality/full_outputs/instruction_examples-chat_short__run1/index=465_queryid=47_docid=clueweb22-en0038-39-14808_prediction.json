        "content": "The article presents both sides of the debate about homework very well, discussing the pros and cons of assigning homework to students. It also provides alternatives to homework, such as the Exercise Your Brain program implemented by P.S. 118, and highlights the positive feedback from parents and students alike. Overall, the article seems well written and informative, so I would say it has a high rhetorical argument quality."
