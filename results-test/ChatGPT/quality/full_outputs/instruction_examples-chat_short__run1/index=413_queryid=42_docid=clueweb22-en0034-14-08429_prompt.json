Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Blackhawks honor Troy Murray on Hockey Fights Cancer Night

Troy Murray

t was an emotional evening on Sunday at the United Center, where the Blackhawks hosted Hockey Fights Cancer Night.I

Former Blackhawks center and current radio broadcaster Troy Murray, who's battling cancer, was celebrated throughout the night in his first public appearance since the diagnosis in August. On the purple carpet event, the ceremonial puck drop, the TV and radio broadcasts, during the commercial timeouts, you name it: Chicago showered Murray with love and support.

"He's obviously been around for the whole time I've been here," Patrick Kane said. "Just a fun guy to see in the locker room and talk to about hockey and just life in general. Always got a smile on his face, positive attitude. You can see him out there tonight, he was just smiling, happy. He seems like he was grateful to be out there. It was great to see him."

Nobody can put a smile on your face quicker than Troy, which made the 2-0 loss to the San Jose Sharks sting even more.

"I wish we were able to get a win for him," Connor Murphy said. "We said it before the game, we were playing for him and for everyone battling, present and past. It's an emotional night, seeing everyone out here supporting him and supporting everyone with their signs, who they're fighting for. It's a great thing that he was able to come out today. We've all been thinking of him. He's been in our prayers for months now. It's really awesome to see his face here."

The frustrating part is that the Blackhawks did everything but win the hockey game.

Just look at the numbers:

  •   The Blackhawks had 8:14 of offensive zone possession time, according to Sportlogiq. The Sharks had 4:04.
  •   The Blackhawks set a new season-high in shot attempts (76) and scoring chances (38), according to Natural Stat Trick. They allowed only 22 shots on goal, which was their second-fewest in a game this season.
  •   The Blackhawks had an expected Goals For of 2.48. The Sharks had an expected Goals For of 2.01.

"Honestly, I think our game today was probably the best hockey game we’ve played all year for three periods," interim head coach Derek King said. "I’ll take that every night. If we play like that for three periods, I’ll take that."

It's hard to disagree, which sounds funny to say considering his team scored zero goals. But the reality is, the Blackhawks probably win this game nine out of 10 times if they replayed it.

Regardless, it was another game where the Blackhawks were trying to grind out a low-scoring win. Until they find a way to break out offensively, we might see more of that moving forward.

"It's a tough league," Kane said. "That's kind of the situation we're in with this team now. You look at the last few games, even the games we've been successful, we've found a way to get a late goal and win 1-0 or 3-2 in overtime. Looks like that's the way we're going to have to play to be successful."

While a win would've made Sunday night so much sweeter, the highlight of the day was seeing a familiar face back at the United Center in Troy Murray.

"It’s been tough not having him around, just like his smile and positive energy around," Ryan Carpenter said. "We really miss him. We’ve been thinking about him and praying for him a lot."

Fight on, TM19.
