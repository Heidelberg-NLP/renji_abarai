Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

For a right-handed person, should you put your handgun holster on your right or left hip? - Quora
8 Answers
  • For a right-handed person, should you put your handgun holster on your right or left hip?

Unless you prefer cross draw, your holster should be worn on the strong side, so you minimize the movement of your presentation. As to where you wear it that is another thing entirely. For best concealment and ease of draw, I prefer 4 o’clock. To help you figure this out, your belt buckle is 12 o’clock. That would generally put your holster between your side pocket and hip pocket, slightly closer to your hip pocket.

Depends upon you and your use and clothing.

I use different holsters for different reasons - the left hip cross draw was a go too for being a driver a lot of the time. behind the Right hip or shoulder holster for motorcycle riding, most of the time right hip at 2:30 or 4:00 o’clock position for casual

If you are standing, the holster would normally be worn in the strong side, in this case, the right side. This way the gun can be drawn and positioned more rapidly and it avoids crossing the target.

The hip carry is actually misnomer. Wearing a gun with the weight of the firearm on the ileum quickly becomes uncomfortable and can even be painful. This is why a properly worn gun belt is cinched around the waist, not the hips. This is also why it used to be common for police officers to wear Sam Browne belts with shoulder straps, which took the weight of the gun off the hip.

The classic FBI carry position, with a forward-canted holster positioned right behind the hip, where there is more “padding,” is more comfortable for carrying and the forward tilt angles the grip, making it easier to conceal.

For sitting or driving, a crossdraw holster is preferable as it keeps the gun more accessible. Properly worn, a crossdraw holster should keep the handgun grip within easy reach and be reverse-canted to allow the gun to be easily withdrawn.

Cross draw, in front of left hip is advantageous for drivers and people who will spend the majority of time sitting/ may need to draw from sitting. It is less good for standing and walking.

Directly on the hip will be uncomfortable for thinner built people such as myself. The more difference there is between how wide you are side to side vs how thick front to back, the greater the discomfort. So, just behind the right hip would be the comfy spot. For standing and walking, this is going to be more comfortable, but you'll find yourself sitting crooked and may “print” a little more.

Overall, what is comfortable for you, for your body shape, that is what is important.

Right hip so you can easily slide the gun without trying to reach for the holster on the left hip.

I don’t wear any handgun on my hip. I wear mine behind my right hip over my right hip pocket with the grip leaning forward in what’s known as an FBI cant. If you wear a gun on your hip not only can everyone in front of you see your gun, but so can the ones to the your side and behind you. Plus, if the gun’s on your hip it’s going to smack against everything you walk past.

Well, unless you’re aspiring to be a cross-draw specialist, the pistol goes on the strong side. I have a few shoulder rigs that I like, but you have to bring the firearm across your body to present them.

Right handed would use a holster on the right side, unless you’re using a small of the back or cross draw holster. Another exception would also be the shoulder holster with the firearm on the left.

This is a use-of-force (UOF) question fitted into a “what-if” scenario. An old UOF instructor I had put it this way:


> Before we dive into this important information, let me tell you about ‘what-if’s’. You can constantly throw all kinds of variations into these shoot-don’t-shoot scenarios, and we will always find exceptions. But if you’re going to stay alive and out of jail, you have to know the fundamentals!

So, in order to know the right answer to this question, lets agree on a few things:

What? Have you ever handled a gun?

Magazine release buttons like this are intended to be actuated with the thumb of your right hand.

It’s in a fairly easy position to do so, by design. Heck, my hands are big enough that I don’t even have to do that awkward twist thing to hit the release, like my buddy with stubby fingers. It’s meant to be done with one hand.

What have you been doing? Or are you accustomed to European style mag-releases on the butt that require two hands?

The only issue of the American style mag-release is that it kinda sucks for lefties, not righties.

  1. Pick it up.
  2. Tell everyone to relax.
  3. Order a better holster and spring for the rush shipping.

If law enforcement demands that your gun be removed from your person, NEVER do it yourself! If backup is inbound and arrives while you are personally removing your firearm, that backup is going to assume that you are drawing your weapon on his fellow officer, and you are 99.999% likely to be shot. In the case that the officer demands that your weapon be relinquished, you willingly comply by telling him that you are slowly raising your hands above your head and that you will follow his instructions precisely so that HE/SHE may safely remove the firearm, but that you will not be touc

If backup is inbound and arrives while you are personally removing your firearm, that backup is going to assume that you are drawing your weapon on his fellow officer, and you are 99.999% likely to be shot. In the case that the officer demands that your weapon be relinquished, you willingly comply by telling him that you are slowly raising your hands above your head and that you will follow his instructions precisely so that HE/SHE may safely remove the firearm, but that you will not be touching the weapon so as to not alarm any other incoming officers, so that everyone goes home to their loved ones. (NOTE: if you have been carrying illegally, it may be a while before you go home to your loved ones…in CA, that will be many years).

EDIT TO ADD: there have been a few folks who have commented that you are legally bound to follow the orders of a LEO, including removing your firearm. While it is true that you are bound to follow orders, it is also true that if your hand touches your firearm while another uninformed officer is arriving on scene (he does not know you’ve been ordered to remove your firearm), then you are going to be dead. Respectfully, I apologize in advance to those who think removing one’s own firearm is a good course of action, my training has taught be otherwise, and logic also dictates otherwise. Therefore, I will be removing any comment that indicates you should follow the order to remove the firearm yourself. I realize that this is your opinion, but I cannot, in good conscience, allow comments like that to potentially result in harm to others. It is YOUR choice to personally do what you think is right, remove the firearm or ask the LEO to remove it.

Please, if the officer asks you to disarm yourself, keep your hands in plain view of the officer, and respectfully and for your own safety, ask something like “so that I am able to safely return to my family tonight, would YOU please remove the firearm from my person? It is a (weapon model) located on my (weapon location). I would like to keep my hands safely in your view and in the view of any other arriving officers so that you all also feel safe. How would you like to proceed?”

Signs are more likely to simply prohibit guns or weapons and not mention concealed or not.
