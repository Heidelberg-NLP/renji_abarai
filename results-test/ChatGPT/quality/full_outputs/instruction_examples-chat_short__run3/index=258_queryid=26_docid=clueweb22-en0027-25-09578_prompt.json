Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

New Scientific Statement Seeks to Standardize Cardiac Surgery Trials

With unique challenges, RCTs in cardiac surgery need to take into account deliverability to change practice, says Mario Gaudino.

New Scientific Statement Seeks to Standardize Cardiac Surgery Trials

In an effort to bolster the level of evidence produced by randomized clinical trials in cardiac surgery, a new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) outlines specific methodological challenges and offers solutions.

“Randomized trials are the highest level of evidence—they inform practice, but most importantly, they affect patient outcomes,” lead author Mario Gaudino, MD, PhD (Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY), told TCTMD. “However, randomized trials in surgery, and in cardiac surgery in particular, face unique challenges compared to drug trials.”

While pharmaceutical trials compare “pill a versus pill b,” surgical trial outcomes can be affected by the experience and preferences of each individual operator involved—what Gaudino termed the “surgeon effect.”

“We’ve seen in the past examples of important large trials that, in the end, were not able to provide the answer they were supposed to provide because of methodological issues and because of the lack of attention to the details such as . . . deliverability,” Gaudino said, although he declined to provide examples.

To prevent this from happening in the future, this statement, sponsored by the AHA and published this week in Circulation, provides guidance around standardizing processes so that trial outcomes can not only reliably change practice but can also be pooled with those from other trials in larger meta-analyses. Of note, the document was generated by the AHA’s surgical council and did not involve the major surgical societies. Joint documents, said Gaudino, are “very complicated” and take more time to pull together.

Timing of conducting surgical trials is also critically important, according to Gaudino. “It's complicated because surgical technique tends to evolve with time; it is initially described then subsequently modified to make them better and better,” he said. “So if you do your trial too early after the introduction of the procedure, the procedure may not be mature [enough] to be tested. But then if you wait too much, you take the risk that the community adopts the procedure even in absence of solid data to a point that then there is no equipoise of a trial comparing it to the old standard of care because nobody is using the old standard of care anymore.”

The document also addresses quality-of-life and patient-reported outcomes “that are kind of neglected in surgical trials, but I think they are very important,” Gaudino said.

Gaudino said he expects this statement, the first of its kind, to be updated as approaches to clinical trials continue to change. “The pandemic has really accelerated the use of new trial design, looking at platform trials [for example],” he said. “So, it is possible that in the future, in a few years, there will be more to be said.”

Going forward, Gaudino said he would like to not only see cardiac surgeons performing more RCTs but also see them using this document as a “guidebook” to make future trials even better.
