Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is College Worth It?

Is a degree still worth the time and money necessary? Do employers value a college education as much as they once did? Read on to see if a university degree is a smart investment for you.

 

THE NEW MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYMENT

Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based labor analytics firm, found that employers are increasingly use the bachelor's degree credential as a rule of thumb for recruiting employees.

The firm’s report, "Moving the Goalposts: How Demand for a Bachelor’s Degree is Reshaping the Workforce,” said, “Credential inflation [requiring a post-high school degree] is affecting a wide range of jobs from executive assistants to construction supervisors.” Economists refer to this trend as "degree inflation," and it is becoming more common in America's job market.

PROTECTION IN TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES

Economies rise and fall, but whatever the financial climate, both national and international businesses need educated employees. Data derived from a reportfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms the numbers — in 2013, those with high school degrees had an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent, in contrast to those with bachelor’s degrees, with an unemployment rate of 4 percent.

FACTOR IN LONG-TERM EARNING POTENTIAL

According to a paper published in the journal Science, while college is a significant investment, over the long run, college is “cheaper than free.” The study states that not going to college will cost you about $500,000 over your lifetime — after deducting tuition costs.

Another study by the Pew Research Center, titled “The Rising Cost of Not Going to College,” shows that the earning gap between those with and without a college degree is the widest it’s been in 50 years. The study also states that college graduates, regardless of generation, earn more than those without a degree.

OVERALL FULFILLMENT

Since most people spend roughly a third of their time working, job satisfaction may improve the quality of life. For almost all of us, it's necessary to have a job. What a degree can do is help you find a career that fulfills you personally.

Degree-holders have the freedom to work in industries of their choice by combining personal passions with professional skills. If you’re not sure which direction to take, click here for help with deciding which career is best for you.
