Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Last October, Fox Sports announced that one of the network’s marquee hires, former Golf Channel Morning Drive host Holly Sonders, would no longer be a part of its golf broadcasts.

In the nearly five months since the announcement, Sonders has been contributing to the network’s NFL coverage and recently announced an upcoming project with the NFL Network.

Sonders also co-hosts 18 Holes, a golf destination show, alongside Natalie Gulbis and Jimmy Hanlin.

In an interview with Golfweek, Sonders reflected on the turn her career has taken.

“The golf at Fox just didn’t turn out to be what we thought it would be,” she said. “We hoped we would get more PGA Tour rights, and it just didn’t end up happening. But I wanted to be in the studio and show my personality. It’s what I like to do, make people smile and think and bring the best out of my co-host. There’s nothing like walking out of a studio knowing you kicked ass. And then there are a million projects that are on the table that are more entertainment and fun, so I’m kind of in that world too, and that’s been really good.”

Sonders was the face of Fox golf when the network took the helm for the USGA’s championship boradcasts in 2015. She suffered an embarrassing on-air gaffe when, in the aftermath of his dramatic victory, she asked Jordan Spieth whether he had packed an additional outfit for a potential Monday playoff.

While Fox took a lot of criticism following its U.S. Open broadcast debut, the network has been open about the areas that could be improved upon (high-profile hire Greg Norman was dismissed after just one year on the job) and its commitment to learning from past mistakes to be better each year.

Sonders, though, isn’t ruling out a return to golf.

“We never say never,” she told Golfweek. “Golf is still a part of who I am and what got me here.”
