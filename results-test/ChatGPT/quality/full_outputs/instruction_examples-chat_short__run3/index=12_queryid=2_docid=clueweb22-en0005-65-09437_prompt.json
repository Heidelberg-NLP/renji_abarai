Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

    Define safe.;)

    It's unlikely that anything will blow up. On the other hand, it really isn't good for the battery, which is why most manufacturers say something like "Our product is capable of pass-through charging, but you shouldn't use this feature."

    Vaping tends to take more current than the charger supplies so the current for your vape comes from the battery, not the charger. That means the battery is charging for a few minutes, discharging for 3 seconds, charging for 90 s, discharging for 4 s, charging for whatever... It's not a safe or healthy process for the battery. If there's anything wrong with the battery, this stressful process could trigger a serious problem. Of course, it's not likely that anything is wrong with the battery.

    Short version: It will usually shorten the battery's life, but not in an exciting way.

    I tend to agree with @Hawise It's probably not good, but it also probably isn't going to blow up. I will add questions like this are part of the reason I don't use fixed battery mods.

    Read a post a long time ago that pass-through use is not a good idea. Something about it causes the plus and negative ends of the battery to heat up out of proportion with the middle of the battery causing a unstable state. Same was said about grabbing freshly charged batteries out of the charger and using them. You need the give the battery time to reach oneness with the chemical/temperature Zen after recharging. Perhaps Mooch or someone with more battery knowledge than me can shed some more light on the subject.

    If you have more than one device there really isn't a good reason to use pass through charging. Maybe if you are out and about longer than expected would be the only reason I could think of.

    Batteries get warmer when they are charging and when they are discharging. Slower charging and discharging mean less heat. I vape at higher resistance and lower power compared too what's fashionable which helps minimize battery temperatures (1.3 ohm, 380F max temp, and 16-20 max watts). If the fire button is pressed while my devices are charging my understanding is the recharging process is stopped until the fire button is released but the battery will get warmer than if you do only one or the other. Never the less I almost always charge on-board, don't hesitate to use a mod that's cconnected to a charging cable and never see the battery go past slightly warm.

    If I was vaping at very high watts, near or past the rated amp limit of the battery, may be I'd only reccharge in an exterenal charger inside of a 55 gallon drum in the backyard. Pushing the limits complicates things.

    Welcome @anthra_X !

    Since a Stick V8 kit can be had for $30-$35, a simple solution would be to pick up a second one. Backups are always a good idea and a second tank is great for changing flavors on the fly!

    Better yet, if you are like me (I can suck down the charge on the stick faster then the other can charge :w00t:), look into a mod with external batteries you can just swap out when needed. More up front cost now, but benefits quickly "pay you back!"

    I have heard "yes" and "no" but I don't like to vape personally via passthrough, even if a manufacturer states that you can. Like others, I agree it will likely put stress on the battery over time, if done consistently. I'd say you could probably do it in a pinch without any kind of explosion, but it's a habit I don't need, since I have some mod backups. I have a few "USB" charge batteries, a couple I really like, and I do find them useful on occasion. I also will only use a wall wart for charging as if something goes wrong, I don't want it affecting my computer. I also ordered a magnetic charger to cut down on wear and tear on my USB mods (and my phone, which is elderly, and starting to show wear and tear on the USB port.

    So, it's not exactly "unsafe" it's just best practice. If you really like your smok stick there is little reason not to get a backup and swap them out, and it is probably good for your battery to "rest" some between charges.

    If you want to go external battery especially if you like a higher wattage vape, looking at external battery mods is certainly not a bad idea either. :)

    Vaping while charging also puts a lot of stress on the charging port from the cable moving around. Those aren't very sturdy and, if they break, you won't be able to charge it at all.

    Welcome and glad you joined.
    Good question, Smok has not defined the pass through parameters.
    Would contact Smok and ask:
