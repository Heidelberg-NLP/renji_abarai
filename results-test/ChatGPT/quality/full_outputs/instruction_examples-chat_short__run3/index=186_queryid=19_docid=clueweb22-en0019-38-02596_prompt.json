Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Gay Marriage is Legal in Colorado

Gay Marriage is Legal in Colorado

Yesterday, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers paved the way for the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This has been a long fought battle for marriage equality; in 2006, Colorado passed Amendment 43 which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. In 2010, the 10 th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Utah's ban on gay marriage, and many County Clerks began issuing same-sex marriage licenses in Colorado. Mr. Suthers sued the County Clerks who issued the licenses in a response to the stay on the 10 th Circuits ruling as an appeal was pending.

Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States turned away appeals from five states which were requesting to prohibit same-sex marriage. In essence, this ended the stays on issuing same-sex marriage licenses for those states that were awaiting appeal decisions. This led the Colorado Attorney General to issue the following statement, "There are no remaining legal requirements that prevent same-sex couples from legally marrying in Colorado. Beginning today, Colorado's 64 county clerks are legally required to issue licenses to same-sex couples who request them. In addition, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is required to register such marriages in the records of the state of Colorado." County Clerks in Pueblo and Larimer counties began issuing same-sex marriage licenses hours after the Supreme Court denied review. In support of this move, Mr. Suthers has stated that he will no longer defend Colorado's Amendment 43.

With the actions by the Supreme Court, 30 states and the District of Columbia now have legalized same-sex marriage. Six more states are up for grabs as the 6 th and 9 th Circuit Courts have the same issue on their dockets. However, there are many other states that ban same-sex marriage and the refusal by the Supreme Court to hear the issue means that same-sex marriages still have an indefinite future.

The issues of marriage and divorce are complicated - ones that have significant impacts on a person's life, family, and well-being. If you are experiencing legal difficulties with your family life, you should contact a knowledgeable and experienced attorney who can guide you through those difficult times.
