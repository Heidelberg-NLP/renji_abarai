Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Abortion Be Legal or Illegal

Should+Abortion+Be+Legal+or+Illegal

Melani Paiva Miranda, Writer

Abortion has been an issue for many discussions for quite some time now. The debate over whether abortion should be allowed or illegal has resulted in or may result in deaths and even violent conflicts. Today, a 59% majority of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 39% think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. The numbers haven’t changed much, the majority of the people still believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

 

Abortion topics harm vulnerable women 

Most of the women have a mindset of “My body My choice.” There are many obstacles to why the majority of women believe abortion should be legal. Whether it is because they can not financially take care of a kid or if it wasn’t a pregnancy that they wanted to happen. It’s very frustrating for women who believe abortion should be legal because all of them have their own reasons for why they need to abort. Low-income women, young women, and women of color are disproportionately affected by abortion restrictions. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 75% of abortion patients in the United States are poor or low-income. Sixty percent are in their twenties. While whites make up 39% of abortion patients in the United States, blacks make up 28%, Hispanics make up 25%, and Asian/Pacific Islanders make up 6%. Furthermore, these populations face health disparities as a result of social, economic, and environmental variables, all of which contribute to healthcare access hurdles.

 

Debates between them

On the other hand, people think it should be illegal because even if it’s a small fetus it’s still going to grow up into a human, the other percent of people who believe it should be illegal determine that by their feelings. In the main debate, the illegal side always says,  “why to participate in sexual activities if you can’t accept the consequences after.” To which the legal side replies with, “it’s not always something planned, pregnancy can also happen due to rape why  should a young girl or a woman have to take care of a kid they never had planned or had intentions to it.” Due to many factors of abortion, the United States still doesn’t know if it should be illegal or legal.
