Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Free Appropriate Public Education

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigation Jump to search

The right to a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) is an educational entitlement of all students in the United States who are identified as having a disability, guaranteed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973[1][2] and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).[3]

FAPE is a civil right rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires schools to provide students with disabilities special education and related services, at public expense, designed to prepare those students for the future.[4][5] The right to FAPE was developed via various statutes as well as case law, and its implementation has evolved over the years. FAPE is offered to students through the IEP and/or 504 process.

Basics[edit]

FAPE is a civil right rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which includes the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses.

FAPE is defined in 7 CFR 15b.22 as "the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based on adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements" specified for one's educational setting with regard to one's evaluation, placement, and procedural safeguards.[6] In the U.S. Code, FAPE is defined as an educational program and related services that are individualized to a specific student and meet the standards established by the state, provided at public expense and without charge.[4]

To provide FAPE to a student, schools must provide students with an education, including specialized instruction and related services where necessary, designed to prepare the child for "further education, employment, and independent living."[5]

History[edit]

Underpinnings[edit]

Various laws began to carve out space for a student's right to FAPE in the mid-to-late twentieth century. For example, the 1958 Captioned Films Act, Public Law 85-905,[7][8] was intended, at least in part, to enrich the educational experience of the deaf, demonstrating recognition that their educational opportunities differed somewhat from their hearing peers. Further, the Training of Professional Personnel Act of 1959, Public Law 86-158,[9] increased the types and amount of training individuals received in learning how to educate students deemed "mentally retarded" (though the preferred term is now students with intellectual and developmental disabilities).[10] In addition, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Public Law 89–10,[11] as originally enacted in 1965 and amended that same year via Public Law 89-313,[12] gave states grant assistance for educating students with disabilities.[10]

Case law in the lower federal courts, i.e., at the district court level, began to move in a similar direction. In the 1972 case Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (PARC) v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,[13] the court decided that a state could not deny, delay, or end any intellectually disabled student's access to a public education.[14] The decision was reached after the Pennsylvania Board of Education, thirteen school districts, and the state's secretaries of education and public welfare sued the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.[13] The opinion asserted that education should be viewed as a continuous process, focused not only on academics, but also on teaching students how to manage their surroundings.

Similarly, in Mills v. Board of Education of District of Columbia,[15] a case decided the same year, a group of students labeled "mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed or hyperactive" by D.C. public schools filed a civil action suit against them after being denied admission without due process under Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[16] The court condemned the school's decision and declared that all children in D.C., regardless of any physical, mental, or emotional disabilities, are entitled to a free and appropriate public education.[17] Yet these precursors of FAPE were just the beginning of the trend.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973[edit]

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 established non-discrimination requirements for federal agencies as well as state and local programs receiving federal assistance. The Act does not directly bar discrimination by individuals (as does the Americans with Disabilities Act, infra) but focuses its efforts on discrimination by the state and local recipients of federal assistance. Section 504 states that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service."[18]

As a result, state public education programs became subject to federal non-discrimination requirements. However, Section 504 only requires that the school in question develop a "plan" (often called a "504 Plan") for the child, unlike an Individualized Education Program, or IEP, which tends to generate a more in-depth, actionable document.[19] IEPs can include specialized instruction and related services, whereas 504 Plans only offer accommodations.[19] Generally, more students qualify for 504 Plans than IEPs, as the bar is lower and less specific.[19]

Education for All Handicapped Children Act[edit]

In 1975 Congress passed Public Law 94-142,[20] also known as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which outlined that public schools should provide all students with an education appropriate for their unique needs at public expense (i.e., FAPE).[21]

Public Law 94-142 also included that:

  • The rights of students and their parents are protected by the law, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[20]
  • Students and their educational rights holders (almost always their families) are entitled to due process (including access to judicial review to determine that other parties have complied with their obligations) and notice.[20]
  • Schools are required to find students with disabilities within their jurisdiction and refer those students for services (often called "child find" obligations).[20][21][22]
  • Students are entitled to assessments to determine whether they have disabilities.[20]
  • Students with disabilities must have Individualized Education Plans, or IEPs.[20]
  • An IEP should be "reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits," e.g., achieving passing marks and grade advancement.[20]
  • Parents have a right to participate in the creation of their student's IEP, including but not limited to being present at IEP meetings.[20]
  • Students with disabilities should receive instruction in the "least restrictive environment" (LRE), ideally along with non-disabled peers where possible.[20]
  • Congress funds up to 40% of excess costs of educating students with disabilities.[20]

Public Law 94-142 has been amended and reauthorized several times since 1975. In 1986, it was amended to Public Law 99-457.[23] The 1990 Amendment, Public Law 101–476,[24] renamed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.[24]

Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)[edit]

The 1997 amendments of Public Law 105-17[25] extended the LRE requirements to assure all students access to the general education curriculum and required that assistive technology devices and services be considered (though not necessarily included) for every IEP.[25]

The 2004 amendment, Public Law 108–446,[26] focused on providing transition services for individuals with disabilities moving on from their school. The amendments articulate that transition services should look into connecting the students to appropriate employment opportunities and/or community resources.[26] It also outlined that IEPs should have both short- and long-term goals and created legal framework for student discipline.[26] Public Law 108-446 included information on teacher credentialing, i.e., so that they may be considered "highly qualified."[26][27] In providing FAPE, Public Law 108-446 also clarified that states also need to set targets for their students to meet and failure to do so brings federal sanctions, such as loss of funds.[26][28]

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)[edit]

Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by state and local governmental entities, including public school districts.[29] Title III of the ADA also prohibits discrimination against students with disabilities in private schools that are considered public accommodations.[30]

While private schools are not required to provide FAPE to students with disabilities (as by definition a private school does not provide a public education), under the ADA they must take reasonable steps to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their private educational program.[30] Many times this means changes to school rules, such as letting a student to carry a cell phone, permitting the use of tape recorders or laptop computers in class, or allowing a student extra time to walk between classrooms.[30] A school might also provide auxiliary aids and services such as computer-aided transcription services, assistive listening devices for auditorium-based lectures, closed captioned decoders, open and closed captioning, TDDs, and videotext displays.[30]
