Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Buffalo Police Department releases body camera policy

Posted at 12:33 PM, Jan 02, 2019
and last updated 3:18 PM, Jan 02, 2019

On Wednesday afternoon, Buffalo Police released their new policy for police wearing body cameras while on duty. The full policy is below from the City of Buffalo website.

Buffalo Police Department

Body-Worn Camera Policy

I. Purpose

The Buffalo Police Department ("BPD") is undertaking a Body-Worn Camera ("BWC") Program. The intent of this program is to equip our officers with video and audio recording devices to: (1) document police interactions with the public; (2) to capture and maintain records of crimes in progress for evidence in court; (3) to document police response during the discovery of evidence, investigation into crimes, or calls for service by the public; (4) to improve community relations and transparency; (5) to mitigate potentially confrontational interactions between the police and public through presence of the BWC; (6) to prevent and better resolve complaints made against officers; and (7) to serve in training.

Through this program the BPD hopes to foster a relationship of mutual respect between our officers and the communities in which we serve. The BPD understands that this technology does not solve all challenges that law enforcement and the community face, but it is our hope that this program continues to build on the trust we have worked to build within our community.

This policy covers recording, storing, retaining, releasing, and maintaining data from BWCs.

II. Definitions

A. Agency Administrator – A person chosen from the rank of Lieutenant or higher who is appointed by the Commissioner of Police and has full access to and user rights within the data storage system. He or she can assign and track equipment, control passwords, oversee needed repairs, delete non-evidentiary recordings, conduct audits and quality control reviews and act as a liaison with BWC representatives.

B. Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) – Small video cameras, typically attached to an officer's clothing or helmet that maximizes the camera's ability to capture video and audio data.

C. Footage/Video/Recording – All-encompassing terms to include audio, video, images, data, and metadata recorded by BWCs.

III. Policy and Procedures

A. Use of Devices by Officers

1. All uniformed police officers assigned to the "Patrol Division," "SWAT Division," "Traffic Division," and any other unit with significant interaction with the public, and any other unit that the Commissioner of Police believes is necessary, shall be equipped with BWCs above the midline of their torso, and in a position designed to produce an effective recording. The BWC manufacturer should recommend where the optimal location for the BWC is on an officer's uniform.

2. BPD officers shall only use BWCs issued by the department, and shall not use any home recording devices during their shift.

3. All BPD officers shall be trained on the use of BWCs before being issued or using a device. This training shall be conducted and developed by the Agency Administrator, with the help of representatives from the company that the BWCs are purchased from.

4. BWCs should be used with reasonable care to ensure functionality. Equipment malfunctions or missing equipment should be brought to the officer's supervisor as soon as possible. Officers shall inspect and test the BWC's functionality prior to the beginning of each shift.

5. Officers shall ensure that their assigned BWC is put into a charging unit at the end of their shift.

6. When the BWC is inoperable, it shall be exchanged for an operable unit as soon as possible. If there is no staff working who is able to do this, then the malfunction shall be noted on form P-1375 and transmitted to the Agency Administrator prior to the end of that officer's shift.

B. Recording Procedures

1. Activation – BPD officers who are issued BWCs shall activate the device during the following situations: any call for service; any traffic stop; during the execution of a search or arrest warrant; during any other arrest or custodial stop; while conducting investigatory activities including any search of a person, vehicle, or real property; during a pursuit whether they are on foot or in a vehicle; while conducting traffic control duties; while assigned to a protest or crowd control; during a confrontational or adversarial contact with a citizen; at the request of any civilian; or any other situation as determined necessary by the Commissioner or the Agency Administrator.

2. Deactivation – Once the BWC is turned on, it should not be turned off until the initial incident that caused the devise to be turned on, which can be seen in Section III(B)(1) of this policy, has been stabilized, upon the request of a victim, or as ordered by a supervisor. The event is stabilized when the event has concluded, a victim or witness has left, all persons stopped were released, or when a person arrested has been transferred to the detention facility or police station and is completely in the custody of another officer.

a. When deactivating a BWC, the officer should state on the recording the reason the BWC is being turned off, when is safe to do so.

3. Officers should make an effort to inform citizens and suspects that they are recording the interaction.

4. Officers should ask for on-camera consent to record from crime victims, .

4. Non-recording

a. During any of the situations outlined in Sec. III(B)(1) of this policy, an officer is not required to turn on the BWC if (1) the officer or another person is in immediate danger and turning the BWC on is impractical, (2) turning the BWC on would be impractical and create a tactical disadvantage to the officer, (3) when activating would delay an officer's response to the safety needs of a citizen or a fellow officer, (4) or if a BWC malfunctions. In any of these situations, an officer shall activate the BWC at the first reasonably safe opportunity to do so and explain why there was a delay in activation.

b. Certain situations should not be recorded due to their sensitive or confidential nature. This includes the following:

1. Conversations with confidential informants or undercover officers.

2. Conversations with all law enforcement personnel discussing tactics or strategy.

3. Areas where special privacy concern exists, such as rest rooms, locker rooms, places of worship, hospitals, detoxification facilities, or other medical facilities.

4. In police buildings, or the non-enforcement activities of other officers.

5. Conversations with potential witnesses who ask to remain anonymous or confidential.

6. Conversations with a victim or witness that requests to not be recorded.

7. When explosives may be present.

8. Working with sexual assault survivors.

9. Working with juvenile victims or witnesses.

c. Reporting

1. If an officer fails to activate a BWC, chooses to terminate the BWC recording, or the BWC malfunctions, the officer must fill out a P-1375 form articulating why the officer failed to activate the BWC, why the recording was interrupted, why the recording was terminated, or explaining the malfunction.

2. The P-1375 must be filled out at the end of the officer's shift and given to their supervisor. The supervisor will review all P-1375 forms and forward the information to the Agency Administrator.

C. Download Procedures

1. Every officer assigned a BWC will follow the downloading procedures created and published by the Agency Administrator at the end of every shift. If the data is not downloaded, an officer must explain why on a P-1375 form.

2. All BWC data relating to a criminal incident shall be treated as evidence and will be handled through procedures created and published by the Agency Administrator.

3. An officer may request records of an incident to be retained for a longer period of time, by filing out a request on the P-1375 form, and can be approved by the Agency Administrator.

4. All data recorded by a BWC is property of the BPD. Officers may not copy, publish, share, or disseminate any audio, video, image, data, or Meta data to anyone.

5. Officers shall not have access to edit, delete, or alter any video or audio captured by the BWC. Logs of any attempt to view, edit, delete, or alter any recording shall be kept.

IV. BWC Video Retention

A. BWC recordings should be retained by the Department or an authorized agent thereof on conditions and terms as set forth by the department, for a minimum of six months.

B. If a recording is determined to be evidentiary by the Agency Administrator, Commissioner, or a BPD officer and is needed beyond the six month period, that file should be held until the District Attorney's office authorizes the removal of the video from our storage system.

C. Any recording that is subject to an Internal Affairs, District Attorney, or Attorney General Investigation, or has the potential to be the subject of future litigation, a copy shall be retained indefinitely. At the conclusion of the investigation or litigation, the video may be removed from the server by the Agency Administrator.

D. Any video which is the subject of a civilian complaint shall be kept until the resolution of the complaint or for at least 5 years, whichever is longer.

E. Any video requested to be kept by an officer shall be kept for 5 years from the date of the incident.

F. Any video associated with a Blue Team Report shall be kept for up to 5 years from the incident.

V. BWC Access

A. Permitted Review of Footage

1. Officers will be permitted to review only footage of an incident in which they were involved for the purposes of:

a. Conducting a criminal investigation.

b. Preparing for courtroom testimony or a meeting with the Corporation Counsel's Office or the District Attorney.

c. Providing testimony pursuant to an administrative inquiry.
