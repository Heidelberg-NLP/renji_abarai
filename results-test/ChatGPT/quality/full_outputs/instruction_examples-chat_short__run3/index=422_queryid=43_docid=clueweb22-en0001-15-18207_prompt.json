Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

The Cape Cod Bottle Ban

Kennedy Ryan | 8/24/2021

On September 1, 2021, single-use plastic water bottles will no longer be sold in 7 of the 15 Barnstable County towns including Brewster, Eastham, Falmouth, Harwich, Orleans, Provincetown, and Wellfleet.

According to Sustainable Practices, a Barnstable County-focused environmental action group, over 1,500 single-use plastic water bottles are used and discarded every second. While it’s better to recycle single-use plastic bottles than throw them in the trash, refusing them altogether has become the top priority.

Back in June of 2021, all 15 Cape Cod towns instituted a Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban, which eliminated the purchase of single-use plastic beverages by town governments and prohibited the sale on town properties. In addition, 10 of these towns have now adopted a Commercial Plastic Bottle Ban, prohibiting the sale of single-use plastic water bottles by in town retailers. Beginning in September of 2021, the water bottles will no longer be sold in Brewster, Eastham, Falmouth, Harwich, Orleans, Provincetown, and Wellfleet with the towns of Chatham, Dennis, and Sandwich soon following suit in later months.

As a result of this, Cape Cod has the most municipalities enacting the ban in the country, becoming the leader in this green initiative nationwide.

To learn more about The Cape Plastic Bottle Ban, please visit Sustainable Practices.

Visitors should pack reusable water bottles for their trip or plan to purchase a reusable bottle at one of the many retailers throughout the Cape.

Not sure where to refill your bottle? Findtap.com is a great tool to find refill stations. Simply enter your vacation zip code, and the website will provide nearby locations. Users can also add refill stations that aren’t listed to improve the website list. This website is providing a valuable resource to the community.

Many of the rentals listed on WeNeedaVacation.com include water filters. To find these homes, please select “Filtered Water” under our Green Amenities section.

This initiative will reduce waste and lower Cape Cod’s carbon footprint, making the Cape a national leader for green initiatives.
