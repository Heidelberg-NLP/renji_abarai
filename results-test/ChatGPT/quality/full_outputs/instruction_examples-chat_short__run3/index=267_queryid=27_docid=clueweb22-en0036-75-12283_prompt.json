Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Oxford High School shooting

Maybe time really is a flat circle, because here we are again. Another broken kid — who had raised red flags and alarmed everyone around him — got his hands on a gun and opened fire in his school, killing and wounding people that his sad, damaged psyche had concluded had somehow wronged him.

As if on cue, all of the same familiar faces took the opportunity to blame gun rights supporters — including, of course the NRA — and claim that the Oxford High School shooting is the latest evidence that America needs more gun control laws to stop horrors such as these from happening.

It’s obvious, right? All we need are more laws passed by more courageous legislators to keep the Adam Lanzas, Nikolas Cruzes and Ethan Crumbleys of the world from doing the terrible things that they do. Then we can all sleep soundly.

That is, of course, a lie.

It’s a lie because everything those three shooters and the other deranged psychopaths before them did was already in direct contravention of dozens of laws that have been on the books for decades. As he’s the most recent, let’s count some of the laws that young Master Crumbley totally disregarded when he opened fire.

Assuming he didn’t have permission to take it that day, Crumbley stole his father’s newly-purchased gun. The 15-year-old then took it to school, breaking Michigan’s illegal possession and concealed carry laws. As soon as he got to Oxford High School, he then broke the federal Gun-Free School Zones law.

Crumbley has since been charged with a couple of dozen counts of other crimes including four counts of murder, assault with intent to commit murder, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and terrorism.

So if those of us on the side of gun rights roll our eyes at the avalanche of all-too-predictable calls for MORE GUN CONTROL after a school shooting such as this, it’s because not only have we heard it all before, but because all of the laws ostensibly needed to “prevent” these things from happening are already on the books. And they have been for years.

Literally none of the additional laws that the usual suspects call for after a shooting like the one in Michigan would have done anything to prevent it. Not universal background checks, not banning “ghost guns,” not “red flag” laws, or regulating pistol braces our of existence.

Somehow, though, all of the myriad laws that are already in place don’t seem to stop murderous, determined little bastards from doing what their unhinged minds tell them they’re justified in doing. There’s literally no reason to expect passing more laws would do anything to stop another Ethan Crumbley in the future.

And the fact that there are already dozens of laws in place that prohibit what happened in Michigan never seems to matter much to those who dance in the victims’ blood and use these high profile shootings to further their anti-gun rights agendas.

    Because they need blood bathes to drum up their masses. It is funny that they hide behind the 1A and bash the 2A.

      Again they run to Gun Control because they know far too many “common sense” Gun Owners are going to attempt to defend their 2A Right with “reasoning” while their sugar and spice and everything nice Gun Control skates by without a scratch. How’s such “reasoning” working for you? Gun Control zealots have become quite comfortable setting the pace for far too many Gun Owners to follow like hungry puppy dogs.

      It is past time to take the Second Amendment out from under the microscope and put Gun Control under the microscope each and every time Gun Control zealots use a tragedy to play their Gun Control Card.

      The fact is History Confirms Gun Control in any shape, matter or form is Rooted in Racism and Genocide. Gun Control walks hand in hand with slave shacks, nooses, burning crosses, concentration camps, gas chambers, swastikas and other such insanity. If you want to “reason” with such filth then expect the worse because the real rot inherent with Gun Control always comes sooner or later. The so called “debate” to preserve The Second Amendment must boil down to the following brand of reasoning…

      1) The Second Amendment is one thing.

      2) The criminal misuse of firearms, bricks, bats, knives, vehicles, etc. is another thing.

      3) History Confirms Gun Control in any shape, matter or form is a racist and nazi based Thing.

          Progressive. Progressive thing. In America, gun control is a “progressive” thing because that’s our dominant strain of totalitarian.

          Everywhere it takes hold, gun control is a totalitarian control thing, and your own ostensibly benevolent totalitarian ideology is no exception. The reason we all have guns is so that we can kill the tyrants whenever they rear their ugly heads. Again…no exceptions.

    • avatar frank speak

      by all accounts though this is a pretty bizarre family…the exception to the rule…story has it they bought the gun (a pistol) for the kid as a X-mas present…a weird choice for an obviously troubled youth..then gave him legal advice before going on the lam…of course we have yet to hear their side of things…should be an interesting tale….

    What we need is more crazy and criminal control, not gun control.

    • avatar I Haz A Question

      Just remove all the guns and be done with it. All of man’s evils will disappear and we’ll live in love and compassion, right? Worked great for London in the U.K. With guns gone, there were no changes in behavior toward knives, which didn’t prompt TPTB to prohibit them as well while the knife assaults and murders rose. And thank God there weren’t any increases in attacks with hammers and battery acid.

      Sure glad that never happened. London has been a model for metros everywhere. Because those nasty guns, amirite?

        In Singapore it’s nearly impossible to own a firearm. It’s also nearly impossible to commit an unpunished crime. You only rape once in Singapore. Sell drugs once. They achieve this by quick trial and execution. The government is know to trample rights at whim, but you are unlikely to be a victim of street crime.
        In my opinion, why not start with severe and quick suppression of crime before going after firearms rights. Evidence shows drug trade is a huge motivator for street crime. Street drugs are a huge cause of fetal injury leading to lack of impulse control. Imagine if the people put an end to street drugs?

    What we really need is enforcement of the laws already on the books. We need to update our mental hygiene laws to be able to commit dangerous people. We need to have people using their heads and reporting people who exhibit behavior which is dangerous to the people.

    • avatar Rad Man

      So snitch lines and diluting due process is the answer? I agree with enforcing laws, but that takes money and effort. Clamoring for more gun control costs virtually nothing AND, to the non 2A public, makes it look like the powers that be are “doing something.”

      • avatar Walter E Beverly III

        Rad Man”Snitch lines, really? Give it a rest. If you know that someone is mentally unbalanced and is in possession of a firearm threatening to use it that is NOT “snitching”. It’s common sense. Where did I say that there should be more gun controls? I can remember when if a person wa a danger to himself or others, you contacted the police who brought the person to a doctor and that person was committed to a mental ward for up to a ten day hold to evaluate the subject.
        Effort? No, COMMON SENSE enforcement of existing laws.

          Miner49er Yawn! Seems you took that statement out of context. Trump was referring to Red Flag laws. NOT banning guns as you imply. Nice try, yet again. You have just used that age old anti-gun radical tactic. A lie!

      ” What we really need is enforcement of the laws already on the books ”

      Careful how you paint with such a broad brush. Most of the laws already on the books are either very onerous or totally useless. Before we enforce what’s on the books, we need to take a close look at what’s there and do some serious housecleaning.

      • avatar Walter E Beverly III

        UpinArms, Most of the laws that are on the books are not a problem really. The real problem is a LACK OF ENFORCEMENT.

        • avatar UpInArms

          ” Most of the laws that are on the books are not a problem really ”

          I’d be willing to bet that for every law you can name that is “not a problem” I can give you at least five that are. Take a close look at most of the gun laws that are out there and I’m confident that most of us — at least the ones that take ‘shall not be infringed’ seriously — would be very happy that these laws are not being enforced.
