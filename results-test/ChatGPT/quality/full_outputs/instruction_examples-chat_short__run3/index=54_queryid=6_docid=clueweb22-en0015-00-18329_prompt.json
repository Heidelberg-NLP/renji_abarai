Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is College Worth It? (Pros and Cons of College Education)

Is College Worth It? (Pros and Cons of College Education) – 2022

Ever since the European colonists arrived and established the foundation of “New College” (today is known as Harvard University) the debate over whether a college education is worthy of our money, effort and time seems to be one of the most salient, inquired questions that preoccupies the minds of high school graduates. 

Contemplating whether college is the right fit for you incorporates in itself several additional pivotal questions such as “With the tuition costs rising four to five times the rate of inflation over the course of the past three-plus decades, is college worth going; is it worth tethering myself to monthly college debt payments for decades?”, “Have the value and significance of the college degrees decreased?”, “Which are the factors that one needs to take into consideration when it comes to making this decision?”, “Is building a successful career a causal sequence of acquiring a college degree? Moreover, how important is college: what impact does a college degree have over the chances for employment as well as any potential future earnings?” 

Being one of the most crucial milestones in one’s life, the decision of whether or not to attend college is not one that should be taken lightly and made overnight; a contrary, being a life-altering decision, it requires thorough research, examination, and deliberation based on relevant statistics, data and facts about a college education

Having the answers to all of the previously mentioned questions is the most promising way towards ensuring that you are making the right decision. In order to help you get a better understanding of this subject, in this paper we will scrutinize up-to-date college statistics and discuss in depth the pros/cons of going to college alongside the potential impact that this decision may have on your future. 

Quick Facts & Statistics on College Education – 2021

  • In today’s market, 35% of all job offers require at least a bachelor’s degree. 
  • In 2019, the unemployment rate between those with a college degree was 2% compared to those with high school degrees 5.5%. 
  • On average bachelor’s degree holders earn 31% more than those with associate’s degrees and an incredible 84% more than those with just a high school diploma.
  • Due to the current crisis, 20% of students who were planning on enrolling in college now are reporting having second thoughts about enrolling in fall 2020. 
  • The bachelor degree holders are 47% more likely to have health insurance with 74% of their health coverage being contributed by their employers compared to those holding high school degrees.

Why is College Education Important?

On a personal level, a college education can be a significant contributor towards improving the quality of one’s life by helping one become more resourceful, responsible, and conscientious besides helping them develop knowledge and a particular set of skills in certain areas. These claims are supported by the Lumina Foundation report which established that:

1. College degree holders are demonstrating healthier habits than non-degree holders.

According to the Lumina Foundation report, higher education also means healthier habits which leads to a healthier lifestyle; they reported that based on their studies, the proportion of adults practicing smoking actually significantly decreases with an increase in education:

 “The proportion of working-age adults smoking daily falls from 20% of high school graduates without college to 12% of holders of associate degrees, to 5% of those with bachelor’s degrees as their highest education credential, to 3% of holders of graduate degrees.” 

Additionally, they continue to support this claim by providing a report from another NHIS survey that established a correlation between college education and exercise as well as college education and healthier eating habits. 

2. College-educated citizens provide more help to society through volunteering.

The previously mentioned report showed the additional benefits of college education that assist in generating better society; the studies showed that while the percentage of high school graduates who volunteered in their society is significantly low – 17%, this number goes way higher for more educated volunteers – 40% of working-age adults with at least bachelor degree participate in volunteering. 

Many students see volunteering as a way to gain real-world experience and a chance to sharpen their problem-solving and leadership skills, so they start doing it at college; studies showed that 4% of college graduates (age 25 and above) volunteer each year. According to the last report on the page of the Corporation for National & Community Service, 25.7% of college students volunteered, which is over 3 million volunteers who did 286 million hours of service just in 2015. 

Since this enriches their resume, many students see volunteering as a win-win situation.

Statistics are confirming that students are actually quite right about this: according to a study performed by Careerbuilder, the act of volunteerism is perceived as a valuable asset by over 60% of hiring managers when they are making recruitment decisions. They also confirmed that those who volunteer regularly have a 27% higher chance of getting employment.

3. College degree holders are better citizens: they donate 3 times more to charity.

While many may ascribe this to the fact that college degree holders have higher positions and therefore earn more money, it still doesn’t change the fact that college degree holders donate more. 

According to the Corporation for National & Community Service, volunteers are twice as likely to donate to a charity, and college degree holders are 3 times as likely. Lumina Foundation report further adds that college degree holders also are more than twice likely to participate in different social organizations, such as community, school, or religious organizations.

Is College Worth the Cost in 2021?

Considering the current epidemic that shook the entire world completely changing how the world works, at the beginning of this year, we witnessed many colleges withdrawing already accepted candidates, some waiting on to see what happens before they announce their reopening, third already announcing it and others, deciding to start classes online in the fall. Considering how much of a rollercoaster the college news has been, many wonders is college worthIs college necessary, are college degrees worth it in the upcoming years? The answer is yes, and statistics are here to back it up:

4. High school students are reconsidering going to college due to the pandemic.

Canceled classes, withdrawn applications, and pre-accepting candidates, confusing, non-clear messages regarding what colleges will offer this fall are the new reality for many high school students. Therefore, it’s not surprising that many students are reconsidering going to college: a Carnegie Dartlet survey which included 5000 seniors revealed that they are not sure whether they will be able to afford college; another study done in late March by SimpsonScarborough revealed that about 20% of high school respondents who were planning on enrolling in a 4-year college now are reconsidering their decisions. 

5. College value will increase in 2020, hence making college degrees more valuable, desired, and needed.

The Guardian reported that in May, “the number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million” this means that the unemployment keeps on rising; the department of Labor reported that in March the unemployment rate was 4.4%, in April it jumped to 14.7% which is a drastic change and even more drastic is expected in May. 

This means millions of people will be searching for jobs as soon as the situation improves, if not earlier; the question that students need to ask themselves then is, how will they be able to fight for a position in the pool of candidates without anything but a high-school degree?

With Recession expected as an inevitable consequence of all this, it’s worth looking at the statistics from the last one to see the true value of college degree and employment during the recession: At the peak of the great recession, 5% of bachelor degrees were jobless, compared to more than 3 times – 15.7% of youth workers with a high school degree.

 Albeit there may be other factors that will influence the predictions for the 2020 recession for sure, we can’t neglect that college degree holders will most certainly have an advantage over non-college degree holders. 

6. Сollege degree pays off and is key to economic opportunity.

If you are wondering are college degrees worth it, the answer is yes! According to the Centre of education and the Workforce, “College pays off over a lifetime, but occupation, gender, race and ethnicity matter too.” We will discuss more of these influences in the pro/con section. Moreover, they also report that a bachelor’s degree is valuable as on average bachelor’s degree holders earn 31% more than those with associate’s degrees and an incredible 84% more than those with just a high school diploma. 

Pros and Cons of College Education

The essential step in reaching the right decision as to whether you should attend college is comparing the pros and cons of it. On one hand, countless studies acknowledge the fact that college graduates tend to live happier, healthier, more successful lives and earn more money; however, on the other hand, there are also some education cons such as high tuitions, and the fact that college requires devotion and hard work, and not everyone is ready to give all to it.
