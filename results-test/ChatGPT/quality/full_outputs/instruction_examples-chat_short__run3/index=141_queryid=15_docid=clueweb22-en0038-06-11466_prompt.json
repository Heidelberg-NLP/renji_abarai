Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should People Use Animal Tested Cosmetics and Drugs to Protect Themselves from Dangerous Consequences?

Introduction

It is widely known that animals have long been used as the objects on which people carry out various experiments for their purpose. Currently, people involve animals in various types of researches: in medicine (drugs and injections), in biomedical research, and in the design of cosmetics. Animals are used for economic purposes; however, the peculiarities of these processes are not highlighted for people in open access.

There are specific ethical issues concerning animal testing in various types of industries. I believe that the use of animals in the cosmetic industry is unethical and should be prohibited, while animal testing for medical purposes can be allowed, as it often saves human lives, but such testing should be thoroughly regulated by the law.

Pros and cons of animal testing

Despite the fact that animal testing sometimes brings benefits for humanity, the government has not developed unambiguous principles concerning the use of animals in cosmetic researches. That is why Peggs, in her investigation, argued that “more could be done to ensure transparency and to extricate the vested financial interests from the human health benefits” (624). It is due to the fact that each year millions of animals are under the threat of extinction from biomedical experiments, which are conducted for human health benefits. It becomes evident that many animal testing experiments are carried out for human health benefits. This fact forces us to look at the moral side of the issue. Thus, the articulation of an ethical code here is somewhat complicated. The law which exists today relates only to the use of animals in the creation of drugs and vaccines. But there are no identified principles concerning the use of animals in biomedical researches or in the cosmetic industry, which are widely developed today (“Background of the Issue”). It can be seen that the development and adoption of ethical principles concerning the use of animals as objects in various types of research is of crucial importance.

The situation with the cosmetics industry is much more complex and controversial. I believe that the cosmetic industry and biomedical investigations are entirely different concepts because their initial purpose is different. With the help of cosmetics people try to decorate themselves and improve those traits which are given by nature. Their health will not deteriorate without it. But for the development of various cosmetic substances, people make animals, primarily rabbits, suffer because of the severe impact of these substances on their bodies. In the majority of cases, animals feel severe pain. Here, it is necessary to think philosophically and place the ecosystem in the center when making any decision. The principle of ecocentrism inspires to treat nature and the ecosystem as equal to humans by their importance (Animal Ethics par. 2-3). People should maintain and support biodiversity which exists on the Earth because it ensures thousands of processes which allow people to live on the planet. It is difficult to justify animal testing in the cosmetic sphere. Alternative methods of testing cosmetics should be developed, as they will be crucial for both animals and people.

Conclusion

As it can be seen, animal testing is carried out for various purposes. Some of them can be justified, but others cannot be. The case of animal testing is easier to be judged because of its initial purpose. It is unethical and should not be conducted. Instead, other methods of cosmetic testing should be developed. Animal testing in the healthcare industry is more controversial. It can be provided with the aim to bring benefits to human health and save millions of people. But at the same time, such testing destroys the biodiversity of the planet and is harmful to all living beings. The only way here can be the creation of proper codification which will take into account both sides of the issue and follow it.
