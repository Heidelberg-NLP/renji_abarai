Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Pro & Con Quotes: Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?

PRO (yes)

Pro 1

Crystal Adams, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Miami, in a Nov. 2016 article for Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Oncology titled “Direct-to-Consumer Advertising of Prescription Drugs Can Inform the Public and Improve Health,” wrote:

“Prescription drug advertisements spread valuable educational information about the promoted product and conditions associated with the drug. Better-educated patients can make well-informed decisions regarding their own health care…

DTCA [direct-to-consumer advertisements] can motivate patients to bring to physicians’ attention the information they receive about diseases and products in advertisements… Constraints on physicians’ time make it vital for patients to be educated outside of the physician’s office so that they can use the time with their physicians as effectively as possible… DTCA also motivates patients to disclose difficult to discuss issues, particularly for highly stigmatized diseases such as depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

The positive effects of DTCA on patients are grounded in evidence. These effects include greater involvement in medical decision-making, increased compliance with prescription medication intake, and improved patient-physician communication, which may lead to the diagnosis of previously undiagnosed medical conditions.”

Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical company, in a Mar. 2016 fact sheet titled “Direct-to-Consumer Communications,” available from pfizer.com, wrote:

“Consumers benefit from information about diseases and medical treatment options received through direct-to-consumer (DTC) communications, including advertising. DTC communication raises the awareness of medical conditions, informs consumers about the benefits and risks of medicines, and motivates people to discuss prevention, diagnosis, treatment and wellness information with their health care professional…

Pfizer believes that providing information to consumers about medical conditions and available treatments helps patients make educated choices about their health….

Pfizer supports the continued ability of companies to provide information to consumers about pharmaceutical products and medical conditions through ethical and responsible DTC communication that meets all regulatory requirements and industry standards.”

Pro 3

Adam Scott Roberts, Senior Vice President and Group Media Director at Communications Media, Inc., in a Nov. 15, 2013 article, “DTC Ads Should Do More than Raise Eyebrows,” available at mmm-online.com, stated:

“Consumers are informed by what they see online and on television from content and advertising. Consumers are actively bringing physicians information, asking about treatment options and even challenging decisions in an effort to manage their own health. Searching online across the healthcare continuum can shape an understanding for symptoms, treatment options and alternatives and even provide solutions on how to access and pay for therapies or medications…

It’s a pretty simple formula: information + education = participation—by being a participant in the management of a health journey, the voice of the consumer will be heard and the physician will help guide… Advertising done responsibly can participate and help provide value and utility without selling.”

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a pharmaceutical industry trade organization, stated the following in its Dec. 2008 “PhRMA Guiding Principles: Direct to Consumer Advertisements about Prescription Medicines,” available at phrma.org:

“An important benefit of direct to consumer (DTC) advertising is that it fosters an informed conversation about health, disease and treatments between patients and their health care practitioners.

A strong empirical record demonstrates that DTC communications about prescription medicines serve the public health by:

Increasing awareness about diseases;

Educating patients about treatment options;

Motivating patients to contact their physicians and engage in a dialogue about health concerns;

Increasing the likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care for conditions that are frequently under-diagnosed and under-treated; and

Encouraging compliance with prescription drug treatment regimens…

PhRMA members want patients and consumers to talk to their physicians about the medicines that may help them and to fully understand the known risks regarding these medicines. We know that DTC communications, particularly DTC television advertising, can be a powerful tool for reaching and educating millions of people.”

Pro 5

The American Advertising Federation, a national advertising trade association, stated the following in its Sep. 2008 position statement “DTC Prescription Drug Advertising,” available at aaf.org:

“The AAF supports the right of pharmaceutical companies to advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers, provided all claims are substantiated and appropriate disclosures are included in the advertising. Proposed moratoriums on pharmaceutical advertising would violate the First Amendment protection for commercial speech. Barring information from advertising will cause more harm to consumers who are not encouraged by an ad to see a doctor about an illness. Surveys show that these ads prompted more than 39 million to ask their doctor about a particular health condition. Advertising is an important source of information about pharmaceuticals.”

Daniel J. Carlat, MD, psychiatrist, stated the following in his Oct. 29, 2007 blog post “What’s Wrong with DTC Ads?,” available at the Carlat Psychiatry blog:

“I have certainly received an excessive dose of DTC ads… And, yes, I get that DTC’s encourage consumers to ask their doctors to prescribe the newest and most expensive meds.

But banning them doesn’t make sense. Why? For one, it’s one of the only arenas where drug companies advertise their products with full disclosure. Everybody knows it’s an expensive ad paid for by the company. There’s no pseudo-legitimate journal or medical education company pretending to be a scientific article, when in reality it’s a paid advertisement.

Second, they do serve an educational function for consumers, if biased. There are a lot of guys out there urinating very frequently who would not consider this a potentially treatable issue if they hadn’t seen those irksome Flomax commercials, the ones featuring the sports-crazed baby boomers who get to hang out in their kayaks longer without having to run into the woods–all because they’re taking their Flomax. Sure, viewers are going to run to their doctors and ask for Flomax my name, but it’s up to the docs to decide which drug is best. And meanwhile, some men will find out they have early prostate cancer (rather than benign prostatic hyperplasia) and might get their lives saved in the bargain.

I say let the companies have their DTC ads.”

AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company, in an Oct. 1, 2013 blog post written by Rod Wooten, Commercial Brand Leader for Crestor, titled “AstraZeneca Takes a New Advertising Approach to Engage & Educate Consumers,” available at the AstraZeneca Health Connections website, stated:

“AstraZeneca believes responsible direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is integral to raising disease awareness, fostering patient education, enhancing the patient/physician dialogue and encouraging medication adherence. And we also recognize that consumers today need to be engaged differently. Ads need to be both informative and compelling to make a lasting impression and to effectively raise awareness of an issue or a treatment.”

Richard E. Ralston, MA, Executive Director of Americans for Free Choice in Medicine, stated the following in his June 2005 article “Prescription Drug Advertising Is Good for All of Us,” available at capmag.com:

“Effective advertising of new drugs provides obvious benefits. Most importantly, it informs those with medical conditions about new treatments (including those who may have given up on getting relief). It may motivate them to discuss the condition with a physician for the first time, creating an opportunity for the physician to undertake testing and make a correct diagnosis. The physician may prescribe another medication better suited to the patient’s needs. Or, the physician’s knowledge of the condition’s serious consequences may alter the treatment course instead of just addressing the symptoms reported by the patient.”

Pro 9

Bob Ehrlich, MBA, Chief Executive Officer of DTC Perspectives, Inc., stated the following in his Feb. 19, 2010 article “A World Without DTC?,” available at the DTC Perspectives website:

“The best solution is to let information flow for DTC and other items with viable alternatives. There are plenty of sources of information on drugs, many of which are critical of branded drugs and offer alternatives. Government is free to publish clinical results that can refute claims of brands. Managed care can play one branded drug against another to get a great price. Doctors can decide if the branded drug really is better for their patients. Patients can check the Internet or ask friends if the drug works well. Putting the DTC information genie back in the bottle seems a bad alternative after 13 years of mass DTC availability.”
