Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Benefits of Having a Medical Cannabis Card in Recreational States

Even if you live in a recreational-use state, there are several advantages to becoming a medical marijuana patient.

Fewer Restrictions

Recreational cannabis is typically limited to patients over 21 years of age and comes with strict possession limits. As a medical marijuana patient, you face fewer restrictions and have more freedom to access your medication in greater quantities.

Greater Selection

A medical marijuana card affords you the privilege of shopping in both medicinal and adult-use dispensaries. Greater access means more products to choose from and more freedom to compare prices and find the best deals.

More Protection

Some recreational-use states still allow employers, landlords, and family courts to discriminate against cannabis users. A medical marijuana certification provides you with legal documentation demonstrating that your use is medically warranted. This can protect you against discriminatory or punitive actions in many states.

Better Prices

As a medical marijuana patient, you won’t be subject to the same sales or excise taxes required of recreational buyers. You may be able to save 10% or more on every purchase.

Proudly featured in:

In many cases, yes. Some states are allowing telemedicine evaluations. This means that you can complete your physician’s evaluation online and then apply for your medical marijuana card. The card—or at least the temporary card—is usually delivered via email, so you can complete every step of the registration process without leaving home. Telemedicine is not available in all states.
