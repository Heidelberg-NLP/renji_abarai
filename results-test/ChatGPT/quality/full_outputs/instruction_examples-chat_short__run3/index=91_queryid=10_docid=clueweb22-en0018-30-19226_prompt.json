Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Stem cells are used to treat so many different serious illnesses, many people now take samples of umbilical cord blood to store in case their child develops a disease such as certain cancers and disorders of the blood.

re: “unfounded rumors abound about it being dangerous”

There have been reports from around the world of very serious adverse reactions to the HPV vaccines.

So far none of my comments with links are going through.

In fact, Harald zur Hausen won the 2008 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering that essentially all cervical cancer is caused by HPV. And half a dozen studies of real girls have found the vaccine is already cutting risk of cin3 precancer by about half, as expected. (And it’s wiping out genital warts, too.) So there’s no question – the vaccine effectively prevents the majority of HPV related diseases.

Remember the MMR vaccine scare, when people became convinced the MMR vaccine caused autism? That turned out to be untrue. Something similar is going on with the HPV vaccine. It’s a touch of collective madness spread by quacks who hate modern medicine and amplified by poorly written news articles. When a child falls ill with any rare disease, some people prefer to blame the HPV vaccine rather than live with not knowing the cause.

That said, any shot can trigger fainting (it’s happened twice to me though not with HPV vaccine), so be sure to sit down for 15 minutes after any shot.

Tara, there is a great deal of evidence that most all cervical cancer is caused by the HPV strains.

Curious that so many extreme vaccine pushers don’t realize that vaccination requirements apply to public AND private schools. If they’re ignorant of the law, perhaps they are also unaware of the quality of the science?

You guys always come up with some reason not to vaccinate. I’d say the answer to your question is “no”. It’s hard to keep up with the laws in every state, especially if that’s not your job.

How much money has Merck given Harvard Medical school over the years? Or the AAP? Or any of the places Dr. McCarthy works for or writes for?

Sadly, the kids who are having life altering reactions to the HPV vaccine are being ignored. Just like the kids who become “autistic” after Merck’s MMR.

Merck destroying lives and not taking responsibility.

So could never getting a license…or never leaving the house, for that matter. It’s despicable how pharmaceutical interest has so greatly co-opted public health initiatives. If an elementary school is a breeding ground for sexually transmitted viruses, then it needs to be shut down and there should be substantial criminal persecution of faculty and parents. All the more shameful to see fear-mongering articles like this from institutions like Harvard. Whatever happened to the risk-benefit ratio we learned about in chemistry? Why are vaccines, especially numerous vaccines, continually touted as though they’re risk-free? The HPV vaccine is especially prone to adversarial response. What will be the cut-off in terms of schedule size? Exactly how many children have to be injured before their safety is put before profit margins? This vaccine is simply unnecessary, especially when you consider there is little evidence that said virus is linked to cancer.
