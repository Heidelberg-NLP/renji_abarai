You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Sexual Orientation: Definition & Facts

Instructor: Diane Davis
Sexual orientation refers to more than just one's sexual attraction. Delve into the definition of sexual orientation with facts about the most common categories, distinctions between sex and gender, and the varied times at which one realizes their identity. Updated: 02/04/2022

Definition

A person's sense of identity based on an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes is called sexual orientation. Sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of identity based not just on those attractions, but also on related behaviors and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.

Factors that Determine Orientation

There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. People express their sexual orientation through behaviors with others, including such simple actions as holding hands or kissing.

Research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex. However, sexual orientation is usually discussed in terms of three categories:

Three Categories of Sexual Orientation

  • Heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of the other sex)
  • Gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own sex)
  • Bisexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to both men and women)

Many cultures use identity labels to describe people who express these attractions. In the United States the most frequent labels are lesbians (women attracted to women), gay men (men attracted to men), and bisexual people (men or women attracted to both sexes). However, some people may use different labels or none at all.

Sexual Orientation is Distinct from Sex and Gender

Sexual orientation is distinct from other components of sex and gender, including biological sex (the anatomical, physiological, and genetic characteristics associated with being male or female), gender identity (the psychological sense of being male or female), and social gender role (the cultural norms that define feminine and masculine behavior).
