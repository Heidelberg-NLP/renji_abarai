        "content": "The opinion piece presents a clear argument that the lack of conflict resolution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict affects both sides, and that the current right-wing Israeli government is incapable of facing the reality of the existence of a Palestinian people. The piece also highlights the different perspectives within the right-wing, including denying the existence of a Palestinian people and those who talk about some form of autonomy for Palestinians without territorial control. The writer challenges the notion that the current government cannot negotiate with the Palestinians and argues that this is actually the best government to reopen negotiations because without the right wing engaged in actively framing the narrative, no solution is possible. Overall, the argument is well-structured and coherent. I would rate it as high quality."
