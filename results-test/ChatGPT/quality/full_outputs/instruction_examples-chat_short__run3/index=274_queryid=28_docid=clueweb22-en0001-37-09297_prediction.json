However, there are arguments for both sides of this issue. The article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of legalizing prostitution. Advocates of legalization argue that it gives sex workers labor rights and the ability to work in a safer environment. Meanwhile, advocates of the Nordic Model argue that prostitution should be decriminalized for the worker but criminalized for the buyer to deter demand for sexual exploitation."
