You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Must a Church Apply for Tax-exempt Status

Does a Church need to be a registered 501 (c)(3) Tax-exempt Organization?

Although not all non-profit organizations fall within section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, religious organization do. As such, this article focuses only on those 501(c)(3) organizations and whether or not a church must apply for tax-exempt status.

 

Defined:

According to the IRS, to be tax-exempt religious organization, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual. In addition, it may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities, and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.

Organizations described in section 501(c)(3) are commonly referred to as charitable organizations. Organizations described in section 501(c)(3), other than testing for public safety organizations, are eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions in accordance with Code section 170.

IRS:

Churches that meet the requirements of IRC Section 501(c)(3) are automatically considered tax exempt and are not required to apply for and obtain recognition of tax-exempt status from the IRS.

However, many churches will obtain tax-exempt status from the IRS. This is because in doing so, the church, as well as its members and contributors will qualify for related tax benefits. The primary benefit for contributors being that their donations are tax deductible on their income tax returns.

Churches that are part of a denomination or parent organization, may qualify under a group ruling given by the IRS. In such instances, the parent organization is the holder of a group ruling that identifies other affiliated churches as exempt. A church is recognized as tax exempt if it is included in a list provided by the parent organization and no further action to obtain recognition of tax-exempt status is necessary.

So depending on the situation, a church may not need to apply for and receive tax exempt status from the IRS. This is not the case in California.

California:

Most charities and nonprofit organizations operating in California must apply for and receive a determination or acknowledgement letter from the State Franchise Tax Board in order to be recognized as tax-exempt in the State. Unlike the automatic qualification under the IRS Code, churches and other religious organizations that desire tax-exempt status in California must apply for and be recolonized as such.

As per the State Franchise Tax Board, although most California laws deal with tax exemption patterned after the Internal Revenue Code, obtaining state tax-exempt status is a separate process from obtaining federal tax exemption. If a religious organization fails to apply for a receive tax-exempt status, it remains subject to the California Revenue and Taxation Code (R&TC) as a taxable entity.

Please note that churches and religious organizations may be legally organized in a variety of ways under state law, such as unincorporated associations, nonprofit corporations, corporations sole and chari­table trusts.
