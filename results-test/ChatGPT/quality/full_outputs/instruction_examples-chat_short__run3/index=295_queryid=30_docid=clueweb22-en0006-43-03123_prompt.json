Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

What happens if you conceal carry without a permit? - Quora

Nothing will “happen” unless you are caught. In which case the penalties vary by jurisdiction. In Nevada, you could be facing a Category C felony charge.

A category C felony is a felony for which a court shall sentence a convicted person to imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 5 years. In addition to any other penalty, the court may impose a fine of not more than $10,000, unless a greater fine is authorized or required by statute.

Don’t get caught. If you use concealed gun to defend yourself, in say, a mugging you may be in trouble if the criminal wants to go after you if he lives. This also varies wildly by state. Some states allow concealed carry without a license or permit. Some states will prosecute you with a felony for illegal carry even if you are being mugged! Go figure. You will need to spend money with a competent lawyer well versed with your state’s gun laws. This applies if you are legally carrying with a permit. You may be arrested anyway.

Once again, go figure.

I am happy to announce that on September 1, 2021 in my Great State of Texas absolutely nothing will happen. Unless you are under 21, a convicted felon, or adjudicated as mentally incompetent. That is the day that Texas will join 20 other states and have Constitutional Carry. At last following the 2nd Amendment.

What happens if you conceal carry without a permit?

That would depend on if you are in a Constitutional carry state, or one of those states run by un-American communist US hating demonicrats.

As of June 16, 2021, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota (residents only; concealed carry only), Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee (handguns only), Texas, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming do not require a perm...

It depends on the jurisdiction. As others have mentioned there are a significant number of states where no permit is required. In states where a permit is required the penalties vary. You might be charged with a misdemeanor and, assuming you have no criminal record, be offered a Deferred Sentence. Or a plea bargain might be contingent on you agreeing to give up, and never again possess, firearms. In other jurisdictions you might be committing a felony and face prison time. And then there are the nuances. In some states a concealed carry permit holder is allowed to carry onto school grounds as

It depends on the jurisdiction. As others have mentioned there are a significant number of states where no permit is required. In states where a permit is required the penalties vary. You might be charged with a misdemeanor and, assuming you have no criminal record, be offered a Deferred Sentence. Or a plea bargain might be contingent on you agreeing to give up, and never again possess, firearms. In other jurisdictions you might be committing a felony and face prison time. And then there are the nuances. In some states a concealed carry permit holder is allowed to carry onto school grounds as long as they do not remove their gun from the car (e.g., you are picking your child up from school). However if you do not have the permit then you are committing a felony by driving onto school grounds. Concealed Carry in National Parks is governed by state law as long as you don’t enter a federal facility (e.g., the ranger station or visitor center). So if you carry without a permit in a National Park that is located in a state where a permit is required you will also be in violation of federal law.

The bottom line is that if you are in a jurisdiction in which carrying without a permit is a crime, you will be subject to criminal penalties, have a criminal record, and likely lose your right to possess a firearm for the rest of your life. Yes, as with any crime, you have to get caught to be subject to these penalties. That should not be an excuse for disobeying the law, as tempting as that could be in certain situations (e.g., where you have a legitimate fear for your safety). And if you do decide to violate the law then you have to be willing to accept the consequences.

Depends on the state you're in, here in Michigan, doing so is a felony level offense. But in states like Kansas, permitless concealed carry is legal. The caveat with Kansas though, is if you carry concealed in a posted no guns area without a license, it's a misdemeanor weapons charge. Here in Michigan, you only get at worst, a tresspassing charge if you get caught and then refuse to leave, unless its one of the places on the back of your license listed as a prohibited premises.

Well it’s like cheating on your taxes. Maybe you don’t get caught but if you do you are totally screwed. I would always recommend that you do this the right way and get your license.

23 states allow concealed carry without a license or permit. But most other states require a cpl . In those states, if stopped by Police, you will be arrested if you are carrying a pistol concealed, without a license

Depends on what kind of person you are, your social habits and if your “look” checks off boxes in the minds of LEOs. For a man a short haircut, tucked in shirt,clean/polished leather shoes and a calm demeanor means you can probably carry a pistol every day of your life without a permit and never have a problem.

I carried for years without a permit because my state didn’t have them yet. I never had any trouble and even when my gun was noticed by a bystander my look and demeanor caused them to assume that I was entitled to do so.

Depends on what state and if you are legally allowed to have a gun. In about 40% of the United States there is constitutional carry which is valid in your resident state. So you could be legally carrying concealed without a permit, in the states where a permit is required you are going to jail assuming in public. Now all states have these sign only gun free zones, in them it can range from trespassing if you are discovered and don’t leave when asked to up to a felony in others.

Well, nothing, until you get caught. Read the laws in your state to know what the penalties are. Furthermore, what would be the point of carrying a firearm if not for self defense? If you ever use your firearm and do not have the legal permit to carry, you are in a world of hurt. You will be on the wrong side of the law, and you will go to jail.

It varies from state to state. I live in Alabama where you would have your weapon confiscated and have to pay a fine. Other states are more harsh.

What happens if you conceal carry w/o a permit? If you don’t print and don’t get caught, then just that: you’re CC’ing w/o a permit.

If you do get caught, then you’ll find out. That’s what will happen…

Specifically where are you asking about? It matters, because some places it is legal to carry a concealed firearm without a permit, called “Constitutional Carry” in the U.S., but in other places a permit is needed to be legal.

Well he has been a bit distracted by a non stop Coup Attempt.

I think I can give him a pass on that.

It depends. There is a legal justification for use of deadly force against someone who is not armed. It is called a disparity of force:

Disparity of force means when an ostensibly unarmed man is so likely to kill or cripple you, his physical advantage becomes the equivalent of a deadly weapon, and warrants your recourse to a gun or knife or whatever in self-defense.

In my case as a 68 old man with physical disabilities, a young fit 33 year old man can cause me serious harm, even death just using his superior strength. If he attacked me with punches and strangling I could use my gun to shoot him.
