        "content": "This text provides information about statistics education, including the goals of statistics education, such as cognitive goals (i.e., statistical literacy, reasoning, and thinking) and non-cognitive goals (i.e., beliefs, dispositions, and attitudes). The authors note that cognitive goals, for example, include teaching students to design investigations, collect data, and propose and justify conclusions based on data. Furthermore, the text explains that statistics educators should be aware of students' attitudes, beliefs, and dispositions toward statistics and the learning environment. The authors of this text also describe the curriculum for statistics in New Zealand and the UK. Overall, the text presents information in an organized and thoughtful manner, with clear language and examples used to support the arguments. Therefore, it appears to have a high rhetorical argument quality."
