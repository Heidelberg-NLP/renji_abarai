Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Can Felons Vote in Illinois?

You can vote in Illinois if you previously served a felony prison sentence, are waiting for sentencing, or are in the midst of a trial. You cannot vote if you are a convicted felon about to go to prison, or are currently in jail or prison for a felony.

Voting While Detained in County Jail

2019 law allows eligible voters in county jail to vote by mail. It also requires election authorities to set up temporary polling places in county jails. This law (SB 2090) only applies to counties with over three million people.

If you are confined or detained in a county jail in one of these counties, you must be given a chance to vote.

Your Right to Vote Before or After a Felony Sentence

You have the right to vote if you are currently:

  • Waiting for a judge to formally list the charges against you
  • Waiting for your trial to start (if you are in jail waiting for trial, you can vote by mail)
  • Charged with a felony (anytime before you are officially convicted of the crime)
  • Out of jail or prison
  • An ex-offender
  • On parole or probation (or other post-incarceration programs through the Illinois Department of Corrections)
  • In the process of appealing a felony charge or a felony conviction

After your sentence, you are considered an ex-felon, and your criminal record cannot stand in the way of your vote.

Felon Voting Rights Under Illinois State Law

When you leave jail or prison, your right to vote returns right away. Technically, it is reinstated when the staff removes your name from the felony conviction list.

The county voting registry will no longer see your name on this list, and you will not be stopped from voting. Your eligibility to vote is handled through the Illinois Secretary of State. Remember that you may need to show proof that you served your sentence if the registry is behind on data.

A Felony Doesn't Mean You Lose Your Voting Rights

Rest assured that a felony conviction and serving time does not take away your right to vote forever. You do not need to do anything after leaving jail or prison to reinstate your voting rights. If a polling place does not let you vote, you may need to:

  • Show proof you served your sentence
  • Call the Sectary of State's office to ask why your name is still on the felony conviction list
  • Get help from an attorney experienced in voting rights restoration

First Time Voters After Prison or Jail

If this is the first time you have voted in years, you will need to complete voter registration or re-register to vote. You can vote in any state or federal election as long as your sentence was served, and your name is no longer on the felony conviction list.

You have the right to use an absentee or mail-in ballot for early voting in upcoming elections. You cannot be stopped from voting if:

  • You don't have a permanent address. There is an affidavit (legal document) you can sign saying you don't have a permanent address or photo ID. Your vote will still be counted.
  • You don't have a government-issued ID. Check this list for other forms of acceptable IDs, or you can choose to sign an affidavit that says you don't have a photo ID.
  • You are overseas but still a resident of Illinois. You can use a mail-in ballot or seek help for overseas voters.
  • You can prove you served your sentence, or your name has been removed from the felony conviction list.

Other States and the Future of Felony Disenfranchisement

Since state law determines which felons get to vote, there are many states that still do not allow felons to vote after they have served their sentences. If you move to one of these states, you will lose your voting rights.

There is a movement to stop the disenfranchisement of felons nationwide. Many argue that all people with felony convictions, including those in prison, should be able to vote.

Learn About Voting While in Prison

While you cannot vote, there is still an opportunity to be ready to vote upon your release.

The Illinois Department of Corrections is required, under HB 2541, to provide neutral, non-partisan programs led by peers to educate incarcerated people on:

  • Voting rights
  • Government process, agencies, and companies
  • Current affairs
  • Elections and the democratic process

They also offer practice voting booking sessions and voting sessions.

Register to Vote Today

Register at the DMV, online, in person, or by mail. Polling places have special accommodations and on-site staff to help you sign affidavits and protect your right to vote. Learn more in our Illinois Voting Guide.

Denied the Right to Vote?

Suppose a polling place is denying your right to vote. You should talk to a civil rights attorney about your charges not being cleared yet, or the polling staff trying to stop you based on your criminal record.
