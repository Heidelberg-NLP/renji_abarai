Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Dubai: Plastic water bottles offering less than 200ml of liquid capacity will no longer be allowed in Bahrain, local media reported.

According to the Testing and Metrology Directorate, the ban covers the production, distribution and import of pre-packed plastic water bottles with a volume of fewer than 200ml. The move aims at reducing the impact of plastic waste on the environment.

It also follows the November decision by UN climate summit COP26 in Glasgow, United Kingdom, to ban some of the most environmentally damaging items by June this year.

The ban also covers all plastic containers used to fill the water of various types, natural, gaseous, treated and sweetened. Shaikh Hamad bin Salman Al Khalifa, Assistant Undersecretary for Domestic and Foreign Trade, said the ministry would not also allow entry to shipments that are not free of bottles having fewer than 200ml capacity. The new decision, he said, is also valid for local factories, which will not be allowed to supply bottles with less than 200ml. 

Watch: Bahrain fetes self-effacing philanthropist Al Daylami

‘Father of orphans’ touched by ‘sudden’ traffic signal appreciation

Cairo: Bahraini architect Khalil Al Al Daylami stops at a traffic signal fastening the seat belt around him as he sits behind the wheel. Suddenly, a group of people appear in front carrying a sign reading in Arabic: ”Attention! A hero is in front of you!” They are clad in vests forming on the back the phrase: “Khalil Al Daylami, we’re proud of you.”

Reinforcing the message, a truck comes in sight, carrying the name of “Khalil Al Daylami the hero”. As tears well up to the man’s eyes, his portrait graces windows of cars stopping next to him and big banners appear showering him with praise, calling him “You’re outstanding”.

Nicknamed the “father of orphans”, Al Daylami is acknowledged for looking after hundreds of orphans and offering support for the poor through his charity.

The man was recently invited by “You’re Outstanding”, a show aired on Bahraini TV during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan celebrating people who contribute positively to society. Al Daylami, also known as Abu Ahmed, is one of them.

In its effort to display surprise appreciation to him, the show-makers asked Al Daylami to hit the road to run-test a new car. He did, only to find himself the focus of the praise heaped on him at the traffic signal. He did not know that the car was fitted with a camera to catch his reaction.

Humbly impressed inside the car, the man also saw on an in-built screen some orphans, employees and his son hosted by the show and hailing his philanthropy.

“He would never let us down or even fall back on his duty,” one orphan says.

Abu Ahmed’s relationship with the orphans is fatherly, an employee at his charity, says. “When we take a trip to an amusement park, he would play with the children,” she adds. He would ask the orphans to call him Baba “father” Khalil.

The man sounds selfless and modest. As tearful Daylami gets off the car, he is welcomed by people from the show, some of whom carrying signs reading: “You’re outstanding. You’re dedicated”. In response, he says: “Orphans deserve much more. Frankly, I don’t deserve all this. Allah is the one who has been generous to me. I’m nothing.”

Interestingly, when he appeared on the show, some websites mistook him for Khalil Al Daylami, an Iraqi lawyer who led the defence team for Saddam Hussein before his execution in 2006.
