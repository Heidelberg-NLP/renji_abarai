Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Pressured by US congressmen John Dingell and Bart Stupak, Pfizer announced last week that it would end its current advertising campaign for Lipitor – the one featuring Robert Jarvik, of artificial heart fame. I read Pfizer’s press release, then saw how the news was reported by The New York Times.

First, as someone who’s been translating management-speak for over two decades, I have to note the Times’ rewording and selective quoting, which yield an admission of deceit and a resolve to change far deeper and more sweeping than were actually expressed by Pfizer. (If these aren’t obvious, let me know and I’ll point them out.) But even more disappointing is the Times’ failure to seize on the real issue here and highlight the need for public debate on it. What’s really at the heart of this matter is not the time-honored institution of the celebrity pitchman and how he should be presented. It’s the question of whether big pharma should be marketing prescription drugs to consumers at all.

Now that is an interesting question, particularly at this moment in American history. On the one hand, there is a broad distaste for pharmaceutical profits and a suspicion that, in going around the traditional channel of the family doctor, these firms are just looking for an easier mark. On the other hand, there is a growing belief that consumers must take more control of their health care, as their interactions with medical providers become more dispersed and transactional. (If you believe the latter, it’s hard to argue that drug marketing – long a source of relevant information to physicians – should be confined to physicians going forward.)

Pfizer apparently wants to engage in that debate. In its press release, it states its position up front: “Direct-to-consumer advertising is an important way to provide consumers with information about their health and treating disease, and at least 29 million Americans have talked to their physicians about a health condition for the first time after seeing a pharmaceutical advertisement.” It’s interesting that its antagonists’ angle of attack is less straightforward.

With regard to the sins Pfizer does admit it is hard to work up a high moral dudgeon. An actor sat in for Jarvik in a scenic rowing shot – and it’s a sport he doesn’t engage in. Jarvik takes Lipitor personally, but only started doing so when he’d accepted the offer to endorse it. Jarvik graduated medical school after embarking on a career as a medical device engineer, but never went on to practice medicine – a fact that, if disclosed, might have made the viewer more skeptical of his authority. Don’t get me wrong: I hate deceptive advertising as much as the next consumer. But in an era of undisclosed product placements and stealthy word-of-mouth agents, this doesn’t seem like the marketer to go after. Unless, again, drug companies shouldn’t be talking to consumers at all.

What do you think?
