Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Pregnancy in incarcerated women: need for national legislation to standardize care

Smriti Nair, James E. McGreevy, Juana Hutchinson-Colas, Heather Turock, Frank Chervenak, Gloria Bachmann and NJ on Women’s Reentry-Health Subcommittee

Abstract

Objectives

This review examined prenatal care provided to incarcerated women to identify areas where improvement is needed, and examined current legislative gaps such that they can be addressed to ensure uniform templates of care be instituted at women’s prisons.

Methods

Data were compiled from 2000-2021 citations in PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords: prison AND prenatal care AND pregnancy.

Results

Although the right to health care of inmates is protected under the Eight Amendment to the United States Constitution, the literature suggests that prenatal care of incarcerated individuals is variable and would benefit from uniform federal standards. Inconsistency in reporting requirements has created a scarcity of data for this population, making standardization of care difficult. Although incarceration may result in improved access to care that women may not have had in their community, issues of shackling, inadequate prenatal diet, lack of access to comprehensive mental health management, and poor availability of opioid use disorder (OUD) management such as Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) amd Opioid Treatment Programs (OTP), history of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are just a few areas that must be focused on in prenatal care. After birth, mother-baby units (MBU) to enhance maternal-fetal bonding also should be a prison standard.

Conclusions

In addition to implementing templates of care specifically directed to this subgroup of women, standardized state and federal legislation are recommended to ensure that uniform standards of prenatal care are enforced and also to encourage the reporting of data regarding pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in correctional facilities.

Introduction

Prenatal care for incarcerated women is a topic that has not been extensively researched and therefore templates of care are typically based on standard prenatal care guidelines. This paper underscores the need for legislation regarding standardized prenatal care in incarceration while also providing an introduction of the NJ Commission on Women’s Reentry and the Commission’s focus. Current data suggest that establishing focused care guidelines for this subgroup of women and supporting legislation to uniformly incorporate these guidelines into the prison system, along with allocation of adequate funding resources, are necessary to optimally support maternal and fetal outcomes. Proper prenatal care is essential to perinatal health, and providing adequate care to incarcerated women will support healthy growth and development of the fetus. With an established standard of prenatal care, gaps in maternal health can be identified and addressed thereby improving the health outcomes of pregnancies during incarceration.

Data regarding maternal and fetal outcomes in incarceration are scarce, allowing few studies to explore a detailed account of maternal and fetal outcomes in incarceration. Requiring correctional facilities to provide data regarding maternal health data would allow for further research and analysis and the identification of gaps in prenatal care in correctional facilities. It is our hope that this paper will not only encourage further research into this topic, but also encourage legislative action to protect the healthcare needs of incarcerated pregnant women.

Incarceration of women in the US is increasing. While incarcerated pregnant individuals occur in many countries, there is a disproportionate occurrence in the US which houses one third of all such individuals in the world [1]. More than 66% of incarcerated women report having children under 18 years old, and about 6% of this population are pregnant at the time of arrest [2]. Policies governing jails and prisons in the United States are not dependent on gender, and thus, female and male prisons are operated in the same manner. Because of this standard, the unique needs of women typically are not addressed, which translates to an overall negative impact on women’s health. Further, states are not required to report data on pregnancy among incarcerated women, and as a result, there are large data gaps regarding prenatal outcomes. For this reason, it is difficult to determine the precise number of women who are affected by the lack of adequate prenatal care in US prisons and jails.

In 2004, only 54% of incarcerated pregnant individuals received prenatal care [3]. Many of these pregnancies are high risk due to the interaction of several adverse social scenarios, including barriers to accessing healthcare, poor education, drugs/alcohol use, and low socioeconomic status. For example, data suggest that the incarcerated woman’s pregnancy is often complicated by substance-use disorders, anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and other mental illnesses [4]. In addition to these factors, poor social support systems and abusive relationships also contribute to the increased perinatal and postnatal morbidity and mortality seen among incarcerated women and their children. After the child’s birth, interruption of a critical bonding period often occurs, as the newborn may be separated from the mother [5].

In addition to no national legislation mandating prisons to provide physical or mental health services to inmates, standards of care for pregnant inmates also have been inadequately addressed on national and state levels. As of 2011, 38 states have failed to create and uphold policies guaranteeing adequate prenatal care for incarcerated women [6]. Furthermore, for incarcerated pregnant women, 41 states do not require prenatal nutrition counseling or education and 48 states do not provide HIV screening [6]. In many states, the use of restraints such as handcuffs and shackles also are not restricted, despite data noting that this practice has negative physical effects on the physical and mental health of the mother and her child. In 13 states, shackle use is unrestricted, and can even be used during the vulnerable times of pregnancy and labor [7].

To address the needs of pregnant incarcerated women, as well as all incarcerated women, New Jersey legislated the NJ Commission on Women’s Reentry. This multidisciplinary group, that includes several women’s health care providers, is actively addressing women’s health care while in prison and afterwards, with reentry into their community. The Commission also is establishing templates of care to appropriately manage the unique needs of the expectant mother and her infant [8].

This review evaluated data on pregnancy issues that are prevalent in incarcerated women to highlight their special needs and to further support the passing of state and federally legislated standards of care.

Methods

Data were obtained from several sources that addressed prenatal care during incarceration. A literature search of several online databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, compiled relevant citations from 2000 to 2021 using the keywords: prison AND prenatal care AND pregnancy AND incarceration.

Results

Mental health of incarcerated pregnant women

Incarcerated women are particularly at risk for problems with mental health, with nearly two thirds reporting a history of mental health problems [9, 10]. Although women may have improved access to behavioral health treatment while incarcerated as compared to their level of access prior to incarceration, this is due to their having received little to no treatment for mental illness in their communities prior to incarceration [11]. With pregnancy, women are particularly vulnerable to mental health problems and with the added stress of incarceration, their mental health status may be further compromised.

Mental health screening in the prison before, during, and after pregnancy allows for the early detection of mental health issues, the worsening of mental health status and its early management. Early intervention improves not only maternal, but also fetal outcomes, such as low birthweight and premature delivery [12]. There also have been associations of adverse birth outcomes with maternal anxiety. After delivery, there is forced separation of child from mother, further maternal stress occurs, creating a high-stress environment conducive to mental trauma.

Physical/sexual trauma

Among female inmates, trauma, be it sexual, physical or both, is often a shared experience. A history of sexual or physical trauma may contribute to a high risk-pregnancy or pregnancy related complications, and providing therapeutic interventions for these individuals may positively impact their and their child’s health [13]. A trauma-informed approach by the prison health care team can reduce this negative impact on mental health. For instance, in the case of a pregnant patient with a history of sexual abuse, pelvic and breast exams may be traumatic and have to be done in a way that takes this issue into consideration. Physical exposure of the genitalia during childbirth also can cause traumatization in previously abused women and in some C-section may be the best option.Those who have PTSD may need to have special birthing accommodations as PTSD symptoms can be triggered by a high stress birth [14].
