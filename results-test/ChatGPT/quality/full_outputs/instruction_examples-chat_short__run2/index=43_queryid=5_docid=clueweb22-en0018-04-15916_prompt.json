Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

It is not the place of private prisons to administer punishments. It is the State orgovernment that decides who is a prisoner so they should remain responsible for them untilrehabilitated. It is wrong to put a private company that makes a profit off a being in charge ofprison operations because their goal is profit not punishment or rehabilitation. Private prisonsthat cut costs may risk security problems because cutting costs often means cutting corners. Ithink private prisons are wrong, but .Prison should not be privatized because the path to profit is to treat human beings badly.Prisons are based on two things custody and care.

"One way for-profitprisons to minimize costs is by skimping on provisions, including food. “ A psychiatrist whoinvestigated a privately run prison in Mississippi found that the inmates were severely underfedand looked “almost emaciated.” During their incarceration, prisoners lost anywhere from 10 to60 pounds." Citation Steven StarkeyAdditionally, there is a financial incentive to do a bad job. The more effective acorrectional facility is, the less need of its services. If the inmates have educational, work releaseprograms, medical care such as anger management or mental health while locked up its lesslikely for them to return to a prison after being released.

Yoursentences should be complete and answer the prompt in light of what you are reading beforeyou.
1)I, the reader, feel the topic of this paper is stated quite plainly and a clear position istaken on it because (why or why not?):
I do not feel this because a lot of times the point is hard to understand in this essay, the thesisis lost many times throughout the paper and the evidence is not there.

I, the reader thinks that this paper lacks sufficient justification regarding the topic on privatization of prisons. The essay also contained several incomplete sentences which disrupts my ability to fully comprehend the topic. In addition, the structure of the essay lacks cohesiveness and coherence.  

Upon reading the persuasive essay, there have been numerous errors observed particularly on grammar, sentence structure, as well as maintaining coherence and cohesiveness. A persuasive essay is meant for the reader's to be fully convinced with one's take on a certain topic. A person's justification must be clearly stated in a way that is concise yet comprehensive enough for the reader's to completely understand the topic. Poor construction of essay of such type does not fully serve its purpose- that is to convince the readers. 

2)Name 2 elements of the writing process you think this author needed to considermore thoroughly in stating his/her position.
I believe the author should have considered the evidence and the structure elements ofthe writing process more while stating their position. Fixing these things wouldimprovethe essay and make it much easier to understand.

The author should have started by considering the responsibilities of private companies in jail management before taking a position and providing rationales for why prisons should not be closed down. Second, the author may have offered a high-level review of the criminal justice system's processes and the modifications that would be required to make it more efficient and effective.

Should Not Privatize Prisons3)Did you find the research element to be covered sufficiently in this persuasiveresearch essay? Why or Why Not?No, I did not because the links all lead to pages not found and there were not credible sites tobegin with, instead the writer could have used more credible sources.

After reading the persuasive research essay, I may conclude that the research elements are not adequately used and covered in this essay. When we say persuasive research essay, the purpose of this paper is to convince others by giving evidences as a support and ideas about the topic. In thid kind of writing, research elements should be used correctly. Research elements are the important things that a persuasive essay should have. However,  it didn't use the research elements correctly.  This type of writing needs facts and evidences. In this essay, the reference part is not properly used. Aside from that, research elements like data about the topic is not sufficient enough to support the argument. 

Furthermore, research elements in this kind of writing can make the argument or position stronger, powerful and create more credibility. The author should include a comprehensive and relevant evidence and present the facts or evidences by citing the sources correctly. 

To sum up, I may conclude that this persuasive research essay is not effective to persuade the readers. The author should remember that by backing the ideas or content with research,  his/her essay can turn into credible essay that effectively convince the readers.

4)Consider the sentence structures here. Do they demonstrate the writer’s criticalthinking ability in this exercise? Why or Why Not?No, the author tended to use many simple sentences over and over they could have used a fewcompound or complex or compound complex sentences to demonstrate their thinking abilitymore clearly.

The correct answer 

Sentence structure refers to the grammatical arrangement of a sentence. Your writing's sentence structure comprises the placement of nouns and verbs within each phrase.

Due to multiple incomplete sentences, capitalization problems, and comma issues, the sentence constructions do not exhibit the critical thinking of the writer ability in this task. Several phrases were likewise left unfinished, without periods.
