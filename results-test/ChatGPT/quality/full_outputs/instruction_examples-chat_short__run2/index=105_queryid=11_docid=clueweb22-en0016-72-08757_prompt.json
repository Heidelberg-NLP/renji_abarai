Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

  8. 8. Moral and Ethical Issues Many athletes, coaches, politicians and fans feel the use of certain substances is unethical in sports.
  9. 9. The Spirit of Sport I believe that drugs shouldn’t be used in sports and that any athlete caught using performance- enhancing drugs should be banned from all future sports events without being given second chances.
  10. 10. Pressure is Placed on Athletes to Perform Better Today's athlete faces an increasingly difficult choice: to use drugs to enhance performance or to accept what could amount to be a competitive handicap that is to be in a competition with other athletes who may certainly be using PEDs.

  15. 15. • Anabolic steroids: the effects of androgens include accelerated growth of muscle, bone, and red blood cells, and enhanced neural conduction. • Human Growth Hormone: HGH promotes and increases the synthesis of new protein tissues, such as in muscle recovery or repair. This is the way new muscle is built. • Creatine: Increasing strength in people with muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy. What Drugs Are Mostly Used

This can help with blood doping tests in the future
  22. 22. • In the past athletes played for love of the game. • Today the players have so much more at stake than just being able to play the game because they love it. Athletes will use any means necessary to get performance enhancing drugs (PED). • These drugs will cost athletes thousands of dollars, but to them it is a small price to pay for the success it can bring to their career.
  23. 23. • The use of performance-enhancing drugs is not accidental; it is planned and deliberate with the sole objective of getting an unfair advantage. • There are several reasons to ban performance- enhancing drugs: – respect for the rules of sports, – recognition that natural talents and their perfection are the point of sports

    If they test positive more than once they can be banned from competition for up to one year and may lose their scholarship, and some may even be banned from competition completely and are no longer able to participate in sport.
    Some cases of drugs testing are disputed and this can lead to a hearing, arbitration and to courts at both national and international level.
