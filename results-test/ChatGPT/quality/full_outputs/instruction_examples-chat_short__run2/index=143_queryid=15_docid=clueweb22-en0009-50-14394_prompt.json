Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Animals Be Used For Scientific Experiments?

Best Essays
A dog is a man’s best friend, is a commonly used phrase to describe an intimate relationship between human and dog that has developed over the centuries. But is this popular phrase true? Are dogs truly a mans best friend? Some argue of course they are— they are friendly, loyal, and in most cases considered a part of the family. But there are those who will disagree—people from other parts of the world, and at different times in history. Take scientists from the nineteenth century, for example, where a man’s best friend was used in scientific experiments that led to the discovery of insulin for diabetes, and saved millions of lives (MacGill: par. 1, 2016). So, where do we draw the line from justifying the use of animals for scientific…show more content…
Lastly, I will conclude by highlighting the main ideas, and will finish off with my own reflections regarding the debate.
Source Methodology This section will describe sources, both academic (scholarly journals and peer review), and popular (articles, blogs) that has been used. All sources were equally important and essential to the formulation of all findings presented in this research paper.
Academic Sources All sources listed in this section are all peer reviewed or are written by academic scholars, that speak to the debate on animals and scientific experiments. For my scholarly sources I examined the following publications: Firstly I used Laura Cox and V. Tamara Montrose’s empirical research, “How Do Human-Animal Emotional Relationship Influence Public Perceptions of Animal Use?” Journal of Animal Ethics. 2016. DOI:10.5406. Both authors have acquired PhD’s and a bachelor’s degree in animal sciences. According to the publisher, this particular journal is dedicated to research regarding animal ethics, and issues in the field of animal sciences, and therefore is useful to this research topic. Another academic research based journal I reviewed was, Cattaneo C. et al.,“Animal Experimentation in Forensic Science: How Far Have We Come?” Forensic Science International. 2015. DOI: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.06.024. The authors
