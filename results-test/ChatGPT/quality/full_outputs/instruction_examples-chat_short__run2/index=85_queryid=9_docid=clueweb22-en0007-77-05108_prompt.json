Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Why Should Students Wear School Uniforms?

Why Should Students Wear School Uniforms?

Uniforms form an essential part of school life in a lot of schools around the world. Students are expected to abide by a strict dress code where everyone wears the same school uniform. But why is this custom necessary? Why should all the students be made to wear the same uniform? There are a lot of reasons for this.

1. Save cost

Now imagine a scenario where your children are supposed to wear casual clothes everyday to school. This would mean that they would want to buy a lot of fancy clothes frequently. Add to it the impact of peer pressure and no amount of clothes would be enough for them. Now instead, if they are supposed to wear a uniform throughout the year, it solves the problem completely. Having a few pairs of uniform that would last your children at least for 2-3 years is much better than spending on new clothes every few days. Thus, a uniform substantially reduces the cost of school clothing for your children.

2. Equality among student

One of the biggest reasons why uniforms are promoted and appreciated throughout the world is because they promote equality among students. Since all the children come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, they would have different quality of clothes. Now if the students are to wear these different casual clothes to school, it would create a sense of inequality. Some would feel richer and have a superiority complex while others would feel poorer and have an inferiority complex. It would also make students judge each other on the basis of their clothes and the assumed socio-economic status. Now instead if all the children have to wear the same uniform, this class divide diminishes. All the students would be wearing the same dress, thus creating a sense of equality amongst them.

3. Positive learning environment

School is a place where students are supposed to learn and grow, personally as well as professionally. However, efficient learning requires a certain mindset. A positive learning environment is required which would felicitate the urge to learn in students. That is why schools are build in a particular way that promotes learning. However, when you allow students to wear casual clothes to school, you are taking away that sense of sincerity and seriousness out of the school environment. Instead, if you make them all wear a uniform, it would create a more structured and disciplined environment. A mindset will be created that will encourage students to focus on learning while wearing the uniform. Thus, school uniforms play a very important role in building a school environment that will encourage students to learn more and more.

Apart from this, there are a lot of other reasons why school uniforms are a good idea. Basically, the idea is to promote better learning by using uniforms as a tool.
