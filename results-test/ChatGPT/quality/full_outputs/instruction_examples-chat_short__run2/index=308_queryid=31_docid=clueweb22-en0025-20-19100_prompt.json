Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Obesity

Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health measured by body mass index (BMI).1 Currently, one-third (37.7%) of US adults are considered to have obesity and are at an increased risk of obesity-related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.2,3 

Given the significantly increased morbidity and mortality associated with obesity, the American Medical Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the FDA, and the World Health Organization have recognized obesity as a disease. This recognition is based on the criteria that it impairs the normal functioning of some aspects of the body, has characteristic signs or symptoms, and results in harm or morbidity.4-7 

Maintaining weight loss has been demonstrated to improve obesity-related comorbidities. The benefits of a 5% to 10% weight loss include reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes, reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, improvements in the blood lipid profile, and improvements in blood pressure.4

However, scientific evidence has shown that that physiological responses to intentional weight loss trigger weight regain. Weight loss in people with obesity causes changes in appetite hormones that actually increase hunger and the desire to eat for at least a one-year period following a reduction in weight. Hormones such as ghrelin, GLP-1, PYY, CCK, insulin, and leptin among others play an important role in appetite regulation. Long-term intervention is often required, and physician-initiated discussions can motivate patients to achieve significant and maintained weight loss.8-13
