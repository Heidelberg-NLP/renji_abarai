Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

How Much Does It Cost to Purchase an Electronic Voting Machine?

General Reference (not clearly pro or con)

The State of Texas Elections Division, in testimony given by Ann McGeehan, Director of Elections, explained at the July 28, 2005 public hearing of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission:

“Each DRE costs between $2,500 and $3,500 and represents a major economic investment.”

July 28, 2005 - State of Texas Elections Division

Ellen Theisen, CEO of the Vote-PAD Company, wrote in her 2005 report “Myth Breakers: Facts About Electronic Elections”:

“Ohio has signed contracts with Election Systems and Software [ES&S], Diebold Election Systems, and Maximus/Hart Intercivic/DFM Associates to provide voting equipment for the state… In the contracts, the vendors agreed to sell their products to Ohio at the lowest prices in the nation and with the best warranty, service, and maintenance terms… The contracts call for the prices for each machine: Diebold AccuVote-TS – $2,964; ES&S iVotronics – $2,896; Hart Intercivic eSlate 3000 – $2,997…

San Diego County paid approximately $3,040 per Diebold DRE, to include a printer…

Purchasing 16,000 machines for $55.6 million, Maryland paid approximately $3,475 per Diebold DRE, not including a printer.”

The Verified Voting Foundation submitted comments on Oct. 8, 2004 to Connecticut Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz regarding the implementation of Connecticut’s HAVA State Plan, which stated:

“The average cost of a typical DRE voting machine is about $3,500 (which includes its own fold-up voting booth) and the cost of a disabled-accessible (i.e., audio-equipped) voter-verified paper ballot printer could add as much as $1,000, for a maximum combined cost of approximately $4,500 per voting station.”

The Hutchinson News ran an article on Aug. 1, 2006 titled “Rice County On Voting Edge,” in which Clara Kilbourn wrote:

“The county’s [Rice County, Kansas] 18 new electronic voting machines, purchased at a cost of $3,200 each, will be used for the first time Tuesday in the primary election.”
