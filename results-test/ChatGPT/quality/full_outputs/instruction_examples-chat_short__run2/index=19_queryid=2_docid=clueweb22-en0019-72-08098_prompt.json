Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

We have broken into the vaping industry with five physical locations across Australia. These sites include locations in Drummoyne, Belmore, Campbelltown, Neutral Bay, and Dee Why. Though House of Vape put its mark on the industry with its physical stores, the vape store legends have branched into an all-in-one online store. If you live in Australia but aren't close enough to a store or don't have time to visit a location, House of Vape's online store is the place to go.

Why House of Vape Is Better Than the Competition

Deciding to switch to a new vape shop can be frightening and hard. Change is never easy! However, House of Vape ensures you will get whatever you need to ‚Äúhave a happy vaping.‚Äù

What Makes Their Products So Great?

On the surface, House of Vape may seem like the everyday vape shop you see on every corner nowadays. However, we can easily get lost amongst all the others if you aren't up to date on all the great things House of Vape has to offer.

House of Vape is so much more than your average shop. We carry a larger line of products making it easy to find what you need and try new things if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous. In addition, House of Vape offers extensive customer support options and has glowing reviews, unlike any other store.

Many people have given House of Vape a five-star review on Google, stating that we provide an easy experience with great prices and a knowledgeable team of vape experts at your disposal. One reviewer even named an employee a "Vape Wizard." Our team at House of Vape knows their stuff to ensure high-quality products with great customer service.

The site even offers a chatbot to ask any questions that might arise while browsing the extensive collection. House of Vape is transparent with its prices and its shipping.

Finally, House of Vape has made it our mission to ensure customers are always getting the best and latest trends for vaping. Our company ensures it's up to date on the latest trends, with teams of experts always on the hunt for the newest and best products on the e-cigarette market.
