Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Summary:

This paper will examine the use of animals in toxicology testing. It begins with an examination of the most commons tests performed on animals within the commercial products industry. Next, the paper delves into the controversy and debate surrounding animal testing, and whether such a practice actually determines the safety of a product. In addition, the paper will examine and analyze existing laws that regulate animal testing and the federal agencies that manage the safety of commercial products. Last, some alternatives to animal testing are revealed and the future of animal testing is discussed.

 

I. Introduction

Commercial products are tested on animals to ensure product safety for consumers.   The marketing of drugs, cosmetics, pesticides, food additives, and many other commercial products that could potentially be dangerous or hazardous to human health and/or the environment is controlled by regulations and laws.   These regulations and laws were created to allow for the testing of animals in laboratories in order to determine whether the benefits of a particular substance outweigh its potential harms.   Within the United States, manufacturers of commercial products are responsible for ensuring product safety for consumers.   Kelly R. McNeal, Death: The Price of Beauty: Animal Testing and the Cosmetics Industry , American Bar Association Section of Environment, Energy and Resources, Law Student Division, Spring 2005, http://www.abanet.org/environ/committees/lawstudents/pdf/mcneal.pdf.

Furthermore, companies test commercial products and substances on animals to identify hazards and determine any adverse effects that may result from exposure to such commercial products and substances.   Stacy E. Gillespie, A Cover-Girl Face does not have to begin with Animal Cruelty: Chapter 476 gives Legal Force to Alternative Testing Methods , 32 McGeorge L. Rev. 461, 461 (2001).   This is also known as toxicology testing, and is defined as the “study of substances that are harmful or ‘toxic’ to living creatures.”   Toxicology tests “identify hazards, determine adverse effects that will ensue from exposure to chemicals, and provide data estimating the quantitative exposure-response relationship for chemicals.”   Id. at 463.   During toxicology testing, tests can either be limited or short-term where exposure is acute or toxicology testing can be long-term where exposure to a chemical is chronic.   Id.   Regardless of the length of testing, toxicology tests measure the impact of chemical exposure on the health and mortality of animals.   In theory, animal reactions to chemicals and commercial products emulate and represent the reactions of such on people.  

This paper will examine the use of animals in toxicology testing.   It begins with an examination of the most commons tests performed on animals within the commercial products industry.   Next, the paper delves into the controversy and debate surrounding animal testing, and whether such a practice actually determines the safety of a product.   In addition, the paper will examine and analyze existing laws that regulate animal testing and the federal agencies that manage the safety of commercial products.   Last, some alternatives to animal testing are revealed and the future of animal testing is discussed.

II. History of Animal Testing in Consumer Products

Companies test commercial products on animals in a variety of ways.   While animal testing was originally developed because of the use of animals in biomedical research, toxicology testing has become much more important.   In the 20 th century, toxicology testing became vital to the safety of consumers as a number of companies began to sell products that were considered harmful or resulted in unforeseen side effects.   For example, animal testing fully emerged in 1933 when a number of women went blind after applying mascara.   See McNeal .   Soon thereafter, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to protect consumers from unsafe or harmful commercial products.   Id.   Also, the expanding knowledge and development of chemicals used in commercial products led to a perceived need for animal testing.   Two of the most commonly used methods of testing on animals include the Draize Eye-Irritancy Test and the Lethal Dose 50 Test.

A. The Draize Eye-Irritancy Test

The Draize Eye-Irritancy Test (Draize Test) was created by a toxicologist for the Federal Drug Association (FDA) in 1944.   32 McGeorge L. Rev. 461, 464.   Originally, the Draize Test was intended to detect the potential harmfulness of a wide range of substances and products that could potentially come into contact with the human eye including, but not limited to, cosmetics, household products, industrial products, and possible chemical welfare agents.   This particular test is almost exclusively performed upon rabbits.   Traditionally, the rabbits are locked into holding devices with only their heads exposed.   Ultimately, this method of strict confinement prevents the animals from scratching, clawing at eyes, or escaping.   Id.   Some common reactions observed after Draize testing include, but are not limited to: swollen eyelids, bleeding, swollen or inflammation of the iris, hemorrhaging, massive deterioration, ulceration or perforation of the cornea, and blindness.   See McNeal.   Since a great deal of those who perform these experiments believe anesthesia or pain relieving drugs interfere with test results, many animals are forced to “break their necks or backs in an effort to escape.”   Id.

B. The Lethal Dose 50 Test     

Another less commonly used method of animal testing is the Lethal Dose 50 Test (LD50).   The LD50 Test is an experiment in which an animal is given a “dosage of the tested chemical necessary to kill fifty percent of the test animals.”   32 McGeorge L. Rev. 461, 465.   Oftentimes, the LD50 Test is used on rats or mice.   See McNeal .   The LD50 Test “involves placing chemicals on the animals’ raw, shaved skin and covering the skin with adhesive plaster.”   Tested animals may suffer from “irritated or inflamed skin, bleeding, or bloody scabs.”   Other more severe side effects that animals may suffer as a result of the LD50 Test include, but are not limited to: “severe abdominal pain, muscle cramps, convulsions, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal ulcers with bleeding, loss of kidney functioning, and other painful or distressing conditions.”   Id.   The LD50 Test aids federal regulators by determining the proper safety precautions necessary in order to ensure adequate product manufacturing, transport, use and disposal.   32 McGeorge L. Rev. 461, 465.   Historically, the LD50 Test was one of the first animal testing methods used to determine the toxicity of a chemical or product.   See McNeal .

Despite the fact that the LD50 Test may test chemicals or products that are not very toxic, injury or death may occur from other complications involved during the testing process, including death from the sheer volume of chemical or product forced into an animal’s system.   Id.   While the LD50 Test is not as widely used as it once was, this method of testing still occurs but usually with a fewer number of animals being tested.   32 McGeorge L. Rev. 461, 465.   Ironically, any animals that survive the LD50 Test are immediately euthanized while the tissues of all the other animals involved are examined pathologically.   See McNeal .

C. What Constitutes “Animal Testing”

When testing cosmetics on animals, all of the following practices are included:

(1) testing a finished cosmetic product on animals; (2) testing individual ingredients of cosmetic products on animals; (3) testing any combination of ingredients on animals; (4) contracting a third-party company to perform any of the above tests; or (5) using a subsidiary or third-party company to perform any of the above tests in countries where animal testing is not banned.  

See McNeal .   As such, animal testing not only includes the direct testing performed by the commercial product manufacturers, but also consists of any testing on animals that has been contracted out to third-party companies.   Clearly, some companies form contracts with third-party entities to perform testing on animals so as to avoid any direct association with the practice of testing on animals.   Id.   One perceived reason companies do this is to circumvent any involvement with animal testing, so consumers are kept in the dark as to the fact that some consumer products are tested on animals.
