Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

PUBLISHED: | UPDATED:

Hoping to continue curbing the spread of COVID-19, the Alameda County Department of Public Health has issued a new order requiring all first responders to be fully vaccinated against the virus by Dec. 21, or submit to weekly testing.

The order, issued Tuesday, applies to all police officers, firefighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and anyone whose work requires them to enter “high-risk health care facilities” such as hospitals, nursing facilities, or those who are involved with both emergency and non-emergency medical transports in Alameda County.

“Due to the nature of their professions, these workers are at high risk for spreading COVID-19 to patients in their care, to older and medically vulnerable residents, and to staff at these health care settings,” the health department said in a written statement.

Any workers not fully vaccinated by the deadline must continue to wear masks “while in the presence of patients or residents and must test for COVID-19 weekly,” the statement said.

“COVID-19 vaccines are proven to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness and death,” the county health department statement said.

“While a fully vaccinated person may contract the virus that causes COVID-19, vaccinated persons are less likely to be infected and those who do test positive for COVID are infectious for a shorter time, reducing the chances that a vaccinated person will spread the virus to others,” it said.

The order does not require a booster shot. A one-dose vaccination of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine or a two-dose vaccination of the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccines is required to be completed by the deadline. Those who are not fully vaccinated must submit weekly proof of testing and continue to wear masks when interacting with the public.

The order also allows for exemptions from the mandate for those who can prove a “sincerely held religious belief or qualifying medical reason.”

For some agencies in Alameda County, the mandate will be a new policy to adhere to, while for others, it likely won’t change much. In Oakland, for example, all city employees must report their vaccination status to the city by Nov. 15, and be fully vaccinated by Nov. 29.

For the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, testing of all unvaccinated employees has already been happening weekly for over a year, according to Sgt. Ray Kelly.

Currently, Kelly said, about 55% of sheriff’s office employees have reported themselves as fully vaccinated. The other 45% may include some people who are vaccinated but choose not to provide information of their vaccination status, and continue to be tested weekly.

“The sheriff supports the vaccine, recommends the vaccine, and has encouraged his staff to voluntarily take the vaccine, but he is also mindful and sensitive to some of the individuals who have vaccine hesitancy,” Kelly said of Sheriff Greg Ahern. “It’s a very contentious subject.

“There are certain people in the first responder group who just don’t feel they should be told they have to get the vaccine, and I know that’s controversial,” he said. Overall, he added,  “the public sentiment and public comment is overwhelming; it’s very loud that they want their first responders vaccinated.”

A representative for the Alameda County Fire Department said Wednesday afternoon that the agency was still reviewing the health order and declined to comment on it.

The union for Alameda County Fire Department firefighters, IAFF Local 55, posted a letter earlier this year on its social media channels opposing strict vaccine mandates that impose termination. Union representatives could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon.

County health officials declined to answer in detail questions about how the rules of the order were established, including why leaders may have decided not to issue a stricter mandate.

Health department representative Neetu Balram said while preparing the health order, the department discussed it “with various stakeholders, including all first responder agencies and cities.”

Balram said there is “no plan to amend or update the current order at this time” to be stricter, but noted that any employers in the county can choose to impose stricter vaccine mandates that don’t allow for a testing and masking option.

Santa Clara County provides an example of how that might work: In San Jose, workers who did not obtain an approved exemption and were not fully vaccinated or in the process of becoming vaccinated at the end of a grace period in October were subject to being suspended for a week, before returning to work with required twice-weekly testing.

As of last week, 95% of San Jose employees overall, including 92% of police officers, reported being fully vaccinated.

Kelly said based on what the sheriff’s department has seen happen in other first responder agencies around the country, if stricter mandates are imposed, most employees will likely get vaccinated.

“When it comes down to the wire, and it comes down to you’re going to be terminated or lose your job as a result of this, pretty much all people take the vaccine,” he said.
