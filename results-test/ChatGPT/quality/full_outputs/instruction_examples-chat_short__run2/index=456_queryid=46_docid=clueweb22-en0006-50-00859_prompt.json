Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Net Neutrality Legislation in States

Heather Morton 1/23/2019

After the Federal Communications Commission Restoring Internet Freedom Order and transparency rule amendments became effective June 11, 2018, overturning earlier requirements on net neutrality requirements on internet service providers, state legislators responded by introducing net neutrality legislation at the state level.

Net neutrality is the concept that all data traffic on a network should be treated indiscriminately, where internet service providers (ISPs) would be restricted from blocking, slowing down or speeding up the delivery of online content at their discretion. The current debate surrounding net neutrality is principally about how ISPs should be regulated and what role government should play in overseeing their network management practices.

The rule change places primary jurisdiction over internet service providers’ network management practices under the Federal Trade Commission and preempts states from enacting similar ISP network restrictions as found in the 2015 Open Internet Order.

Attorneys general from 22 states filed a protective petition for review against the FCC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia introduced 120 bills and resolutions regarding net neutrality in the 2018 legislative session. Five states—California, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont and Washington—enacted legislation or adopted resolutions. California enacted the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018. This act prohibits fixed and mobile internet service providers, as defined, that provide broadband internet access service, as defined, from engaging in specified actions concerning the treatment of internet traffic. In a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, California agreed to not enforce its net neutrality law until the lawsuit challenging the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of the federal regulations is resolved. In addition, California adopted a resolution urging the FCC to reinstate the 2015 Open Internet Order and urging the U.S. Congress to intervene to protect net neutrality and codify its principles in statute.

New Jersey adopted a resolution urging the President and Congress of United States to restore “net neutrality” in federal law. Oregon prohibited public bodies from contracting with broadband Internet access service providers that engage in certain network management activities based on paid prioritization, content blocking or other discrimination.

Vermont required an internet service provider to certify that it is in compliance with consumer protection and net neutrality standards in order to be eligible to receive a government contract for internet service beginning April 15, 2019 or the date on which the governor’s Executive Order No. 2-18 (internet neutrality in state procurement) is revoked and rescinded, whichever is earlier. The act also required the attorney general to review the network management practices of ISPs in Vermont and determine whether they are in compliance with the 2015 FCC net neutrality rules and to disclose those findings on a publicly available website.

Washington required a person providing broadband internet access service in the state to publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of its services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of the services and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings. Further, the law prohibits a person engaged in the provision of broadband internet access service in the state from: (1) Blocking lawful content, applications, services, or nonharmful devices; (2) Impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of internet content, application, or service, or use of a nonharmful device; or (3) Engaging in paid prioritization.

Separately, legislators have introduced measures that would restrict ISPs’ use of customer information and adopt privacy protections. For example, two states, Nevada and Minnesota prohibit disclosure of personally identifying information, but Minnesota also requires ISPs to get permission from subscribers before disclosing information about the subscribers' online surfing habits and internet sites visited.
