Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is obesity a disease? | Debate.org
  • Obesity is a disease

    Obesity is a health issue that can lead to heart failure and diabetes. It can be treated with operations or medicine, so I would classify it as a disease. It is curable, but it plagues millions of Americans. It is an epidemic and it must be treated. It is self inflicted, and it can be fixed.

  • Obesity is spreading

    Every day, more and more people are becoming obese, just as a flu (which is a disease) also spreads. Do you know how bad this is? More and more children are becoming obese, and if you do not treat it as a disease, obesity will spread faster. It is horrible seeing the diseases that are lead by obesity such as heart disease, high blood pressure, cholesterol etc. If you don’t treat it as a disease, who will?

  • It is! (for people from cls lmao)

    Obesity is more than just an addiction to food or poor eating habits. It's when you take overweight to the next level and it harms your health. Obesity is dangerous since it can lead to diseases or even death. You can get type two diabetes, cancer, heart disease or strokes!

  • Debate: Is obesity a disease? Yes.

    We have all seen people who look obese. Many people say that they are infected with a disease. But, are they really? Obesity is a disease. Surprisingly, a very common one. An American study proved that obesity has officially been recognised as a disease. Obesity is not only widespread, but it's become a real health risk. Obesity has many side effects and causes many health problems like cancer, high blood pressure and gout. I think that as common as obesity is, it is as easy to evade. Looking after our health is very important and having proper nutrition for a certain age is vital. I

  • Obesity, despite being avoidable, is still a disease.

    The definition of disease is a "disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury." So it applies to the obesity epidemic perfectly. All the arguments against this seem to be suggesting that because obesity is sometimes avoidable, then it can't be a disease, which is bs.

  • Fits definition of a disease

    A disease is defined as "a disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific signs or symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury." Obesity causes incredible stress on the joint and body, leading to cardiovascular issues, sleep apnea, and even decreasing one's lifespan. As it impairs the function of the body, and can at times be caused by genetic factors, it is a disease.

  • Obesity is a disease

    A disease is generally thought of as an abnormal state, or a condition that prevents the body from functioning properly.

    Obesity is a disease because it impairs the functions of a normal body b/c excessive fat tissue causes the overproduction of molecules that can lead to abnormal food intake. Just as diabetes results from the body’s inability to regulate blood sugar, obesity results from the body’s inability to regulate energy balance.

  • Obesity is not a disease

    Functions of our body is natural and not considered a "disease" if everything is functioning, But diseases are brought as the RESULT of obesity and poor eating habits because the body is taking in the toxins and fats we consider abnormal to our body, So my thesis statement is the Obesity is the Cause of Diseases and not the diseases itself

  • No its not

    Bruh like lmao who tf really thinks fat is a disease? That stupid fr!! All you gotta do is eat gud considering that diet is 75 persent of the problem! Get off your butt and do some exercise silly! Being fat may be an epidemic but so is being lazy!

  • No it is not!

    Obesity is not a disease, because just because your fat does not mean I have a disease it just means I need to lose weight. Obesity is not really a bad thing it's just an alert that you need to calm down on all the food your eating and watch what your eating and drinking.

  • It is NOT

    I have been obese all my life. I consider myself healthy. I eat healthy, I work out and I'm not lazy. The people who decide that its a disease can shove it. We are all different. I don't know why most jerks can't accept that. It's time to stop and move on to another important subject.

  • A Genetic Condition but Not a Disease

    Scientists, even today, do not classify obesity as a disease but, rather, as a factor that leads to diseases, such as diabetes. In other words, obesity is more of a path to diseases and not a disease but a condition that can be controlled. Genetics, of course, play a big role in obesity but so do the environmental experiences, including the diet the kid or adult chooses.

  • No One Force Feeds an Adult

    Obesity can be controlled with a well-balanced diet. If someone eats the same greasy diet of burgers, pizza and beer everyday, then of course obesity will be a problem. An obese person means something is out of whack in their body. Having the body's digestive system go crazy means something must be fixed before it is too late.

  • No, obesity is more related to poor self-control and poor eating habits

    I do not feel that obesity is a disease, but rather a condition brought about by poor eating habits and poor self-control. While obesity is, in some instances, a result of a genetic condition or side-effect from a different illness, it is usually caused by a lack of exercise combined with an unhealthy diet.

  • No

    It is an addiction. I am overweight, and I am/was addicted to food. Food is very addicting to many people, and with the inclusion of a soda, it can be extempore pleasurable. Why do I like sex? It feels good. Why do people like tobacco and alcohol? It feels good. Eating food feels good. It is an addiction.
