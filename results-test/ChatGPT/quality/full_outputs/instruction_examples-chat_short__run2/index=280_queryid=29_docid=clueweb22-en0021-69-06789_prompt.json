Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

This would not have been possible if it weren’t for the many immigrants, who come here in search of a better life. As of lately though, there has been much controversy over whether or not we should allow those who come here illegally to be granted amnesty. As a daughter of immigrant parents, I know first hand about how dedicated immigrants are, and the difficulties it would cause to send them back to their former country. Illegal immigrants should be allowed to become citizens. Not only do they boost our economy greatly, they cost too much money to deport, and they take the jobs that many of us don’t. It is important that we allow legalization for the illegal immigrants that come to this country because it benefits our economy, it is too expensive to deport them, and they are responsible for many of our labor intensive and unwanted jobs. To begin with, granting illegal immigrants with citizenship will boost our economy. “Legal status would boost the economy, but the resulting productivity and wage gains would be much…show more content…

In total, the cost of deporting illegal immigrants back to their countries would cost taxpayers $285 billion.” This means that our taxes would increase greatly if we spent our money on deporting illegal immigrants. That money could go to providing health care, or supplies for schools. Most immigrants have lived here long enough to have built a family, and spending our taxes to rip these homes apart is simply inhumane. As you can see, deporting immigrants is too expensive, and in addition, breaks families
