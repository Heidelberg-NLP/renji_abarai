Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

David Sedaris: Gay Marriage Should Be Legal, But Gay People Shouldn't Marry (VIDEO)

The bestselling author and contributor to "This American Life," who has written extensively about what it was like to grow up as a gay person in North Carolina, shared his surprising reason for not wanting gay people to tie the knot on "George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight" last week.

"See, I wish that gay marriage would be legal everywhere, but that no gay people would act on it. because, look. nobody wants to go to anybody's wedding," Sedaris said. "Nobody wants to get on a plane, go halfway across the country, and wear clothes that they don't feel comfortable in, and choose between the beef and the chicken, and sit in a loud room where a horrible band is playing way too loud, and they're getting their picture taken ... nobody wants that."

As the summer wedding season draws to a close, with its myriad expenses and demands on time, we can see where he's coming from.

Sedaris was on the show to promote his new book "Let’s Explore Diabetes With Owls," another collection of the satirist's trademark essays (you can see the full interview here).

One piece in the new book, highlighted in The New York Times review, features a monologue from a straight man who is outraged about New York State legalizing gay marriage. He's so mad he starts killing his own offspring, with a ridiculous explanation.

“The high jinks in New York made a sham of my marriage, so it logically made the fruits of that marriage meaningless as well,” the fictional man says about shooting his daughter.

The man subsequently ends up in jail with an undocumented Hispanic cellmate, and the monologue ends with an unforgettable line: “I’m here to tell you that, as long as you keep your eyes shut, it’s really not that bad.”

Sedaris has lived in France and the U.K., where gay marriage is legal, but has yet to wed his partner Hugh Hamrick. Sedaris told The Daily Beast in 2008 that they are the type of couple that lives together but will never marry, while joking he would do anything to save money.

No better way to do that than to skip the wedding.

"George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight" airs weeknights at 7 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on CBC Television. You can follow George on the web, Twitter and Facebook.
