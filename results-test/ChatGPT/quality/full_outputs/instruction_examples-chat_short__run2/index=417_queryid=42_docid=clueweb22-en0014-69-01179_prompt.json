Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Winnipeg Jets and Manitoba Moose launch Hockey Fights Cancer campaigns

Jets celebrate 10th campaign; Moose will unveil first-ever HFC jersey

by Winnipeg Jets PR @WpgJetsPR / Press Release
November 1, 2021

WINNIPEG, Nov. 1, 2021 - After highlighting their Hockey Fights Cancer (HFC) campaigns through digital platforms in 2020, the Winnipeg Jets and Manitoba Moose will again raise funds and awareness in-game for the 2021 campaigns during the month of November, leading up to the teams' respective HFC games - Nov. 21 for the Moose, and Nov. 22 for the Jets.

The Winnipeg Jets mark their 10th season as part of the NHL's league-wide HFC initiative with fans having generously donated more than $865,000 to CancerCare Manitoba Foundation (CCMF) and their pediatric clinical trials, which allow young cancer patients to receive life-saving treatments close to home. 

The Manitoba Moose celebrate their third season of running their own HFC campaign by introducing their first-ever HFC jersey, which players will wear for the duration of the game, and continuing their support for Camp Quality Manitoba, a charitable organization that provides camp experiences to children affected by cancer and blood disorders.

Jets and Moose fans will have the opportunity to give all month long through the purchase of raffle tickets from Nov. 1-22 for the chance to win one of eight Jets warm-up-worn/issued HFC jerseys. Raffle tickets will be sold digitally for the first time, giving fans the chance to purchase them both at games and at home. Fans can buy one raffle ticket for $5, three tickets for $10, 10 tickets for $20, or 50 tickets for $50 at TNYFRaffle.com.

Leading up to the Nov. 22 HFC game in November, the Jets will also sell mystery autographed pucks and mini sticks on the concourse. Among the mystery pucks will be four "super pucks" which will provide the added bonus of tickets to a future Jets game. Moose fans will have the chance to buy Moose mystery signed pucks on the concourse as well at Moose games on Nov. 18, 19, and at the HFC game on Nov. 21. One super puck will be in the mix, with the lucky winner receiving an autographed 2019-20 game-issued Kyle Connor Winnipeg Jets lavender HFC jersey. 

The campaigns culminate at the HFC games Nov. 21 and 22. The Jets will welcome this year's four CCMF child ambassadors to the ice for a special pre-game ceremony. All four ambassadors have inspiring stories, which will be shared at WinnipegJets.com throughout the month of November. The team will bring back the lavender rink boards and in-game visual media as in past years, and the evening's 50/50 proceeds will also go toward the cause. Jets players will show their support by donning HFC ties as they arrive at Canada Life Centre and will wear special HFC jerseys during the pre-game warm-up. Jets coaches and broadcasters will join them in wearing the HFC ties throughout the game.

The special Manitoba Moose jerseys will feature the signature lavender colour of the HFC campaigns and will be worn by players for the duration of the game with a select number of those jerseys being available for auction on the concourse. The jerseys will be the centrepiece of a variety of awareness initiatives that night, including lavender rink boards and gameday presentation visuals. The Moose will also welcome Camp Quality Manitoba representatives to the ice at their HFC game for a pre-game ceremony and will share stories of the impact of Camp Quality on youth who are battling childhood cancer at MooseHockey.com leading up to the game. Jersey unveil details to come via Manitoba Moose social channels - @ManitobaMoose.

Following the games, the remainder of the Moose HFC jerseys, warm-up-worn and issued Jets HFC jerseys, specially designed HFC goalie masks worn by Jets and Moose goaltenders, player-worn HFC ties, and game-used and issued lavender-taped sticks will be available for auction at Auctions.NHL.com from Nov. 25 to Dec. 8 at 8 p.m. 

Official HFC merchandise is available now at all five Winnipeg Jets Gear stores, with a portion of the proceeds going toward Hockey Fights Cancer. 

More details regarding the Jets HFC campaign can be found at WinnipegJets.com/HFC

Don't miss out on the Jets and Moose HFC games on Nov. 21 and 22 and your chance to join the fight against cancer by getting your tickets to each game at WinnipegJets.com/TICKETS and MooseHockey.com/TICKETS.

Hellebuyck back to 100 percent, Jets prepare to face Colorado

Sanford won't play against Avalanche; Schmidt a game-time decision

April 23, 2022

WINNIPEG - For the first time since April 7, the Winnipeg Jets hit the ice for practice at Canada Life Centre on Saturday as they prepare for the final home stand of the season.

When that home stand begins on Sunday against the Colorado Avalanche, the Jets will be trying to get back in the win column following four consecutive losses on the road to Eastern Conference powerhouses in Florida, Tampa Bay, New York, and Carolina.

The 4-2 loss to the Hurricanes marked the first time this season the Jets lost in regulation when leading after two periods.

"Carolina is the number-one goal differential team in the third period. You look at the teams we're playing, they're good teams. They do come back and win games," said Jets interim head coach Dave Lowry.

"Statistically it's on our side. We didn't get the outcome, we didn't win games, but it wasn't just due to the third period."

Jets start strong in Carolina, but fall to Hurricanes to end road trip

When you don't win hockey games, disappointment will resonate."

by Mitchell Clinton @MitchellClinton / WinnipegJets.com
April 21, 2022

RALEIGH - A frustrating road trip came to an even more frustrating end for the Winnipeg Jets on Thursday night.

The Jets, already with three losses on the trip, held leads of 2-0 and 2-1 over the Carolina Hurricanes at PNC Arena, but couldn't hang on as they ultimately fell by a score of 4-2.

"We're in the business to win hockey games. When you don't win hockey games, disappointment will resonate," said Jets interim head coach Dave Lowry. "These guys care, and that's the biggest thing. And when you lose, you don't like to lose."

Eric Comrie, making his second consecutive start, was sensational in goal once again. He made 42 saves on the 45 shots he faced. 

"He's been outstanding and he's given us an opportunity to win hockey games," said Jets Lowry. "He's been very confident in the net, he's been very poised, and that's something that our team plays well when Eric is in the net. They are confident in the goaltender."

Thomas' Five Storylines - WPG @ CAR

The Comrie encore, Samberg jumps in, and more!

COMRIE ENCORE

With Connor Hellebuyck still dealing with a non-COVID illness, Eric Comrie will start again tonight against the Hurricanes. Comrie was outstanding in the Jets loss against the Rangers on Tuesday night stopping 31 of the 33 shots he faced. Comrie has a .927 save percentage in his past three outings, to improve his season goals-against average to .914. Comrie has never faced the Hurricanes before in his NHL career. Mikhail Berdin will serve as Comrie's back up this evening.

SAMBERG IN

Dylan Samberg will return to the Jets lineup and will replace Logan Stanley on the teams third defence pairing. Stanley played the last two games for the Jets and played only 11:20 Tuesday night in New York. Samberg had a challenging game when the Jets were in Sunrise, Florida facing the Panthers. The 23-year-old was a -2, had two hits in 14:35 of ice time. Samberg will pair up with Brendan Dillon tonight against the Hurricanes.

Morning Skate Report: Jets at Hurricanes

RALEIGH - Since returning from the National Hockey League All-Star break, the Winnipeg Jets have been doing all they can to claw back into a wildcard spot, but despite getting within a couple points on more than one occasion, they couldn't get over the hump.

Ahead of Thursday's road trip finale in Carolina, the Jets were officially eliminated from the Stanley Cup Playoffs, marking the first time they've missed the postseason since 2016-17.

"We're extremely disappointed," said Jets interim head coach Dave Lowry. "This team had a goal and that was to compete for the Stanley Cup. When you fall short, obviously there is disappointment."

The challenge now for the Jets (35-31-11) is to make the most of the final five games of the regular season. This won't be a five-game stretch where the Jets go through the motions - the games are too important for that.
