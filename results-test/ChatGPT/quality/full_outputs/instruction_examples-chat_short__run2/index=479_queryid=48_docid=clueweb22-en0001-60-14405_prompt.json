Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

After a debate on Votes at 16 was filibustered out of a vote, here are three reasons not to support lowering the voting age.

As Conservative ex-chancellor George Osborne joined the campaign to lower the voting age in the UK to 16, many thought that the tides were turning. However, Tory MPs filibustered the debate – speaking for too long to allow a vote, as Labour MPs shouted ‘shame’ across the chamber. The Deputy Speaker even had to wade in, exclaiming that he wasn’t at a football match. So why shouldn’t we be supporting votes at 16?

16 year olds don’t know enough about politics

This is a sweeping generalisation, of course,e but one I’m sure the majority can attest to. I certainly know that at 16, I didn’t have enough knowledge about politics to vote responsibly. The problem here is a lack of political education, and this is something that should certainly be addressed before MPs try to force through virtue signalling bills.

16 year olds are more easily influenced by parents and guardians

This point ties in with the first – a general lack of political knowledge means any debates with family or friends can easily tip you one way or the other with your vote. Technically, in many cases, parents to 16 year olds may be handed an ‘extra vote’ in cases where their child isn’t politically savvy, undermining democratic principles. 

16 year olds can’t do everything politicians tell you they can

Yes, they can join the army – but not as frontline soldiers and with parental permission. Yes, they can marry their MP… if their parents give permission. 16 year olds don’t pay tax, they can’t drink, they can’t go into nightclubs. Politicians and votes at 16 campaigners will tell you that 16 year olds can do EVERYTHING but vote. This isn’t true.
