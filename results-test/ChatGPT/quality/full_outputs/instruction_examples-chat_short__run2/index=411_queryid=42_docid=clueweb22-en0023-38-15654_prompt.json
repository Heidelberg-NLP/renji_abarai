Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Why Hockey Should Ban Fighting

This article is more than 6 years old.

The Toronto Globe and Mail recently ran a story on Robert Frid. Frid fought hundreds of times over three years of junior hockey and eight seasons in the minor leagues. He’s had at least 75 concussions and was knocked unconscious many times. Declared permanently disabled in his 30s, Frid, now 41, doesn’t think he has much time left.

The misery he endured in his hockey career raises a very simple question: Isn’t it well past time for professional hockey at all levels to ban fighting?

Frid is most likely suffering brain damage from all the hits he took. His long-term memory is poor. He has anxiety disorder and headaches and, the story reports, says he usually can’t sleep through the night.

Frid is hardly alone. From Derek Boogaard to Wade Belak to Todd Ewan, a long series of pro-hockey enforcers have left a legacy of depression, pain and suicides. Can these problems all be attributed to taking blows to the head during fights? Who knows? But hockey ought to care. Fighting has no place in hockey.

And before the whining about wussification of everything begins, save it. Why should any sport allow fights among players? Entertainment? Well, it was once held that fans would not tolerate helmets. Hell, some once argued that fans would not tolerate face masks on goalies! Who cares what fans think? It isn’t their heads getting beaten on for years. They don’t have to live with the reality of depression and suicide.

Fights among players, whether "enforcers" or stars, whether in the lower minors or the NHL, ought to be against the rules. Drop your gloves, take a swing and you are gone for the rest of the game.

Some will say the Robert Frids of the world would have no hockey career were fighting banned. The correct answer is to that statement is--good. If you lack true hockey skills you don’t belong on a roster any more than a bar-room brawler belongs on a baseball squad or a martial arts master on a women’s softball team. If you can’t play at a pro level than even if you are willing to get your brains beat in for a paycheck and even if some fans delight in the blood, you need to find another line of work.

The NHL and other pro leagues should not indulge thuggery any more. It comes at too high a price and shows indifference to those who are asked to get hurt by make brawling part of the game. It is time to do the right thing and get the goonery gone.
