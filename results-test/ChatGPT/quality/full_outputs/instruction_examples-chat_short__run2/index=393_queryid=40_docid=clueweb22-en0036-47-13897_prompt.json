Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should rape constitute the death penalty? | Debate.org
  • My painful experience

    I think rape should be considered murder. I have been raped before when I was ten years old.. The memory.. Just thinking about it makes me cry. I have to deal with the painful memories every day, it is even hard for me to be alone with anyone for more than 5 minutes, or I start to panic. Arresting rapists isn't enough, you are just basically giving them a pass, letting them being able to go back out into the world and raping some other innocent girl, who is not provoking anyone. People say "oh it's their clothes provoking them." Well I always wore long sleeves and jeans, no showing any skin and yet my clothes provoked me to get raped?! Really? Maybe if you knew what it was like, maybe you would understand.

  • Rape is another high level of Murder.

    What is the punishment of a murderer ? I believe you would say death penalty. Because ones life is taken away. But Rape is another high level of murder, where you just don't physically Assault but emotionally, spiritually and innerly demolish the victim. And what if You or your sister or even your Mother get raped or any close relative? I know You even can't think of that. You would %100 say that He should put to death. You will not say that, I will kindly advice or educate the Rapist that He Should have not done that.

  • A rapist does not deserve to live. Not with ease.

    Rapist know what they're doing. They know exactly what they are doing. It's a fun game to them.
    So, does someone who is that psychotic and insane in membrain. ..Who gets off on putting innocent people through such inhuman pain... Do they really deserve to live another day breathing the same air as we all breath...

  • Kill them all

    I would first like to state my definitions of rape and violence.
    Rape is using violent force to violate another human beings freedom to choose who they can and can not have sex with. I do not define intoxicated sex or statutory rape necessarily as rape, because some of those situations involve consensual sex. Many people choose to have sex with older people or choose to have sex while intoxicated and agreed upon consensual sex of any kind is not considered rape to me, even if others say it is not consensual.
    I have read the all of the yes and no comments and mostly agree with yes people except the ones asking for torture. I will list all of the arguments of people against capital punishment as numbers and then explain why they are all wrong in my rebuttal.

    1. The eighth amendment says that punishment for crimes should not be proportional to the severity of the crime. Rape doesn't kill people, so they shouldn't die as their punishment.

    Rebuttle: Rape kills people. Women can die of exhaustion from being raped. Women can become pregnant which can kill them. Some women kill themselves after being raped or live in fear the rest of their life. Many women are threatened with death from the perpetrator or gang members they are associated with and have to enter a witness protection program and leave their families which ruins their lives. Some women will get STD's which ruin their love lives. When your entire life is ruined and you don't enjoy living, you are not really alive anymore, you are dead on the inside. Women can have there wombs destroyed making it impossible to make babies and killing her ability to create life.

    2. Innocent people get convicted of rape and therefore we should not have the death penalty for rape.

    Rebuttal: False convictions in court are a completely separate problem from the law itself. Innocent people are convicted of all kinds of crimes. According to this logic we shouldn't have any laws, because they might get innocent people killed or in jail.

    3. These people have good intentions or are ignorant. They may be mentally unstable or desperate for sex or even have uncontrollable sexual urges. Part of them knows that they are doing something wrong, but they just can't control it. Some people rape as a spur of the moment thing that they don’t plan.

    Rebuttal: The intention of the rapist does not matter. All that matters is the consequences of their actions. It doesn't matter if you are mentally challenged and don't understand right and wrong. It doesn’t matter if you planned it ahead of time or planned it in a few moments.

    4. Giving the death penalty will encourage rapists to murder their victims so that they can not speak out against them in court and get them killed.

  • My painful experience

    You people who say no. Have you gone through the experience of raped? Do you honestly know how much it effects you afterwards? Well I do, and its horrible. It has impacted me so much, I can't even be alone in the room with someone for more than 5 minutes otherwise I have a panic attack. I thought and sometimes do think I am worthless, just a piece of crap. I tried to end my life because of that painful experience, luckily my sister saved my life. So if you have not gone through such a painful experience, then you honestly have no idea what you are talking about. So just hush up.

  • Murderers shouldn't be the only ones getting executed

    Rapists should definitely be placed on death row. I am not saying that the state should kill an entire list of suspects, but definitely execute them if they are guilty of raping someone. It sucks that the Constitution doesn't believe that rape is a crime deserving of the death penalty when clearly it is. By simply arresting a rapist, we are paying to keep those bastards alive. Rape is NOT the result of a mental illness. Rape is a CHOICE. The reason I believe that rapists should be killed is because that way, it would guarantee that they wouldn't be a threat to anyone else ever again.

  • Can't rehabilitate that mindset.

    Criminal corrections facilities are used to rehabilitate, incapacitate, or for retribution. What I mean by that is our mindset as American's is to either fix the person, pull him off the street and lock him away so he cant hurt society, or he gets what he deserves for committing that crime. A drug addict can be rehabilitated and brought back to society and have a positive effect on society. The mindset of a rapist is not something we can rehabilitate. If we are going to lock him up anyways we should focus on retribution. Instead of locking him up and wasting tax payers cash, just get rid of the parasite on society that can't be reformed.

  • I wish rape constituted the death penalty

    Rape should constitute the death penalty. Allow me to explain why. Hitler may be seen as one of the most evil men in history, but he was almost right about something. The human race is in danger of our own kind and the only way to rid ourselves from the danger is through artificial selection. However, Hitler went after the wrong people. The "bad genes" Hitler discussed that Jews have will die out through natural selection such as Tay Sachs disease. Tay Sachs has become rarer every day because of natural selection and also due to globalization, so it is safe to assume that one day that gene will die. The human race is in danger of those who lack empathy such as murderers and sex offenders. You cannot teach empathy to anyone. It is a gene which they lack. The only way to save the human race is start a Murderer and Rapist Holocaust. Natural selection favors them for their ability to survive and adapt which is why artificial selection must commence. All murderers and rapists should die. All of their children should be aborted in the womb. Empathy is a gene that must live on in order for society and the human race as we know it to stay intact. Having empathy means knowing what it means to be alive and having the ability to know what it is like in someone else's shoes. Not having the empathy gene means inadequacy. If you have empathy, you are adequate and therefore you should go forth and multiply. If you do not have empathy, you should be executed for the good of mankind. The effects of rape in particular are devastating not only to the victim, but to the world around them. Rapists are no more dangerous than murderers. They force people into exposure of diseases, impregnating women, and often beating their victims to near death all for their sick and twisted pleasure. Why would anyone think they don't deserve to die? Letting them live means we are sending all rapists a message that society accepts them. We shouldn't. That's not a society I want to live in. The Murderer/ Rapist Holocaust should commence immediately!

  • Rape can be prevented

    If the punishment is strict enough, rape can be prevented. When an evil man is feeling very sexual and has the opportunity to rape, having a strict punishment can prevent the rape from occurring. The effects of rape are very long-lasting and cause many suicide cases, therefore rape is very serious.

  • Yes they should.
