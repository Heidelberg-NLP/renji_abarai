Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

BARC: New Bleeding Definitions Aim to Standardize Trial Endpoints

New bleeding guidelines that replace terms like “major” and “minor” with a numbered hierarchy of increasing severity may mark a significant step toward standardizing bleeding endpoint definitions for cardiovascular clinical trials involving antithrombotic therapies. The guidelines appear in the June 14, 2011, issue of Circulation.

The Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC), a collaboration among academia, professional societies, and federal agencies, modeled its effort on the Academic Research Consortium, which standardized key ischemic endpoint definitions such as stent thrombosis for studies aimed at evaluating coronary stents. According to the authors, BARC arose from the need to overcome the drawbacks of the myriad bleeding definitions currently in use in clinical trials, including TIMI and GUSTO. The consensus report was written by a team led by Roxana Mehran, MD, of Mount Sinai Medical Center (New York, NY).

In brief, BARC incorporates 5 bleeding types (table 1).

Table 1. BARC Definitions

Type 0

No bleeding

Type 1

Bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek treatment

Type 2

Any clinically overt sign of hemorrhage that “is actionable” and requires diagnostic studies, hospitalization, or treatment by a health care professional

Type 3

a.       Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to < 5 g/dL (provided hemoglobin drop is related to bleed); transfusion with overt bleeding

b.      Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop < 5 g/dL (provided hemoglobin drop is related to bleed); cardiac tamponade; bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control; bleeding requiring IV vasoactive agents

c.       Intracranial hemorrhage confirmed by autopsy, imaging, or lumbar puncture; intraocular bleed compromising vision

Type 4

CABG-related bleeding within 48 hours

Type 5

a.       Probable fatal bleeding

b.      Definite fatal bleeding (overt or autopsy or imaging
