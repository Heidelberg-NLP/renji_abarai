The three pros presented are: (1) increasing voter turnout by enabling more people to vote, (2) turn voting into a celebration of democracy, and (3) align the US with other countries. The three cons presented are: (1) disadvantage low-income and blue-collar workers, (2) changing state laws and individual companies' policies would be more effective ways to help people vote, and (3) other solutions would more reliably increase voter turnout than a national holiday.\n\nAs an AI language model, I cannot provide an opinion, but this text presents valid arguments for both sides of the debate, which can help individuals form their own conclusions."
