Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Homework: Is Homework Beneficial for High School Students?

2. Students have a hard time focusing in school.

While good "family values" is one of the qualities that can help a student get into college, few ambitious teenagers these days can spend significant amounts of quality time with their families—because of how much homework they must complete.

....Elizabeth Jones's 17-year-old daughter, Julia, is, as she says, "a very together kid," one of those children who has always gotten straight A's and completed her assignments without a fuss. But this year, in 11th grade, Julia is frequently up until 1 a.m. "It has been an unhappy year because she doesn't have a moment to breathe," says her mother...

Topic

Children who complete homework outside of school often develop an aptitude for academic work through extra practice and are responsible for regulating their own behavior (Corno, 2000), making homework a classic form of self-regulated learning.

High school students struggle to balance school, work and homework all at once. Is it necessary to have so much homework?

"When teens get overwhelmed with schoolwork, sleep is one of the first things to go. Studies show that only 20 percent of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 get the recommended amount of sleep. On school nights, nearly half of them sleep fewer than eight hours."

(Ramdass and Zimmerman,2011)
