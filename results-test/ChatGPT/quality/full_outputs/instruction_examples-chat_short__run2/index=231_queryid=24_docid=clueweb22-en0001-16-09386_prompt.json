You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

U.S. Top Combined Integrated Tax Rate on Corporate Income Would Become Highest in the OECD

May 3, 2021

Under President Biden’s tax plan, the United States would tax corporate income at the highest top rate in the industrialized world, averaging 65.1 percent.

First, the federal corporate tax rate would rise to 28 percent, which together with an average of state corporate tax rates would result in a 32.4 percent combined top corporate tax rate—highest in the industrialized world. As a second layer of tax on corporate income, the top federal marginal tax rate on capital gains and dividends would rise to 43.4 percent. Combined with average top state tax rates on capital gains and dividends and integrated with the combined top corporate tax rate, Biden’s proposals would produce a top combined integrated tax rate on corporate income of 65.1 percent—compared to 47.3 percent under current law.

In addition to federal level taxes, 44 states and D.C. have corporate income taxes and most states apply individual income tax rates to capital gains and dividends. The top combined integrated rate on corporate income reflects both the top entity level tax and the top shareholder level tax that apply at federal and state levels.

Top integrated rates would surpass 60 percent in 45 states and the District of Columbia. California and New Jersey would have top combined integrated rates of more than 70 percent. Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming would be tied for the lowest with rates of 59.2 percent—higher than the highest top rate in the OECD currently levied, by Ireland, at 57.1 percent.

On $100 of corporate profits, under Biden’s plan a firm would owe $32.35 in combined federal and state corporate income
