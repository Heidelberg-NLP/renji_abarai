Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

    There are over 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, which is why I think that the U.S. should allow the children of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but make the adult illegal immigrants get in line, behind all the other immigrants trying to become citizens. I think this because the children were brought here by their parents, who were probably fleeing the hardships of their home country. I also think the parents should be able to take responsibility for their actions

    Should Children of Illegal Immigrants be entitled to a Public Education? In this country, over 100,000 people immigrate to this country every year, and a vast majority of those immigrate here illegally. Of course, like most human beings, those people reproduce, and the children who are the offspring of said illegal immigrants are not allowed a public education in certain states of the US, but I say that leaving children to be uneducated is an atrocity and that it should be changed. Not only are
