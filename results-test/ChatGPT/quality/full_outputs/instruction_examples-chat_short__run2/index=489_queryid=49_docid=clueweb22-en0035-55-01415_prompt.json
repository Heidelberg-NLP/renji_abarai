Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

The Importance of Body Cameras for Police Officers | CDS Office Technologies
The Importance of Body Cameras for Police Officers

Whether or not the police should wear body cameras is a perennial topic that surfaces alongside almost every police-civilian encounter that makes it onto the news. The public is overwhelmingly in favor of their required use, believing them effective in curbing officer misbehavior. A study by the Cato Institute found that 89 percent of Americans strongly support officers wearing body cameras on duty. Support extends across political and demographic lines, indicating that this is neither a partisan, nor a generational issue.

Beyond public preference, though, there are still many salient benefits for police officers to wear body cameras while on duty.

5 Ways Body Cameras Benefit Police Officers

In an era of increasing distrust of authority figures in general, public opinion sees body cameras as a system of accountability. However, body cameras do have several significant advantages for police officers that often get overlooked. These advantages include:

1. Increased Officer Safety

Every day, police officers undertake an extremely dangerous job with many occupational hazards that are unique to their line of work. Often, officers are called to address situations with violent, often unpredictable individuals. Tragically, officers can and do get killed or injured in the line of duty.

Although body cameras don’t necessarily influence police behavior under duress, research does show that they improve officer safety. When individuals know or believe they’re being recorded, research supports the observation that people are more likely to behave less aggressively than if they aren’t being recorded or don’t know that they are.

2. Increased Public Confidence In Policing

Cato Institute indicates that the vast majority of Americans support mandatory use of body cameras by police officers, with some 53 percent “strongly” in favor of them. Body cameras are primarily seen as one way to inspire accountability in police forces around the country.

Such visible displays of transparency do affect the public perception and confidence of police officers. Although they don’t singlehandedly address the challenges of policing a population, the adoption of body cameras, more often than not, serves as a first step to developing better relations with a community.

3. Body Camera Footage Is Great for Training

Real-life examples are the most effective training material for anyone in a high-stress, high-stakes job with significant responsibility. Modern body cameras frequently include audio, making them valuable additions to training programs for police officers. By studying what experienced officers did right or wrong in a particular instance, new officers can accelerate their training with mental rehearsal to get off on the right foot.

Police video devices like the Panasonic Arbitrator offer unparalleled image quality, a 70-degree wide-angle view, and magnification up to 220x. That makes it easier than ever for police forces to collect video to improve the quality of the training they offer recruits.

4. Disprove Unwarranted Complaints

On average, about 8,500 police officers—less than 10 percent of most police forces—are investigated for misconduct every year. Over the past decade, some 30,000 officers have been decertified – many more have been cleared of wrongdoing with a significant number of those complaints deemed unwarranted. Accusations of police misconduct have continued to pose a serious problem, especially when they’re the result of misunderstandings or community members falsify them.

A study found by the UNLV Center for Crime and Justice Policy found that wearing body cameras can reduce misconduct complaints by up to 30 percent.

5. Reduced Paperwork Time for Officers

Beyond advantages in the field, body cameras are useful on a practical level. Devices like the Arbitrator integrate with other Panasonic officer tools, including Toughbooks. With these ultra-rugged devices designed for life in the field, officers are empowered to upload footage effortlessly to attach it to a case file. They’ll spend less time typing and fiddling with paperwork and more time serving their community.

CDS Empowers Police Officers With Next-Generation Technology

The pros and cons of police body cameras are heavily argued in public discourse, but many people overlook the practical advantages that this technology offers to the officers. From improving safety to decreasing paperwork time, body cameras do much more than train a watchful eye on police and civilians. CDS is proud to work with local police departments to develop the right set of tools to help them become productive, trusted community guardians.
