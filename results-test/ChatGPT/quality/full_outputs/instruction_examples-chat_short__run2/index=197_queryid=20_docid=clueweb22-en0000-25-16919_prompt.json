Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Drink Your Nutella: a Healthy Hazelnut Milk Tea Recipe

Drink Your Nutella: a Healthy Hazelnut Milk Tea Recipe

As someone who likes to be mindful of her health and wellness, I try not to make a habit of frequent desserts — everything in moderation, but of course, I’m human. But one foolproof way I’ve found to strike that ever-elusive health balance we all seek is by letting myself indulge freely in my most favorite treat: tea lattes!

Hazelnut Milk Tea Latte

If you’re new to the world of the tea latte, it’s an easy way to amp up your usual cuppa by brewing an extra-strong half cup of tea, and topping that off with an equal amount of steamed milk. Something about the combination of a favorite tea plus a hint of sweet and the satiating creaminess of frothed milk (coconut milk is especially delightful!) feels like such a treat without the sugar-coma implications. This twist on a traditional tea latte is a Nutella-inspired, healthy hazelnut milk tea recipe that will keep you sipping guiltlessly (and decadently) all day long!

The beauty of this particular brew comes from the tea leaf itself — rather than filling your cup with sugar and calories, that warm, uniquely hazelnut-and-chocolate-y goodness is coming from the aromatic honeybush blend and its accompanying cocoa nibs and hazelnut pieces. Paired with a light sweetener (I’m particularly fond of Plum Deluxe’s caramel agave stick in this recipe, taking those Nutella-inspired flavors to another level) and topped with creamy, frothed milk, you’ve got a healthy hazelnut milk tea recipe that’s as suitable for a rainy morning in your coziest reading nook as it is nightcap-style to compliment your favorite daily bedtime ritual. (Warm milk, anyone?)

Hazelnut Milk Tea Latte

Healthy Nutella Latte

Ingredients:

  • 1.5 teaspoon Plum Deluxe Chocolate Hazelnut Tea
  • 4 ounces of milk of choice
  • Optional: your favorite sweetener

Directions:
Steep your tea leaves in 4 ounces of hot water for around 3-5 minutes.

Meanwhile, warm 4 ounces of your favorite milk to be steamed atop your latte, either on a gentle simmer on the stove, or watching carefully in the microwave. Once your milk is warmed, you can use an appliance like a milk frother or steamer to steam, or just vigorously shake your warmed milk in a sealed mason jar for a minute or two until it’s frothed to your liking.

Once your tea has steeped, remove the leaves and pour into your favorite mug or teacup, add your optional choice of sweetener, and top with equal parts steamed milk. Mmm–a healthy hazelnut tea recipe that’s perfectly reminiscent of Nutella in a mug!
