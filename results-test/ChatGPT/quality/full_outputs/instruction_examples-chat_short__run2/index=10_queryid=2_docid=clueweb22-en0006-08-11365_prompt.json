Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

E-cigarettes and Vapes

E-cigarettes, vapes, vape or hookah pens, e-pipes, and other vaping products are battery-powered devices that allow users to inhale, or vape, aerosolized liquid (e-juice). Beginning July 1, 2019, Illinois law prohibits the sale of tobacco products, including these products, to people younger than age 21.

E-cigarettes recently surpassed conventional cigarettes as the most commonly used tobacco product among youth.1 It is critical that public health officials and the general public understand the potential risks of using them.

What are E-cigarettes and Vapes?

E-cigarettes are devices which produce an aerosol by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine—the addictive drug in regular cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products—flavorings, and other chemicals that help to make the aerosol. Bystanders can also breathe in this aerosol when the user exhales into the air. The nicotine in e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes is highly addictive.

These devices come in a variety of shapes and sizes, as pictured below, with several different names. Some e-cigarettes look like regular cigarettes, but many resemble pens or USB flash drives, and are not recognized as tobacco products. Larger e-cigarettes such as tank systems, or “mods,” do not resemble other tobacco products. E-cigarettes are known by many different names. They are sometimes called e-cigs, e-hookahs, mods, vape pens, vapes, and tank systems. Using an e-cigarette is often called “vaping” or “JUULing.” 2Most e-cigarette users do not consider themselves to be smokers.

Some e-cigarettes, like JUUL, are shaped like a USB flash drive. Like other e-cigarettes, these are battery-powered device that heats a nicotine liquid to produce an aerosol that is inhaled. According to the manufacturer, a single JUUL pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes. Although JUUL is currently the top-selling e-cigarette in the U.S., other e-cigarettes are becoming available that look like USB flash drives. Because of their shape, school teachers, administrators, and parents may not notice students using these devices in school, including in classrooms and bathrooms.

Youth e-cigarette use is an emerging public health threat

Among U.S. and Illinois high school students in 2017, almost 28% reported having ever tried cigarette smoking; 8% reported currently smoking cigarettes (at least one time during the last 30 days); 42% reported having ever used an electronic vapor product (including e-cigarettes, e-cigars, e-pipes, vape pipes, vaping pens, e-hookahs, and hookah pens); and 13% reported currently using an electronic vapor product. 1 Despite current tobacco use, cigarette smoking has declined dramatically among Illinois high school students. Since 2008, cigarette smoking among Illinois high school seniors has decreased from 21% to 5% in 2018.2

Alarmingly, e-cigarette use by high school seniors is higher than cigarette use was 10 years ago. Between 2016 to 2018, e-cigarette use in Illinois increased from 18.4% to 26.7% among high school seniors, a 45% increase; a 15% increase was seen among 8th grade students; and a 65% increase among 10th grade students.2 E-cigarettes put youth at risk for addiction and possibly worse asthma outcomes3, yet almost 40% of 10th and 12th grade youth believe there is low or no risk of negative health effects.2

E-cigarettes contain harmful chemicals

These products are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women, or adults who do not currently use tobacco products. The aerosol created by e-cigarettes can contain ingredients that are harmful and potentially harmful to the public’s health.4 The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reported that some people who use e-cigarettes have experienced seizures, with most reports involving youth or young adult users. Seizures or convulsions are known potential side effects of nicotine toxicity.5

E-cigarettes are considered tobacco products because most of them contain nicotine, which comes from tobacco. Besides nicotine, e-cigarettes can contain harmful and potentially harmful ingredients, including:

  • Ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs
  • Additives such as diacetyl, a chemical linked to serious lung disease (such as popcorn lung)
  • Volatile organic compounds
  • Heavy metals, such as nickel, tin, and lead.4

E-cigarettes are not safe for youth

Flavored e-cigarettes are very popular, especially among young people. Nationally, more than 8 of every 10 youth, aged 12-17 years who use e-cigarettes said they use flavored e-cigarettes. More than 9 of every 10 young adult e-cigarette users said they use e-cigarettes flavored to taste like menthol, alcohol, candy, fruit, chocolate, or other sweets. 2 E-cigarettes are advertised on television, radio, and other media. E-cigarettes and vaping devices are not covered by federal law restricting cigarette advertising.
