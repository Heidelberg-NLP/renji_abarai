Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Can Felons Vote in Georgia Now? [2020 UPDATED]

Can a Felon Vote in Georgia?

Georgia disenfranchises felons in jail, serving probation, or on parole. However, voting rights are released upon completion of sentence, supervised release, as well as complete payment of court fees and fines. See a more detailed criminal disenfranchisement laws across the U.S.

Restoring Felons Voting Right In Georgia

In Georgia, felons can register or re-register to vote following their voting right restoration.

Unfortunately, it is noticed, over time, that some personnel at local voter registration centers have little or no knowledge about Georgia laws concerning felons’ voting rights. They do not know what and what qualifies or disqualifies a prospect voter. This leads to unfair disenfranchisement of loads of felons in Georgia.

In the event of any complications, discuss with your lawyer or contact Georgia Justice Project (GJP) to reassert your rights. For easier registration, opt for online registration at the office of Georgia’s Secretary of State.

Voter Registration

Georgia’s constitution requires that prospective voters are U.S citizens and Georgia residents. Besides, voters must have attained, at least, 17.5 years at registration time and 18 on or before scheduled election date.

In Georgia, eligible voters must complete registration, not later than 28 days before a scheduled election. You may complete the registration online or at your local election office.

Online Registration

Voters can now register to vote online. Eligible residents can register via Georgia’s online voter registration system.

Voting

Voter Identification

Georgia requires voters to present photo identification before voting at the polling places. Driver’s license, tribal identity cards, military ID, State ID, U.S passports, employee ID cards, and county-issued voter ID cards are all acceptable means of identification in Georgia.

Poll Hours

Typically, polls in Georgia runs from 7 am to 7 pm. However, all voters on queue before 7 pm must be allowed to vote.

Type of Primary Election

Primary elections are conducted to enable eligible voters choose a  candidate to represent a political party for an elected office in the general election. Political parties also use their primary elections to elect party leaders as well as delegates for their conventions.

Georgia adopts an open primary election system, where eligible voters may not necessarily be affiliated to any particular political party.

Absentee Voting

In Georgia, all voters are allowed to opt for absentee voting – without any special eligibility demands. To use the absentee ballot, you must send your application on or before the Election Day.

Early Voting

No-excuse early voting is allowed in Georgia. This voting method allows eligible voters to vote in person at the polls before date of scheduled election. Where no-excuse early voting is allowed, voters are not required to present any excuse for voting earlier than the election day.

However, in states that do no support no-excuse early voting, although eligible voters may be allowed to vote before the scheduled election date, they must present a convincing-enough reason why they would not be present on the Election Day.

The District of Columbia and 34 other states, as of January 2018 had adopted the no-excuse pre-election-day voting.

Convicted Felons’ Right to Vote

Felons voting rights vary across states. In most state, felony convicts are barred from voting while in prison but may have their voting right back some period after sentence completion and payment of other cost fines and fees.
