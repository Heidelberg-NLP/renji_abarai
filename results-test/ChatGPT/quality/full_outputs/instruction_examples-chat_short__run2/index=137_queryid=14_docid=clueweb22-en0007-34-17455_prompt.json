Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Talking Sexual Orientation with Jane

This video defines sexual orientation as who you are attracted to physically and romantically. It also defines lesbian, homosexual, heterosexual, and bisexual. It normalizes being unsure of who you are attracted to during adolescence. 

Youth

Sexual orientation is all about who you’re romantically and sexually attracted to. Some people are attracted to those of a different gender (heterosexual), and some are attracted to those of the same gender (gay or lesbian). Some are attracted people of either the same or a different gender (bisexual), and some people do not experience sexual attraction (asexual), though they may be interested in a romantic relationship. It’s totally normal to have questions about sexual orientation, so it’s okay if you’re wondering about who you are and feel attracted to! Some people know their sexual orientation at a very young age and others don’t know until they are much older.

FAQs

How will I know if I’m gay or lesbian?

Sexual orientation refers to who you feel attracted to romantically or sexually. It’s totally normal to have intense attractions during puberty. Your feelings may be so strong that they aren’t necessarily directed toward a particular type of person, but instead seem to come out of nowhere. People who identify as gay or lesbian find that over time their attraction to people of the same gender gets more clearly focused. Right now, you may find yourself falling for a classmate or developing a crush on a particular person. You may even find these experiences pleasurable, troubling, or a mix of the two. Don’t worry, as you get older it may become clearer. For many it’s a journey, and your attractions may even change over the years.

 

For now, you may not know how to label your romantic and sexual feelings, and you should know there’s no rush to label your feelings or yourself. Just know that this is all perfectly normal, you are not alone in asking this question and there are no “right” or “wrong” answers.

What is bisexual, and how will I know if I am?

Understanding your sexual orientation can be confusing. You might feel that you don’t fit into a specific category, and you may notice that you have sexual and romantic feelings for people of your own gender and a different gender. These feelings may indicate you will identify as bisexual, but don’t worry about being unsure. Understanding your sexual orientation develops over time, and you should feel no pressure to identify in any particular way.

I’m not really sure who I’m attracted to. Am I normal?

Yes, of course! You and your feelings are absolutely normal and you have no control over who you find attractive. Many people are gay, lesbian or bisexual. Find out if your school has a gay-straight alliance (GSA). GSAs can help you find other people who are feeling and experiencing the same things you are.

Parents

A person’s sexual orientation is determined by the gender(s) of the people that person is romantically and sexually attracted to. Many people may first become aware of their sexual orientation during puberty. Hormonal changes associated with puberty can trigger new feelings of romantic or sexual attraction. This can be confusing and even a bit scary for many tweens and teens. These romantic and sexual feelings are often intense and not necessarily directed toward particular types of people. Sexual feelings for some may be provoked without cause during puberty. This can confuse tweens and teens as they begin to question their own and others’ sexual orientation. It is essential to help young people understand that it may take time to understand what gender(s) they find romantically or sexually attractive. It is also important to reiterate that there are no right or wrong answers and only they can determine their sexual orientation. As they get older, they will be better able to figure out who they find attractive.

People who identify as lesbian or gay find that over time their attraction to people of the same gender gets more clearly focused. Those who are bisexual find they are attracted to people of the same and a different gender. People who are asexual do not experience sexual attraction, though they may be interested in a non-sexual romantic relationship. Further, some people’s understanding of their sexual orientation changes over time, and some young people may resist labeling themselves in any way.

It is important that you show your children that you will love and support them always, regardless of whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual or heterosexual. If your child has trusted you with information about his or her sexual orientation, do not share that information with others without permission. Respect them and their decision to come out when and if they feel comfortable and safe.

We have made great advances in rights for gay, lesbian and bisexual people in the United States, but homophobia continues to exist in some communities, homes and schools. Lesbian, gay and bisexual young people have the right to safe and accepting environments. They have the right to live with dignity and without fear from stigma, discrimination and violence. Gay, lesbian and bisexual youth need inclusive and culturally appropriate health care and education. And, most importantly they need to be accepted and loved for who they are.

 

Conversation Starters

It is important that your children know that you are open to talking about sexuality and sexual orientation with them. You could start these important conversations with your children using some of the following:

Speak with your child when you’re both relaxed, like over dinner or in the car

“Is there anyone at school you like or are attracted to?”

Bring these issues up when you hear someone is getting married

If your child says her friend’s sister or a teacher is getting married, you can say, “That is fantastic! Is she marrying a man or a woman?”

If you hear your child or one of their friends say, “That’s so gay,” address it

Gently correct your child. Let them know it’s not okay to use “gay” as a way to put down or demean someone or something. Tell them that if they mean “that’s so stupid,” then they should say that.

Respect them and their decision to come out when and if they feel comfortable and safe.
