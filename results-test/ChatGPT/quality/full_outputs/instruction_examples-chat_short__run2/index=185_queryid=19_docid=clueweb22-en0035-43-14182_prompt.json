Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

How it works

Gay marriage is a conversational topic that have been talked about throughout the media. People across the nation disagree that whether homosexuality should be legalized. Martin Luther King said “ Marriage is a basic human right. You cannot tell people they cannot fall in love (I Have a Dream, MLK).” Even though it was meant in a different context, it still applies to homosexuals. Homosexual should be able to decide who they want to be with and marry.

On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court ruled the constitution guarantees a right for same- sex marriage (Supreme Co, Adam Liptak). Until this day same sex marriage is still being debated if it should be legal or not. The proposed Federal Amendment banning same-sex does not protect heterosexual marriages. It is a waste of time because it have no chance of becoming a law (Four Reasons to).
