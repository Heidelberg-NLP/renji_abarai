Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

5 Reasons Why Education Should Be Free

Have you ever looked at the rapidly skyrocketing figure indicating your student debt and wondered why you should be forced to pay for an education? I know I have and with the increasing popularity of socialism amongst millennials I’m not alone.

Today, Australian University students are often pushed into a lifetime of debt in order to access tertiary education. You’d think we’d get a high-quality product with that price tag but no dice. The successive cuts to the sector and explosion of enrolments since the introduction of the demand driven system have resulted in a noticeable decline in teaching and learning quality. University management has responded to this context with vicious restructures, empty advertising campaigns and a reliance on international student fees to prop up the sector.

In a world of rapidly changing technology and jobs, access to education is vital – whether you are leaving school, changing careers or looking to gain new skills and knowledge.

There is an alternative. Free education is not a pipe dream in Australia, with all fees abolished in 1974 by the Whitlam government until the eventual introduction of HECS in 1989. Germany has done it, joining many other countries in Europe. Such socialist policies have gained momentum amongst millennials with the rise of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn – unsurprising considering they are figures in countries where you also get crippled by student debt.

Here are some reasons why we should seriously consider scrapping the price tag attached to studying once again.

1.) It Would Combat Class Inequality

Australia likes to pretend it’s the country of the fair go when in reality class disadvantage is deeply rooted in every aspect of our society. Just look at our hideous treatment of welfare recipients, the overfunding of private secondary schools and demonisation
