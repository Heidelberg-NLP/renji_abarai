Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Michigan Minimum Wage to Increase in 2022

On January 1, 2022, the minimum wage in Michigan will increase to $9.87 per hour. This is a 22-cent increase from the current rate of $9.65 per hour, and the first increase in Michigan since 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

Michigan law requires automatic annual increases in the minimum hourly wage on January 1 of each year, up to $12.05 through 2030. However, the law also states that when the unemployment rate in Michigan exceeds 8.5 percent for the calendar year before the planned increase, the annual increase will automatically be delayed and there will be no increase in the minimum wage. In 2020, the unemployment rate in Michigan reached 9.9 percent, and as a result the minimum wage did not increase in January 2021.

The state also announced that in 2022 the minimum hourly wage rate for tipped employees will increase 8 cents from $3.67 per hour to $3.75 per hour. Likewise, the minimum hourly wage for employees 16-17 years of age will increase by 19 cents to $8.39 per hour.

Michigan employers will be responsible for paying any shortfalls to an employee if the employee’s hourly rate, including gratuities, does not equal or exceed the new minimum wage requirements.
