You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should humans drink milk? | Debate.org
  • Essential for Health

    Of course we should drink milk! It provides our body with necessary vitamins and minerals such as calcium and Vitamin D. We need these to help promote a healthy body and keep us at a healthy weight. Milk also helps preventing osteoporosis, which is brittle bones within the body. Milk is the food first provided to us at birth, so it must be essential to us.

  • My God you people are stupid

    None of these people have taken biochemistry, physiology, MNT, or likely any advanced nutrition classes ever. And it is blatantly obvious. You all sound stupid, and it saddens me that you're so stupid that you don't know you're stupid.

    Other animals will gladly drink another species' milk. Ask a cat or a bunny or any other baby animal that gets nursed off of another species.

    Milk absolutely does not deplete calcium from our bones. Are you serious? Idiot. Idiot, idiot, idiot. Take a chemistry class.

    Humans absolutely can digest milk. It's called "lactase", an enzyme that breaks down lactose. Some people are born without the ability to synthesis lactase, some people lose the ability with age. People lose flexibility with age- I'd like to encourage them to continue bending. If something you ingest becomes an irritant, eat less of it.

    Estrogen is found in flax, walnuts, soy- plenty of food sources.

    Saying human's bodies "evolved" for certain things is again: stupid. Talk to a biologist. Ask them if we evolved to eat certain things. It's natural selection, idiot.

    Bio-availability: rhubarb is one of the best plant sources of calcium: 348 mg per cup, while milk contains 300 mg per cup. However, even though cup per cup this vegetable contains more calcium than milk, you would have to eat more than 4 cups of rhubarb for your body to absorb as much calcium as it would get from a single cup of milk. This is because your body can absorb 32.1% of the calcium in milk but only 8.5% of the calcium in rhubarb.

    NONE OF YOU HAVE THE *SLIGHTEST FUCKING CLUE* WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

  • Yes, humans should drink milk.

    Yes, I believe that humans should drink milk. Milk is one of the only food products that we get in this world from animals that does not hurt them or in any way harm their way of life. Milk is one of the healthiest substances known to mankind, as long as it is not consumed in excess. There are no consequences to drinking milk, and it is very affordable, even to families that barely get by on a week by week basis.

  • It makes you taller

    Milk taste good and it helps with bone growth and size water does not do that it only hydrates the body plus milk hydrates your body more that water does so in conclusion milk should be essential unlike soda so we should all be drinking milk it's good for you

  • To grow taller

    It helps you grow and to be taller and help you build bigger stronger and better bones so drinking milk is what we should be drinking not water so it can help with bone problem and plus it tastes really really good and just because it's creamy taste Wich I love

  • Yes, we should drink milk......

    There's nothing wrong with it. From breastfeeding as infants to cow's milk as adults, milk is loaded with nutrients that are essential for developing and maintaining a healthy, strong body. Besides, if we didn't consume milk, then all kinds of cheeses would be unavailable, and who wants to live in a world where one can't have cheese with their whine, um, wine?

  • Can't speak for everyone

    But I digest milk fine. Yogurt, milk, cream, half and half, clotted cream, butter, yogurt, ice cream, cheeses -all dairy. I love it and eat it daily and have no undesirable side effects, but I know a lot of people who don't handle it very well. Am I weird or something, or is milk just good for some people and bad for others.

  • Diverging from something natural, to something rational.

    We have a tendency to pin this argument to a stake when saying that it is not natural. Well this is invalid in the form of what is truly natural, what is natural for humans? Humans diverge from the animal kingdom in the fact that we have the tendency to create opinions with rational thought and put these into effect. We create elaborate structures and mighty transports... Is it not natural that we would find all the benefits, the vitamins, the essential nutrients and better ourselves as rational human beings and invigorate our bodies? It is affordable, any cons are outweighed by the pros, if any of the cons are actually plausible that is. We are actual rational, constantly thinking and advancing individuals, we have done things far more "unnatural" than drinking milk, like say equality in process amongst our species? Still prefer the natural mindlessness?

  • The gene mutation survived and became predominant for a reason.

    In parts of Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa, lactose tolerance developed and was perpetuated because it provided a health and development advantage. I am descended from those people. I thrive on milk and dairy products. Telling me not to drink milk would be like telling my sisters with fragile, kinky hair not to use heavy conditioners.

  • It's healthy and delicious.

    Yes, humans should drink milk. There's nothing wrong with it. From breastfeeding as infants to cow's milk as adults, milk is loaded with nutrients that are essential for developing and maintaining a healthy, strong body. Besides, if we didn't consume milk, then all kinds of cheeses would be unavailable, and who wants to live in a world where one can't have cheese with their whine, um, wine?

  • Milk Makes You Feel Bad

    Try running 90 to 120 minutes after drinking milk and you will see what I mean. The body does not digest lactose after age 2. It will cause you cramps bloating and side stiches. Although It can be used as an effective recovery drink due to is casein and whey, meat is much better. Most of the earths population cant digest milk so I think that says something strong. Get calcium from other sources like spinach and fish, the vitamin d is added anyways. In nature no other creature akes the milk of another creature its just unnatural

  • Milk not from cows

    Goats take up less space, use less resources and require less medical treatment than cows. A cup of goat's milk also contains a higher amount of vitamin A, riboflavin and niacin than the same amount of cow's milk. Because goat's milk does not contain agglutinin, the fat globules don't cluster together like they do in cow's milk, making goat's milk easier for the body to digest. One cup of goat's milk contains 33 percent of the RDA of calcium and only 168 calories. And one cup of goat's milk provides 8.7 grams of protein, about 18 percent of the RDA for protein.

  • Milk is for specific time in life and species...

    I am oppossed to drinking Cow's Milk or any animal produced milk. Milk is touted as a great source for Calcium (and Vit D is added in). Milk is the middle man of minerals and nutrients. The best sources is Plant life and instead of pinning down a cow or goat just eat green vegatables and get not only calcium but a ton of other phytonutrients. Animal Milk is ok to consume in modertion if you enjoy it but it should not be staple at the dinner table. Humans (babies) should drink human milk b/c of a immature GI tract but after a child recieve all of its appropraite teeth then milk should be weened.

  • DsnowsIloveFrogs Argument

    DsnowsIloveFrogs brought up cows and corn which, in my opinion, is the most important issue when talking about the consumption of milk and beef. Cows don't eat corn (naturally) but our government has instituted policies which make it not just profitable, but lucrative, for farmers to overproduce this and other "commodity" crops. Farmers can plant, harvest, and sell their corn for less than it costs to produce it and still make a profit. With corn being overproduced, everybody has to think of something to do with it. They decided to feed it to the animals. Some salmon farms are even training the fish to eat corn! I am not going to pretend that I know what affect cow milk has on the human body. What I would assert, as a matter of common sense, is that humans consuming healthy, grass-fed cow milk would have less negative side-effects (if there are any) than milk consumed from cows who have been fed a corn diet who have to be treated with antibiotics to kill all the health problems associated with their corn diet. The underlying problem is government policies enacted by government officials who are influenced by and cater to big corporations.

  • Causes World Hunger

    Hi, milk may do the body a small good but it also does millions of people wrong. 95% of America's oats are eaten by livestock, 56% of American farmland is used for the production of cattle and 80% of America's corn is eaten by livestock (Cows can't even digest corn). Milk has also been shown to accelerate cancers, conditions for cattle are horrid and it's kind of gross.

  • No. It was not intended for us.

    No matter how someone tries to rationalize it, the reality is that milk from a cow has a single purpose: to feed the cow's calves. Although we may be familiar with milk and like the taste of it, many people are lactose intolerant because our bodies did not really evolve to consume another animal's milk. Yet even if you do not object on these grounds, the other anti-milk argument is that it is not sustainable. It takes more resources and contributes more to global warming to feed and maintain a cow just for its milk.

  • Do you know what cows milk does and how it is sourced?
