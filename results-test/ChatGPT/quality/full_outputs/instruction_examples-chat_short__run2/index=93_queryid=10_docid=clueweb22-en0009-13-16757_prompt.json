You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Two young brothers wearing masks All U.S. residents (ages 5 and older) are now eligible for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes  COVID-19. The Pfizer vaccine received full FDA approval for people ages 16 and older and continues to be available for ages 12-15 (and now ages 5-11) under the FDA’s emergency use authorization. Across the country, vaccine programs are available at schools, community clinics and pharmacies. Vaccination provides the best opportunity to further protect your child from COVID-19 and help get life back to normal.

Like many parents, you may have questions about vaccine safety and wonder if vaccination is the right choice for your child. While caution is understandable, it’s important that all eligible individuals be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Why vaccinate your child

In order for the United States to reach herd immunity and control the spread of COVID-19, almost all the population — including children — needs to be immunized against the virus. While most infected children usually experience minimal symptoms, some can develop severe illness. In fact, children now account for approximately 25% of all COVID-19 cases. Even asymptomatic infections can spread the virus through schools and sports teams, affecting not only other children, but also the more at-risk adults they interact with. 

Vaccination gets our kids back to the programs, activities and social interactions they desperately need for appropriate academic, social-emotional and physical development. The sooner all eligible Americans are vaccinated, the sooner we can get our country — and our kids’ lives — back to normal. 

Answering your frequently asked questions

Experts at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) address your common concerns to help you make the best decision for your family.

Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children and teenagers?

Teen boy receiving vaccine Yes. The currently approved COVID-19 vaccines have gone through clinical trials and scientific review just like any other vaccine — including those your child has likely already received — and no standards of quality or safety were sacrificed.  Learn more about mRNA vaccine technology and approval.

Does the COVID-19 vaccine have long-term side effects?

Short-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are usually mild and can include fatigue, headache and muscle ache. To date, after hundreds of millions of doses, the currently available mRNA vaccines have had no cases of long-term side effects. Hear more from Dr. Paul Offit, Director of the Vaccine Education Center at CHOP.

You may have heard about a condition called myocarditis, which has sparked media attention as a very rare side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, this means that misconceptions and myths about the condition abound. Here's what you should know about myocarditis and mRNA vaccines.

Can mRNA vaccines change an individual’s DNA?

No. mRNA is active in a cell’s cytoplasm and never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept.

Watch this video to learn more how mRNA vaccines work.

Can the COVID-19 vaccine cause infertility?

Infertility has not been found in women infected with COVID-19, so it would not be expected to be a concern for the vaccine. Learn more.

My child has a pre-existing condition/health problem. Should they get the COVID-19 vaccine?

In many cases, children and teens with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, IBD or other autoimmune diseases, or those who are taking medications that compromise their immune system, are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for use cannot cause COVID-19, even in those with weak immune systems. Therefore, individuals with immune-compromising conditions may get the COVID-19 vaccine, as long as they do not have a severe allergy to a vaccine component (i.e., one that causes anaphylaxis or requires medical intervention).

We encourage you to talk to your child’s medical specialist to discuss individual risks and benefits and determine whether your child should receive the vaccine.
