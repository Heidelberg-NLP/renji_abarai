Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

The minimum wage should not increase. It should be abolished. The purpose of the minimum wage is to stop disfavored workers from overcoming their disfavor by offering to accept a lower wage. As such, it is discriminatory and illegal.

Yes. So should the business owners return on their investment which will increase the price of goods and services.

That would be an automatic. If the person getting $12.00/hr now gets $15.00/hr than the person getting $15.00/hr now wants $18.00/ hr. It moves along sequentially. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

Also, don’t let anyone tell you that the employer will absorb it. They will pass it along to their customers as a part of their expenses.

I had plenty of friends that were surprised that I was not upset when Obama Care was passed. They assumed that as a business person that I would have to “eat” the cost because that is what they were told. I told them that it was a new part of doing business and t

They assumed that as a business person that I would have to “eat” the cost because that is what they were told. I told them that it was a new part of doing business and that that part would be added to my selling price. Many were confused. They did not understand that any Company’s expenses were passed along to the customer. This was especially true of employees of the government.

This might sound unconventional, but hands down I’d go with blue-chip art. A Basquait painting soared 2,209,900% when it was bought for $5,000 and sold for $110,500,000. And if you think that is crazy, a Leonardo Da Vinci painting skyrocketed 5,328,894%. Although not guaranteed, if you can f

In a perfect world, yes. However, we live in the real world and that’s a whole ‘nuther planet. If the minimum wage suddenly doubled from 7 something to 15 dollars/hour, that increase might consume any ability to raise anyone else’s wage without raising the retail price of a company’s goods or services, and that increase might cost them business which might reduce their ability to pay even more, which might force them to lay off workers.

Yes of course they should also increase, For why other wise work harder and secure a better education if the lowest paid workers receive the same amount in wages as you do.

What do you mean by should they?????

Lets say the new guy makes $8/hour. I have some skills and experience so I make $14/hour.

BANG!!!! The new guys wage is now $15/hour, Mine goes up to $15/hour, am I going to be happy? Hell NO!

I have been working at “ACME CORP” for 7 years, lets say. People come to me and I solve problems, train the new guy, now making the same money as me, AND fix new guys screw ups.

Yep, I am gonna want more money. OR the skilled labor will look for new jobs….

Trust me, you lose your skilled labor, you lose your profit QUICK!

All wages are too low for the 95% of Americans who make up the ‘working class’ and they’re not going to ever go up to any kind of reasonable point. That’s why workers should get affordable health insurance as a benefit of citizenship. A very slight up tick in the taxes of the 5% that make up the ‘investing class’ would do the trick…. but of course that would be ‘socialism’ so ‘ya can fuggettaboutit!

That would defeat the point. That is called inflation and cost of living increase.

Minimum wage is set based on the hourly income an individual must earn over 60 hours per weak to afford, food and shelter.

In some parts of the country it does, in others it won’t pay for a couple meals.

Of course! In fact, any time the minimum wage increased, I increased my hourly rate by twice the percentage. All’s well!

They would.

Because a lot of higher wage earners have things like CoLA clauses in their contracts. When minimum wage goes up, the cost of living increases. Some businesses that were barely breaking even before go out of business. Others lay off enough employees to keep their payroll expense from increasing. Others will attempt to raise prices and pass the added expense on to the consumer. The large increase in unemployment will result in higher taxes (which should be included in cost of living to get accurate comparisons of different regions) which will likewise hurt businesses. And of course w

Should? Yes. And prices and everything should get back in balance at a higher point and nothing would be accomplished because the higher wages would be offset by higher prices.

But it will take a lot of time and cause a lot of unfair problems on the way. At first it will limit the number of jobs. Some jobs will no longer be worth what they cost in labor.

Limiting jobs means workers compete for jobs instead of employers competing for workers. Companies don’t have to offer benefits and perks to compete for workers. They don’t have to give many raises because there are plenty of others who will tak

Limiting jobs means workers compete for jobs instead of employers competing for workers. Companies don’t have to offer benefits and perks to compete for workers. They don’t have to give many raises because there are plenty of others who will take the job. Workers compete by bringing higher educations and skills for lower paying jobs. Students, or others with questionable work value will find it very hard to get jobs. They will not provide enough value for their pay and others looking for work that are proven will get those jobs.

While it sounds strange no minimum wage or an extremely low one allows there to be an unlimited number of jobs. With unlimited jobs employers are competing for employees. They will risk trying an unproven worker. They will provide benefits to keep workers in their organization. They will give raises to their better employees so they won’t leave and go to a competitor.

The market will get a balance point where pay will essentially allow all workers to work and employers to find enough employees.

Throwing in an artificial limit on the number of jobs available by increasing the minimum wage puts a hand on the balance scale. That hand causes employees to compete for a limited number of jobs instead of employers competing for employees. It ultimately hurts all employees.

No, but you ask a complex question and seem to mix the two when they should not be mixed. As I understand it some people get paid only on the tips they make, others get paid on a small wage and tips, and imho the government wants everyone to earn a wage so they can support themselves and on neither of those can they support themselves so the government (federal and state) say an amount that people can’t get paid lower than. Now if you take a job that pays either of those ways then that’s your problem but the government doesn’t want that. so as time goes by the minimum wage a person can earn is

Other hourly wages can start with the minimum wage but as you’re on the job you should get an increase in 3 months and then yearly when your work is reviewed. So it doesn’t go up automatically, it’s determined on performance. So if you’re not working out the employer would let you go. The wage is an incentive so it’s up to you to learn and do the job.

When the minimum wage increases, should other higher wages increase as well?

No, but they would without interference in the market of a mandates minimum wage.

Wage rates are a result of the value brought by the labor those rates acquire. Having to pay an inflated rate above the value brought forces prices higher and encourages the employer to find ways of reducing labor.
