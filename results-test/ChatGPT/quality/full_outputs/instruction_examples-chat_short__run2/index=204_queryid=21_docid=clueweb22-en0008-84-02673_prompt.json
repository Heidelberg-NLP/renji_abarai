Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Private car use is relatively prevalent and is regarded as an extravagant way of life. A lot of us travel by airplanes. The amount of carbon dioxide created by an Airbus is about 9 kilograms per kilometers (Math! How much CO2 is released by Aeroplane?, 2007, Internet). That means if we take a 13000-kilometer flight from Taiwan to American, we are actually creating approximately 120 tones of CO2. Obviously, we are leaving our carbon footprints across the globe. The burning of fusel fuel is responsible for seventy five percent of total amount of carbon dioxide since 1959 (Human Responsibility for Increase in CO2 and GHG Concentration, 2011, Internet). To think critically, it is unlikely that transportations, energy productions, and other chemical usages release such extend of carbon dioxide. What else can be the roots?
