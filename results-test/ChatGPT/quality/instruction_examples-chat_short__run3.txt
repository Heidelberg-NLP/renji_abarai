This is a policy on insider trading and contains guidelines and rules to prevent insider trading or allegations of insider trading among directors, officers, associates, and consultants of ADP. It explains the penalties that may occur in case of breach and defines the definition of material non-public information. It outlines the requirements applicable to everyone, such as the prohibition to trade ADP securities while aware of non-public material information, and specific rules applicable to restricted persons, such as brokerage accounts and blackout periods. Therefore, it contains no rhetorical argument.

The author provides reasoning from each party involved, including scholars like Milton Friedman and Henry Mann, to provide multiple perspectives. Overall, the essay appears to have a good structure and presents solid evidence to support its argument. Therefore, the rhetorical argument quality can be classified as high.

The text presents arguments against legalizing performance-enhancing drugs, including that they are often harmful, lead to health risks, and are not typically available for sports use. The author also argues against making doping legal by stating that many banned substances are banned for a reason and that a lack of regulation could result in performances that are inhumane for the athletes. The author also considers the impact of arousing public suspicions about the possibility of performers using performance-enhancing drugs, which could ultimately diminish public interest in sports. The author presents sound arguments that support the position presented and provides supporting evidence to back up each of the points made throughout the text.

It is unethical and unfair for athletes to use performance enhancing drugs as it is a form of cheating and goes against the fair spirit of competition in sports. The consequences of using PEDs can range from aching joints to long-term health issues, and athletes risk losing their eligibility to compete if caught using such drugs. The use of PEDs is also on the rise in high schools, where young athletes may not understand the long-term effects. Overall, the use of performance enhancing drugs undermines the integrity of sports and fair competition.

The opinion piece presents a clear argument that the lack of conflict resolution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict affects both sides, and that the current right-wing Israeli government is incapable of facing the reality of the existence of a Palestinian people. The piece also highlights the different perspectives within the right-wing, including denying the existence of a Palestinian people and those who talk about some form of autonomy for Palestinians without territorial control. The writer challenges the notion that the current government cannot negotiate with the Palestinians and argues that this is actually the best government to reopen negotiations because without the right wing engaged in actively framing the narrative, no solution is possible. Overall, the argument is well-structured and coherent. I would rate it as high quality.

For the motion:

Good evening everyone. Today, I stand before you to argue for the motion that "Everyone should become vegetarian." 

First and foremost, let's talk about the environmental benefits of adopting a vegetarian lifestyle. Animal agriculture has a significant impact on the environment, contributing to deforestation, habitat loss, air and water pollution, and climate change. By eliminating meat from our diets, we can reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future. 

Moving on to the economic benefits, a vegetarian diet can be more cost-effective than a meat-based diet. Meat is often more expensive than plant-based protein sources, and a vegetarian diet can also reduce healthcare costs by promoting better health outcomes. 

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there are ethical reasons to consider a vegetarian lifestyle. Many people choose to become vegetarian to avoid supporting the inhumane treatment of animals in factory farms and slaughterhouses. As we learn more about the intelligence and emotional capacity of animals, it becomes increasingly clear that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. 

In conclusion, a vegetarian lifestyle offers significant health, environmental, economic, and ethical benefits. I urge you to consider making the switch to a plant-based diet and joining the growing movement towards a more sustainable and compassionate future. Thank you.
