It is unethical for athletes to use performance enhancing drugs as it provides an unfair advantage and goes against the spirit of sports. The history of doping in sports dates back centuries and has become a major issue in recent years, with more refined methods and technologies being used. Athletes who test positive for PED use face consequences such as losing their eligibility to compete and being banned from competition for a period of time. PEDs can also have negative physical effects on the user, including aching joints, tendon injuries, high blood pressure, and liver problems. Therefore, the use of PEDs in sports should be banned.

The article presents the opinion that the right-wing Israeli government is not capable of facing the reality of the existence of a Palestinian people and refuses to negotiate with them. The lack of resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not only hurts the Palestinians but also directly affects Israel. The economic measures may delay an explosion, but they cannot prevent it. The writer believes that the lack of willingness of the current Israeli government to negotiate must be challenged and that the government should reopen negotiations with the Palestinians. Overall, the style is clear, and the argument is well-structured and easy to follow, so I would rate it as "high."

As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs, but I can provide an analysis of the arguments presented in these articles:

Both articles present valid arguments, but they have different conceptions of the issue. On one hand, Rachel Moran talks about the sex trade as sexually coercive and dehumanizing for women and condemns its legalization. On the other hand, Gillian Abel argues that sex work should be considered as any other occupation and legalized to guarantee labor rights and prevent exploitation.

Regarding the questions asked:

- Whether prostitution should be legal or not is a matter of debate with no clear answer. The issue poses challenges around liberation vs. exploitation, individual choice vs. social responsibility, among others. 
- Denying sex workers their right to work legally can infringe upon other individual rights, such as access to legal aid, representation, or protection.
- Legalizing sex work may reduce the criminalization of people involved in the sex trade, and allow them to claim labor rights, protection, and justice. Concerns of possible side effects should be addressed and may require complementary policies, such as those related to trafficking, healthcare, taxation or education.
- The implementation of the "Nordic Model" or total criminalization only to clients is another alternative to the legalization of prostitution. It is based on the principle of equating prostitutes with victims and the clients with abusers, aiming to reduce demand by reducing the acceptability of prostitution.  However, this approach has also been criticized for not addressing the structural causes of prostitution, putting women in greater danger by driving sex work underground, and facilitating police harassment and abuse.

This text argues that, although obesity is clearly a health threat, it does not fit the traditional definitions of a disease because it lacks a universal concomitant group of symptoms or signs and the impairment of function which characterize disease. Therefore, labeling obesity a disease is not a necessary step in a campaign to combat obesity, and may be interpreted as self-serving advocacy without a sound scientific basis.

For the motion:

Ladies and gentlemen, it is my firm belief that everyone should become a vegetarian. The reasons for this are manifold, and have been much documented in recent times.

Firstly, let’s talk about the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. As my colleague has already pointed out, vegetarian diets are known to be lower in saturated fats, which can be a major cause of heart disease. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to consume more vitamins and nutrients, such as Vitamin C, fiber and antioxidants, which keeps them healthy and reduces the risk of certain types of cancer. It’s also worth noting that studies have shown that meat production can be a major contributor to air and water pollution, so by reducing meat consumption, we can make a real difference to the environment.

Secondly, from an ethical standpoint, vegetarianism undoubtedly has its benefits. Studies have shown that many animals suffer from poor living conditions and inhumane treatment before being slaughtered for our consumption. By becoming vegetarians, we can help to alleviate this suffering, and ensure that animals are treated with respect and dignity.

Lastly, I’d like to talk about economics. We all know that meat can be expensive to produce, and oftentimes it is the small farmers who bear the brunt of these costs. By reducing our meat consumption, we can ensure that these farmers receive a fair return on their investment, and that they can continue to work the land and provide for their families.

In conclusion, I think it’s clear that there are many compelling reasons for everyone to become a vegetarian. Whether it’s for health, ethical, or economic reasons, the switch is not only necessary, but will lead to positive results for all.
