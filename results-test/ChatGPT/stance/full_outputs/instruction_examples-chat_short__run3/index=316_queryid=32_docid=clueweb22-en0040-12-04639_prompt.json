You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

What Are the Companies That Manufacture Electronic Voting Machines?

General Reference (not clearly pro or con)

John R. Patrick, Doctor of Health Administration (DHA), President of Attitude LLC and former Vice President of Internet Technology at IBM, in his 2016 book titled Election Attitude: How Internet Voting Leads to a Stronger Democracy, wrote:

“At one point, there were 19 voting machine companies listed in the Federal Election Commission Buyers Guide, but the guide is no longer available. Through a series of mergers, acquisitions, and business failures, the voting machine industry currently is dominated by the three companies. All three companies are privately held and do not disclose their revenue or profits.

Dominion Voting Systems Corporation is based in Toronto, Canada. It sells electronic voting and tabulating hardware around the world. In May 2010, Dominion acquired Premier Election Solutions, formerly Diebold Election Systems, from Election Systems & Software. They just had acquired Premier Election from Diebold, but were required by the United States Department of Justice to sell Premier Election Solutions for anti-trust concerns.

Election Systems & Software, based in Omaha, Nebraska, is the giant of the voting machine industry. In addition to a line of hardware products, the company provides equipment rental, print services, maintenance services, ballot management services, election support, professional services, and voter registration mailing services. The company’s equipment, software, and services are used by municipalities and counties throughout the U.S.

HartInterCivic based in Austin, Texas, has been working with election professionals for more than 100 years. The company makes a wide range of voting machines hardware and services. Its election services include consultation, training, professional services, preventative maintenance, and ballot production services. The company claims its mission is to help advance democracy one election at a time.”

The Voting Industry website included a list of electronic voting machine vendors, categorized into tiers based on their market prominence (accessed Aug. 17, 2006):

“First Tier voting systems vendors – We again consider First Tier vendors to be firms you simply can’t ignore. The grouping here is somewhat artificial. However, these are the big 4 vendors that control the lion’s share of the industry: Election Systems and Software [ES&S], Diebold Election Systems, Sequoia, and Hart Intercivic.

Second Tier voting systems vendors include: AccuPoll (has filed for bankruptcy), Advanced Voting Solutions, Avante, Unilect, and Voting Technologies International.

Internet and other voting system vendors – Here is a list of of Internet Voting Companies, Regional Voting Firms and Other elections firms that may have older or very new products: AutoMARK Corporation, Comfidex Corporation, Danaher Corporation, Democracy Systems, MicroVote, Populex, SafeVote [Internet voting systems only], Dategrity (formerly VoteHere), and TruVote.”

CorpWatch, a corporate watchdog website, published a Sep. 8, 2004 article titled “November Surprise: Electronic Voting Machines Add Uncertainty to Close Election Races,” which stated:

“The Federal Election Commission states that 19 companies produce DREs [as of Feb 20, 2003; list has since been removed from the FEC website; last attempt to access on Aug. 17, 2006], but the market is dominated by just four: Election Systems and Software (ES&S), Diebold Election Systems, Sequoia Voting Systems, and Hart Intercivic.

Between DREs and other voting technologies, machines of these four companies will tally nearly 100 million votes this Election Day, the vast majority of those cast. Furthermore, nearly 50 percent of precincts will use machines created by ES&S.”
