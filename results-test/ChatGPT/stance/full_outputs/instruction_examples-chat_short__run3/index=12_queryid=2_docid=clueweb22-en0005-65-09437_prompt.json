Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

    Define safe.;)

    It's unlikely that anything will blow up. On the other hand, it really isn't good for the battery, which is why most manufacturers say something like "Our product is capable of pass-through charging, but you shouldn't use this feature."

    Vaping tends to take more current than the charger supplies so the current for your vape comes from the battery, not the charger. That means the battery is charging for a few minutes, discharging for 3 seconds, charging for 90 s, discharging for 4 s, charging for whatever... It's not a safe or healthy process for the battery. If there's anything wrong with the battery, this stressful process could trigger a serious problem. Of course, it's not likely that anything is wrong with the battery.

    Short version: It will usually shorten the battery's life, but not in an exciting way.

    I tend to agree with @Hawise It's probably not good, but it also probably isn't going to blow up. I will add questions like this are part of the reason I don't use fixed battery mods.

    Read a post a long time ago that pass-through use is not a good idea. Something about it causes the plus and negative ends of the battery to heat up out of proportion with the middle of the battery causing a unstable state. Same was said about grabbing freshly charged batteries out of the charger and using them. You need the give the battery time to reach oneness with the chemical/temperature Zen after recharging. Perhaps Mooch or someone with more battery knowledge than me can shed some more light on the subject.

    If you have more than one device there really isn't a good reason to use pass through charging. Maybe if you are out and about longer than expected would be the only reason I could think of.

    Batteries get warmer when they are charging and when they are discharging. Slower charging and discharging mean less heat. I vape at higher resistance and lower power compared too what's fashionable which helps minimize battery temperatures (1.3 ohm, 380F max temp, and 16-20 max watts). If the fire button is pressed while my devices are charging my understanding is the recharging process is stopped until the fire button is released but the battery will get warmer than if you do only one or the other. Never the less I almost always charge on-board, don't hesitate to use a mod that's cconnected to a charging cable and never see the battery go past slightly warm.

    If I was vaping at very high watts, near or past the rated amp limit of the battery, may be I'd only reccharge in an exterenal charger inside of a 55 gallon drum in the backyard. Pushing the limits complicates things.

    Welcome @anthra_X !

    Since a Stick V8 kit can be had for $30-$35, a simple solution would be to pick up a second one. Backups are always a good idea and a second tank is great for changing flavors on the fly!

    Better yet, if you are like me (I can suck down the charge on the stick faster then the other can charge :w00t:), look into a mod with external batteries you can just swap out when needed. More up front cost now, but benefits quickly "pay you back!"

    I have heard "yes" and "no" but I don't like to vape personally via passthrough, even if a manufacturer states that you can. Like others, I agree it will likely put stress on the battery over time, if done consistently. I'd say you could probably do it in a pinch without any kind of explosion, but it's a habit I don't need, since I have some mod backups. I have a few "USB" charge batteries, a couple I really like, and I do find them useful on occasion. I also will only use a wall wart for charging as if something goes wrong, I don't want it affecting my computer. I also ordered a magnetic charger to cut down on wear and tear on my USB mods (and my phone, which is elderly, and starting to show wear and tear on the USB port.

    So, it's not exactly "unsafe" it's just best practice. If you really like your smok stick there is little reason not to get a backup and swap them out, and it is probably good for your battery to "rest" some between charges.

    If you want to go external battery especially if you like a higher wattage vape, looking at external battery mods is certainly not a bad idea either. :)

    Vaping while charging also puts a lot of stress on the charging port from the cable moving around. Those aren't very sturdy and, if they break, you won't be able to charge it at all.

    Welcome and glad you joined.
    Good question, Smok has not defined the pass through parameters.
    Would contact Smok and ask:
