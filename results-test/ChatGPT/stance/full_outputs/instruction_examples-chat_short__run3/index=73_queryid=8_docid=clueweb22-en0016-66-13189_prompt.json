Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

I have heard all the arguments, including the absurd “ well if you allow abortion, people should be allowed to kill their toddlers.”

Huge difference between fetus and actual human separate of “host”. Once a woman is no longer having her life at risk, my opinion changes.

BUT…until a fetus is fully viable (and please don't talk to me about miracle children who are now hale and healthy who were 20 week fetuses. The fact is they are RARE. Until technology can give a better than chance in a million odds, 20 or even 24 weeks is still a fetus), the woman should be the only one making the choice.

Yes, I

Yes, I know. Not fair to the fetal father. But his life and mental well being is not directly affected by pregnancy. He will not die as a result of preclampsia, toxemia, or a host of other maternal killers. He will not suffer the torment of hormones as the pregnancy progresses. His testicles will not drop years after a pregnancy.

I am unmoving on this.

I am appalled that there are states that give rapists parental rights if their victims become pregnant.

Abortion needs to be legal because women are not serfs. We don't become non citizens when we are pregnant. Our rights are not suspended. If you argue that every life is precious, but ignore the woman in the equation, you are a hypocrite.

Summer of 2015

My mother woke me up at 4 am. Her voice was whispery and shaky, as if she could hardly speak. My 17 year old self rushed to her aid, my younger siblings still asleep. She told me she needed an ambulance. My father was on a business trip and after she called him, he advised her to go to the hospital. Her left arm was numb, her chest was aching and she could hardly breathe. With shaky hands, I called an ambulance for her. She was 47 years old, and a few weeks into her pregnancy.

Summer of 2015

My mother woke me up at 4 am. Her voice was whispery and shaky, as if she could hardly speak. My 17 year old self rushed to her aid, my younger siblings still asleep. She told me she needed an ambulance. My father was on a business trip and after she called him, he advised her to go to the hospital. Her left arm was numb, her chest was aching and she could hardly breathe. With shaky hands, I called an ambulance for her. She was 47 years old, and a few weeks into her pregnancy. I waited by her side as the paramedics came.

I waited and waited. I had to care for my siblings. I was worried sick. What if she never returned from the hospital? Dark, negative thoughts filled my teenage mind in such ways I wish no child should ever have to think about their parents.

When I woke up the next morning, she had returned. She was still exhausted, but okay. She told me that due to her age, her pregnancy was developing badly, and dangerously. She had a heart attack because of that problematic pregnancy in the ambulance. My mother thought she was going to die in that ambulance.

Her pregnancy was terminated immediately. That possible pregnancy put her life in serious danger. I am glad I live in a country where abortions are legal, and can be performed by a professional, authorized doctor. That was my mother, but there are many women in similar positions, who would possibly be rejected from undergoing an abortion, even if that endangers her own life.

I wholeheartedly believe that every woman should have the ability to choose to have a child, or terminate her pregnancy legally and safely. Because if we don’t provide her a safe termination, she may be putting hers or the fetus’s life in danger. Because she might try to terminate it in various ways, which are illegal, unsafe and unauthorized.

For the mother and the child, abortions should be every woman’s choice. I honestly have no intention of sounding like a radical feminist, but I refuse to be told by a couple of conservative old men that it’s better to endanger my health and life if I happen to get pregnant, have problems during my pregnancy, or for many other reasons I want to terminate a pregnancy.

Q: Should abortion be illegal?

A: Do you want more abortions, and more dead women? Then yes.

All statistics show that countries and states which allow abortions have fewer abortions than those who bans abortions. Counter-intuitive, I know, but bear with me.

The reason is that you will basically always have abortions. There will always be women who are so desperate that they will stop at nothing to terminate their pregnancy, for honour reasons, cultural reasons, career reasons, or economic reasons. Because let’s face it: women are killed for having premarital sex, called sluts if they are single m

There will always be women who are so desperate that they will stop at nothing to terminate their pregnancy, for honour reasons, cultural reasons, career reasons, or economic reasons. Because let’s face it: women are killed for having premarital sex, called sluts if they are single mothers, their career dies, or they are forced into debt and economic ruin.

If you ban abortions, you only drive abortions underground and make them unsafe. So the result is more dead women (except pregnant rich women, who can always take a vacation somewhere abroad or out of state and come home un-pregnant).

Abortion bans are also often accompanied by a general anti-women attitude, which means no paid parental leave, no subsidised or free maternal health care, no pre-natal support, often labour laws which do not protect pregnant women, no proper sex ed, expensive and/or regulated contraceptives etc etc, which will lead to more pregnancies. And more pregnancies means more abortions.

So if you like abortions and dead women, you should really really make abortions illegal.

If you don’t like abortions, you should do the opposite: institute a program with free or subsidised contraceptives, family planning advice, women’s healthcare, child care, pre-natal care, paid parental leave, strong labour protection laws and so on and so on.

Because every state or country which have those sees abortion rates drop like a rock.

Let us ask a child. The core reason I am pro-life is I have no way to explain abortion to a six-year-old that doesn’t result in them sobbing and crying in empathy. Children see with clarity and have not been corrupted by the rationalizations of preferences.

Child: Daddy, What is abortion?

Dad: Well, when Mommy has a baby in her tummy, sometimes she chooses she doesn’t want it.

Child: Why would Mommy not want a baby? Doesn’t Mommy love that baby as she loves me?

Dad: There can be many reasons; the most common is that Mommy thinks she is not ready to have and care for a baby.

Child: Daddy, what happe

Child: Daddy, what happens to the baby?

Dad: Mommy goes to the doctor and the doctor removes the unborn baby from Mommy’s tummy.

Child: So, the baby is given to someone else?

Dad: No, the unborn baby is killed.

Child: Killed? What does that mean?

Dad: The baby in Mommy’s tummy life is ended; the baby disappears forever, killed by the doctor.

Child: [starting to pout], you mean Mommy went to the doctor to kill the baby in her tummy?

Dad: Yes.

Child: If Mommy did not want me, Mommy would kill me? [full-on sobbing by now]

Dad: No, no, no, you have been born, you are not in her tummy, she isn’t going to kill you.

Child: but (pout), but (pout), you said that if Mommy doesn’t want a child anymore, she can go to the doctor and kill me…(crying).

Dad: Mommy can only kill a baby when the baby is inside her tummy.

Child: When I was in Mommy’s tummy, she could have killed me? (crying)

Dad: Yes.

Child: Please, Daddy, don’t let Mommy kill me, don’t let Mommy take me to the doctor…

Good luck ever taking your child to the doctor. Sometimes children recognize the obvious. Try explaining abortion to a 5- or 6-year-old and not have them cry. It is only an adult’s ability to purposely delude themselves that allows them to rationalize in some fanatically, post-modern fake reality the right to kill an unborn baby for whatever reason. You convince a 5- or 6-year-old of that without them crying and being honest with them, good luck. The unclouded purity of a child’s eyes does contain wisdom. So, to the question, yes, I think elective abortion should be restricted by law.
