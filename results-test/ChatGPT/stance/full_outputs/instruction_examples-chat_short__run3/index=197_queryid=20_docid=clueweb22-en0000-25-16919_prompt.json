Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Drink Your Nutella: a Healthy Hazelnut Milk Tea Recipe

As someone who likes to be mindful of her health and wellness, I try not to make a habit of frequent desserts — everything in moderation, but of course, I’m human. But one foolproof way I’ve found to strike that ever-elusive health balance we all seek is by letting myself indulge freely in my most favorite treat: tea lattes!

Hazelnut Milk Tea Latte

If you’re new to the world of the tea latte, it’s an easy way to amp up your usual cuppa by brewing an extra-strong half cup of tea, and topping that off with an equal amount of steamed milk. Something about the combination of a favorite tea plus a hint of sweet and the satiating creaminess of frothed milk (coconut milk is especially delightful!) feels like such a treat without the sugar-coma implications. This twist on a traditional tea latte is a Nutella-inspired, healthy hazelnut milk tea recipe that will keep you sipping guiltlessly (and decadently) all day long!

The beauty of this particular brew comes from the tea leaf itself — rather than filling your cup with sugar and calories, that warm, uniquely hazelnut-and-chocolate-y goodness is coming from the aromatic honeybush blend and its accompanying cocoa nibs and hazelnut pieces. Paired with a light sweetener (I’m particularly fond of Plum Deluxe’s caramel agave stick in this recipe, taking those Nutella-inspired flavors to another level) and topped with creamy, frothed milk, you’ve got a healthy hazelnut milk tea recipe that’s as suitable for a rainy morning in your coziest reading nook as it is nightcap-style to compliment your favorite daily bedtime ritual. (Warm milk, anyone?)

Hazelnut Milk Tea Latte

Healthy Nutella Latte

Ingredients:

  • 1.5 teaspoon Plum Deluxe Chocolate Hazelnut Tea
  • 4 ounces of milk of choice
  • Optional: your favorite sweetener

Directions:
Steep your tea leaves in 4 ounces of hot water for around 3-5 minutes.

Meanwhile, warm 4 ounces of your favorite milk to be steamed atop your latte, either on a gentle simmer on the stove, or watching carefully in the microwave. Once your milk is warmed, you can use an appliance like a milk frother or steamer to steam, or just vigorously shake your warmed milk in a sealed mason jar for a minute or two until it’s frothed to your liking.

Once your tea has steeped, remove the leaves and pour into your favorite mug or teacup, add your optional choice of sweetener, and top with equal parts steamed milk. Mmm–a healthy hazelnut tea recipe that’s perfectly reminiscent of Nutella in a mug!
