Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

A bill proposed by 35 Democratic House members in Washington state appears at first glance to be a moot point.

DEMS WANT TO PROHIBIT OPEN-CONCEAL-CARRY IN ELECTION OFFICES

As the 2022 legislative session begins, House Democrats have filed a curious bill.

HB1618 (house bill) would prohibit weapons (not just guns) at election-related offices and such facilities.

Sponsored by Democratic House Rep April Berg of Mill Creek, the bill was officially filed on January 10th.  Part of the test of the bill reads as follows: (from legislative synopsis)

"The carrying and possession of firearms and other specified weapons in certain election offices and facilities is prohibited. Restricted areas include ballot counting centers, voting centers, student engagement hubs, county elections and voter registration offices, and areas of facilities used as a ballot counting center, voting center, student engagement hub, or county elections and voter registration office."

This would not apply to law enforcement officers. There are other specified weapons such as Tasers etc. but it's firearms that come into focus here.

WA Law already restricts bringing guns into schools, airports, bars, taverns, jails and courthouses, and (with a few exceptions) mental health facilities.

 WHY IS THIS BILL CURIOUS?

With Washington being a vote-by-mail state, there are not exactly a lot of people who go to election-related venues. Adding "election-related" facilities to the list is...curious.

This bill would require modifying the already existing RCW laws in adding these election centers to the list.

Already pro-gun advocates are saying this is another small end-around effort to further squeeze the rights of gun owners in WA state. We will see how far it gets.

1919: The National Prohibition Act

U.S. legislation in 1919 passed the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution to prohibit the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. The National Prohibition Act was ratified Jan. 16 and originally vetoed by President Woodrow Wilson, only to be overruled by Congress with a 287-100 vote. The movement for prohibition began with concerns in the early 19th century about the negative effects of drinking. The National Prohibition Act was ineffective and failed to control the distribution and use of alcohol, and led to an increase in organized crime. Still, it remained in effect until the 21st Amendment was passed 14 years later.

1920: The Nineteenth Amendment women's right to vote

On Aug. 18, 1920, women were empowered like never before in the United States after the 19th Amendment was passed. After a fight for women's rights that began more than a century before, the Nineteenth Amendment the women's right to vote was ratified to the U.S. Constitution. The act was passed after a sweeping victory of 304-89 votes 42 more than the required two-thirds majority. On voting day that year, more than 8 million women around the nation showed up to vote for the first time.

1921: The Emergency Quota Act

In an overwhelming vote of 78-1 in favor, the Emergency Quota Act was passed and signed into law May 19 by President Warren G. Harding to restrict immigration in the United States by imposing a temporary quota system. The Act was the first federal law to limit European immigration. It came in on a wave of anti-immigration hysteria following a series of events including the 1919 recession and the resulting high unemployment rates and governmental policy at the time of isolation.

1922: The Cable Act

The Expatriation Act was passed in March of 1907 with a number of impositions, including stipulations that if a woman lived abroad for more than two years or was married to a man who wasn't eligible for citizenship, she could be revoked of her status. The Cable Act of 1922also known as the Married Women's Independent Nationality Act was passed Sept. 22 and allowed women to remain citizens even if they married men who were not.

1923: Meyer v. Nebraska

Probably as a result of World War I and heightened national sentiments, a Nebraska law was put in place forbidding the teaching of any modern language other than English. The law was challenged and overruled, though, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Justice Reynolds, a teacher at Zion Parochial School who had been teaching German to a 10-year-old student, claiming it was an invasion of the 14th Amendment.

1924: Indian Citizenship Act

Citizenship for Native Americans before the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act was hard to come by. Before the Civil War, only those with one-half or less Native American blood were offered citizenship. Most Native American women who had married U.S. citizens were offered citizenship by 1888, and in 1919, veterans of Native American descent who had fought in World War I could naturalize. Even after Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, which was all-encompassing, citizenship rights were still governed by each state and the right to vote was often denied to Native Americans.

1925: Air Mail Act

Mail service was for the first time turned over to private contractors after congressional pressure on the post office with the Air Mail Act of 1925, also known as the Kelly Act. This was the first chess piece to be moved in an effort to accelerate aviation technology and aircraft performance. Under this piece of legislation, eight airline routes were advertised from which carriers could receive up to 80% of postal revenue.

1926: Air Commerce Act

A year later on May 20, Congress approved the Air Commerce Act making the government responsible for air commerce, airways, navigation improvement, and the enforcement of flight safety restrictions. This act opened the floodgates for U.S. expansion and development of its aviation program. Now the U.S. Post Service could pay private airlines for mail delivery services and base payments on shipping weight.

1927: Radio Act

1927: Radio Act

The Radio Act was made official law on Feb. 23 and put the newly established Federal Radio Commission (FRC) in charge of regulating radio. This allowed much tighter restrictions and limitations on broadcasting licenses: The FRC had the power to deny licenses and control frequencies and power levels, unlike the Commerce Department that had previous regulatory powers.

1928: The Kellogg-Briand Pact

In efforts to avoid another World War, The Kellogg-Briand Pact also known as the Pact of Paris was an agreement to outlaw war signed by the United States and 14 other nations. The U.S. Senate ratified the pact in a vote of 85-1, but only after noting that U.S. would still reserve the right to self-defense or to act against any nations that broke the agreement. Later, 47 other countries would sign the pact. Despite this and other anti-war efforts, militarism continued to rise through the 1930s and the break of World War II in 1939.

1929: Permanent Appointment Act

1929: Permanent Appointment Act

As per the U.S. Constitution, each state had at least one Representative and no more than one for every 30,000 people, but there was no clear definition on how large future Congresses for a growing America should be. Before passing the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929, the method for calculating apportionment led to a decrease of representation for smaller, less urbanized states leading to an eruption of battles between rural and urban factions. On June 18, the Permanent Appointment Act was signed into law and capped House membership at the level taken from the 1910 Census, and enacted a procedure to automatically reapportion House seats every 10 years.
