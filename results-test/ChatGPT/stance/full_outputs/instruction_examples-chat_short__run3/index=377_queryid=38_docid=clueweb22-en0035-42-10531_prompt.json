pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Benefits of Having a Medical Cannabis Card in Recreational States

Even if you live in a recreational-use state, there are several advantages to becoming a medical marijuana patient.

Fewer Restrictions

Recreational cannabis is typically limited to patients over 21 years of age and comes with strict possession limits. As a medical marijuana patient, you face fewer restrictions and have more freedom to access your medication in greater quantities.

Greater Selection

A medical marijuana card affords you the privilege of shopping in both medicinal and adult-use dispensaries. Greater access means more products to choose from and more freedom to compare prices and find the best deals.

More Protection

Some recreational-use states still allow employers, landlords, and family courts to discriminate against cannabis users. A medical marijuana certification provides you with legal documentation demonstrating that your use is medically warranted. This can protect you against discriminatory or punitive actions in many states.

Better Prices

As a medical marijuana patient, you won’t be subject to the same sales or excise taxes required of recreational buyers. You may be able to save 10% or more on every purchase.

Proudly featured in:

In many cases, yes. Some states are allowing telemedicine evaluations. This means that you can complete your physician’s evaluation online and then apply for your medical marijuana card. The card—or at least the temporary card—is usually delivered via email, so you can complete every step of the registration process without leaving home. Telemedicine is not available in all states.
