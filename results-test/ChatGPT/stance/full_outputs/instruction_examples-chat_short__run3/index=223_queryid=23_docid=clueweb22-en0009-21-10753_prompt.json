Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Euthanasia & Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS) around the World

Euthanasia (in which a doctor administers a lethal dose of medication to a patient) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are illegal in most countries. However, several countries have legalized one or both of the practices. Below, find a sampling of countries and the legal precedents concerning euthanasia and PAS.

These countries were chosen based on the availability of legal documents and information on medical practices, and an effort to include countries that represent a variety of cultures, religions, and ethnicities. Do not rely on this information without first checking with a current and official edition of the applicable law.

Australia

Euthanasia:

Illegal

(Legal in Victoria)

Physician-Assisted Suicide:

Illegal

The Northern Territory of Australia passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which legalized voluntary euthanasia in 1995. The law went into effect on July 1, 1996 and was used by four Australians who were dying from cancer.  

Two 1996 court challenges, one in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and one in the High Court, resulted in the law being declared valid.

A bill to overturn the Act was introduced at the federal level on Sep. 9, 1996 and passed both Houses by Mar. 25, 1997, when the Northern Territory’s Act was officially overturned, making both euthanasia and PAS illegal in Australia again.

The Green Party introduced the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill of 2013 in Tasmania in an effort to legalize physician-assisted suicide in that state. The bill was defeated in 2013.

On Nov. 29, 2017, Victoria (Australia’s second-most populous state) legalized physician-assisted suicide and limited euthanasia. The law went into effect on June 19, 2019 and allows terminally ill patients (with a life-expectancy of 6 months in most cases) to obtain a lethal drug for self-administration. The law allows the drug to be administered by a doctor if the patient is unable to do so themselves.

Austria

Physician-Assisted Suicide:

Legal*

(as of Jan. 1, 2022)

Euthanasia:

Illegal

In Dec. 2020, Austria’s constitutional court ruled that the legislature was violating fundamental rights by banning assisted suicide and ordered the government to lift the ban that was punishable with up to five years in prison.

On Oct. 23, 2021, Austria’s government announced plans to legalize physician-assisted suicide in 2022. Two doctors, one specializing in palliative care, will have to review each case and a 12-week waiting period will apply unless the patient is in the terminal phase of their illness. The legislation will be reviewed by experts and is expected to be put in place by the end of 2021. If regulations are not in place by Jan. 1, 2022, the ban will simply be lifted, leaving assisted-suicide unregulated but legal.

Belgium

Euthanasia:

Legal

Physician-Assisted Suicide:

Legal

The Belgian Act on Euthanasia of May 28, 2002 went into effect on Sep. 3, 2002, legalizing both euthanasia and PAS for “competent” adults and emancipated minors suffering from “constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated.” The patients do not have be suffering from terminal illnesses. On Feb. 13, 2014, the law was extended to minors. Belgium was the second country to legalize euthanasia, after the Netherlands in 2001.

Canada

Euthanasia:

Legal

Physician-Assisted Suicide:

Legal

Suicide has been decriminalized in Canada since 1972, but a provision criminalizing suicide assistance remained in the Criminal Code and was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) in 1993.  

In June 2014, Quebec passed Bill 52, legalizing euthanasia but not physician-assisted suicide.

In a unanimous decision on Feb. 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the prohibition on assisting suicide, giving the Canadian Parliament a year to pass a law legalizing and regulating physician-assisted suicide and, possibly, euthanasia. The Court extended the deadline four months to allow then-incoming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration to draft a law. Bill C-14 passed the House of Commons but was in the Senate when the June 6, 2016 deadline passed, legalizing PAS (and possibly euthanasia) without legislative regulation.

The Court ruling stated that “‘physician-assisted death’ and ‘physician-assisted dying’ [are used] to describe the situation where a physician provides or administers medication that intentionally brings about the patient’s death at the request of the patient.” While physician-administered medication that results in death is generally referred to as “euthanasia,” the Court does not make that distinction, which made their ruling unclear about which practice is legal.

On June 18, 2016 C-14 was passed by the Senate, making assisted suicide (and possibly euthanasia) legal effective immediately and regulating physician-assisted suicide and, possibly, euthanasia. The law states, “medical assistance in dying means (a) the administering by a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner of a substance to a person, at their request, that causes death; or (b) the prescribing or providing by a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner of a substance to a person, at their request, so that they may self-administer the substance and in doing so cause their own death.”

Eligible persons must be citizens or permanent residents of Canada, at least 18-years-old, and have a “grievous and irremediable medical condition.”

China

Euthanasia:

Illegal

Physician-Assisted Suicide:

Illegal

Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are illegal in China under Articles 232 and 233 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China: “Article 232 Whoever intentionally commits homicide shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 10 years; if the circumstances are relatively minor, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than 10 years.” And, “Article 233 Whoever negligently causes death to another person shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years; if the circumstances are relatively minor, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Law.”  

In Mar. 1994 a group of China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) legislators proposed euthanasia laws but they were not passed. In Mar. 2007, a woman with muscular dystrophy had a television journalist broadcast her proposal for euthanasia legislation during the NPC annual session.

Colombia

Euthanasia:

Legal

Physician-Assisted Suicide:

Illegal

Euthanasia became legal in Colombia on May 20, 1997 when the Constitutional Court (the country’s highest court), ruled (6-3) that a person may choose suicide and that physicians could not be prosecuted for helping by passing Article 326 of the 1980 Penal Code. The Court ruled against the plaintiff, Jose Euripides Parra Parra, who brought the case to the Court hoping to have euthanasia declared unconstitutional, stating “Tendencies of totalitarian fascist and Communist States are reflected in mercy killing, they respond to Hitler’s and Stalin’s ideas; where the weakest, the most seriously ill are lead and condemned to the gas chambers, to probably ‘help them die better.’” The Court instead asserted, “in the case of a terminally ill [person]… no responsibility should be attributed to the acting physician, as his conduct is justified.” The Court asked that Congress legislate the act, but Congress did not, thus putting the legalization on hold for eight years until the Health Ministry was instructed to release guidelines, which it did on Apr. 20, 2015, officially legalizing euthanasia in Colombia.
