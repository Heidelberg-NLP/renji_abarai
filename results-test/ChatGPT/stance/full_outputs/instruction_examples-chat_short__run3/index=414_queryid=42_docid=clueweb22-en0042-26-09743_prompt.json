con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should fight allow hockey
Text: "I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out." - Rodney Dangerfield

Fighting is part of the game of hockey; some would consider it the game's most iconic feature. The NHL has been working in recent years on cleaning up and regulating fights. As a result they aren't quite what they used to be, but still remain a very fun part of the game. It allows teams to show their disapproval with their opponent's style of play beyond harsh words and petty shoving.

There are a few different types of fights. Some never really get going, with both players skating in circles waiting for the other to make a move. Or they might just hug each other for a bit. The refs end up getting bored and pull them apart.

Some are more of a show than anything, where players are trying to stimulate their team or their fans. Both players try to land a few punches and then get out. They're often just light hearted fights that don't mean much other than job security for two enforcers.

But then there are the fights that every hockey fan lives for. Fights where it looks like both players are trying to murder each other. It isn't staged, and they hold nothing back. It's raw emotion fueling the fight. These are the types of fights make the best and most brutal brawls.

20 20. Zack Smith v Nathan Horton- April 9, 2011

As the announcers make clear, this game is not significant. It occurred one day before the official end of the regular season with Boston having already secured the division win, and Ottawa being eliminated.

This isn't two enforcers fighting to give themselves job security; this is two guys fighting because they hate each other (at least in the moment). Both players land some nice hits on each other, but neither goes down.

It makes for a great fight because it's real. These two have to settle something and they do just that.

19 19. Atlanta Thrashers vs. Boston Bruins - December 23, 2010

It's pretty clear to see what kicked all this off. Meyer hits Lucic high and everyone pairs off. The announcers were talking about Meyer's hit being a possible suspension. Instead, all the talk afterwards was about whether Lucic would be suspended for the punch he threw that sent Meyer to the ice just before all the fighting broke out. In the end, Lucic was given a $3,500 fine, but no suspension.

18 18. Tanner Glass vs. Cody McCormick - November 8, 2011

Short and sweet. It was quite a bit more fun than those fights that start off strong and then slowly dwindle in to a passionate hug. Glass and McCormick threw everything they had into it before falling to the ice, ending the brawl.

It appeared McCormick got the better hits in, but he also came away from it bloodier and with less equipment.

17 17. Montreal Canadiens vs. Ottawa Senators - May 5th 2013

Game 3 of the 2013 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals saw the Senators leading the Canadiens by a score of 4-1 with about 13 minutes left in the 3rd. A couple slashes and a shove was enough to set everything off in a brawl that resulted in over 200 penalty minutes being dealt.

All things considered, the refs did a very nice job handling 4 simultaneous fights. Not a terrible amount occurred after everything got cleaned up.

16 16. David Driurzynski vs. Frazer McLaren - March 6, 2013

This fight got started less than a minute into the hockey game. Both players got a few decent hits in to start, but McLaren finishes it pretty early on when he sends Dziurzynski to the ice.

Driurzynski stays down, something that is always hard to watch. It takes him a minute to get back up, needing the help of him teammates to get off the ice. It was later announced that he had received a concussion; though his symptoms were not severe at least.

15 15. Vancouver Canucks vs. Calgary Flames - April 17, 2015

Between Derek Dorsett and Dan Hamhuis ganging up on Deryk Engelland and Matt Stajan being thrown to the ice, this scrum got very heated.

Surprisingly, Hamhuis didn't get a suspension for being the third man in. The rational seemed to be that it wasn't technically a fight at that point. With punches being thrown and everyone having their gloves off by the time they went down, it's hard to understand that point of view.

14 14. Philadelphia Flyers vs. Pittsburgh Penguins - April 1 2012

With one minute left in a game that was already decided, Pittsburgh sent out of their 4th line. Briere took a legal but unnecessary hit that enraged the flyers.

The best part of all this was seeing the two coaches standing on the bench yelling at each other. It's a shame they didn't switch to Pierre so the fans could get a listen in on what they were saying, I'm sure everyone would've enjoyed that; everyone except parents who were watching the game with younger kids perhaps.

13 13. John Erskine vs. Eric Boulton - November 14, 2010

This fight was definitely one of the better ones in recent years. Neither player was pulling punches; rather they were swinging for the one knockout punch.

Both Erskine and Boulton landed some hard shots that would've sent most players down, but not these two heavyweights. Erskine got the last hit in with a shove into the boards, but no clear winner emerged from the fight.

12 12. Jay Rosehill vs. Brian McGratton - November 17, 2011

How Rosehill stayed standing after taking a couple dozen punches to the head is completely beyond me. Neither player was concerned with blocking, or anything related to defense for that matter. It was a fight where the only goal seemingly was to land has many shots to the head as possible.

It didn't take much to get this fight going, the heavy weights pairing up after the two teams got into a minor scrum.

11 11. Matt Cooke vs. Evander Kane - April 10, 2010

Evander Kane Answers Matt Cooke's challenge and ends it almost immediately. Cooke goes down hard and it takes a while for him to get up but does eventually leave the ice on his own.

While many consider Cooke to be a dirty player, it's still always hard to watch a player go down like that. Following this, Cooke was listed as day-to-day with a suspected concussion.

10 10. Buffalo Sabres vs. Toronto Maple Leafs - September 22, 2013

The strangest thing about everything that happened here is that it occurred during a preseason game. These types of fights aren't supposed to happen in meaningless games.

It was started off after a fight between Jamie DeVane and Corey Tropp that sent Tropp down hard. It was followed up by 2015 all-star John Scott trying to pick a fight with Phil Kessel, who rejected the fight in completely hilarious and absurd fashion by hold his stick like it's a sword and swinging at Scott's legs.

It even featured a goalie fight, one that both went all in on. Seldom do all 6 players on the ice go at it - it happening during a preseason game is even more surprising. It's absurd that all this went down. In the end, Clarkson received a 10 game suspension for coming off the bench; Kessel got 3 for his ridiculous slashing.

For what it's worth, Toronto won the game 5-3.

9 9. Jarome Iginla vs. Jamie Benn - December 23, 2010

It's always fun to see two talented players go at it. At first it looked like one of those fights where both players skate around each other in circles before the refs get bored and pull them apart. Benn thankfully ruins that thought when he dives in swinging for Iginla.

Iginla had the stronger finish. However, overall it felt like Benn did more damage, the majority of it coming early on in the fight.

8 8. Andrew Ladd vs. Gabriel Landeskog - December 11, 2014

Watching the enforcers go at it can be fun, two big guys who know how to fight smacking each other, and most would probably agree that these are the best types of hockey fights. Two leaders going at it. Two guys who aren't known to fight absolutely tearing into each other.

Landeskog had Ladd beat in this one, partially due to Ladd's hand getting stuck in his jersey of course, but still.

Though, someone should tell them that if you wear a visor, you're supposed to take it off before you fight.

7 7. B.J. Crombeen vs. Zac Rinaldo - February 5th, 2013

Zac Rinaldo is a terrifying player. He plays like he wants to knock someone out whenever he's on the ice (especially when he was in Philadelphia). While he's not known for his fighting ability, he might have just went into this one bent on beating someone up.

While if you slow it down, you'll see his last hit lands before Crombeen hits the ice. If you want to get technical about it, you could make the case that it wasn't a dirty hit. But for all intents and purposes it was due to Crombeen being out of the fight at that point. Either way it, was hard to watch.

6 6. Vancouver Canucks vs. Calgary Flames - January 18, 2014

This was absolute madness. Calgary decided to start the game with their 4th line (their tough guys), Vancouver responded with theirs. As soon as the puck dropped, everyone paired up and threw down. This is the kind of thing that happens when you have heated rivalries in the NHL. Watching Tortorella (as well as some of his other players) yell across the benches makes this whole thing so much better.

5 5. Ilya Kovalchuk vs. Brayden Schenn - February 4, 2012

Following a dirty slew foot by Rinaldo on Parise, a relatively minor scrum ensues. Out of it, the young Brayden Schenn bit off way more than he could chew; getting literally thrown around before being dropped to his knees by veteran Ilya Kovalchuk.

Amazingly, it looks like Schenn came out of the fight alright. At the very least, the Flyers made no announcement of any sort of injury. It's a shame that Rinaldo never had to answer for his own dirty play.

4 4. Antoine Roussel v Andrew Shaw - December 3rd, 2013

Antoine Roussel and Andrew Shaw square off right out of the draw. The two certainly want to go at it a lot longer than the refs wanted them two. Roussel and Shaw continue to wail on each other despite the linesmen getting in between them.
