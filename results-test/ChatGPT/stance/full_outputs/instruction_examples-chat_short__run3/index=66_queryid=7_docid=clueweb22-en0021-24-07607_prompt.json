con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

I am going to make a few assumptions here. I am assuming you mean a US felon, and your crimes were not particularly heinous.

From a personal, specific example, I was able to visit Canada while I was still on parole. Now, I didn't just go to this country for the lulz. I was going to attend an international plasma science conference where I was giving a presentation. Canada, howevwe, doesn't particularly like felons, and they may have let me in because of the reason I needed to attend. I got permission from my parole offericer, which also required special permission from the state. I was a model

A lot of other countries are pretty receptive to felons, and even if they are not, you can fill out paperwork and get a definitive answer.

If you have international drug trafficking charges, I don't think the US will even issue you a passport. I'm not sure about sex crimes either.

In all, a lot if these questions could be answered by going to the country's tourist website and clicking something along the effect of “visit country x.” Sometimes the felon part is in the FAQ, or you could call the embassy.

My personal experience leads to one point though: what is the reason for your visit? Are you visiting Columbia for 1 day to go to your brothers wedding, a la the movie Blow? This could send up red flags. Are you visiting for about a week to present your work on triggering wide bandgap photoconductive semiconductor switches with a portable LED device? They may give you the benefit of the doubt in that case

There isn’t much information as a lot of countries do not allow people with felonies in their country. You can visit some but there’s gonna be a lot of papers. It also has a little to do with the strength of your passport. For example, it’s easier for a person with a German passport to get in the USA than someone with a passport from Iraq. (I don’t know why).

I’ll put in a link from a website that explains traveling with felonies

Travelling with a criminal history

This might sound unconventional, but hands down I’d go with blue-chip art. A Basquait painting soared 2,209,900% when it was bought for $5,000 and sold for $110,500,000. And if you think that is crazy, a Leonardo Da Vinci painting skyrocketed 5,328,894%. Although not guaranteed, if you can f

Some will be prosecuted and be sent to prison. The vast majority will be released, either because the charges were dismissed outright, or they were allowed to plea bargain down to a non gun related crime, such as second degreed jaywalking. General speaking, the only people who the federal government prosecutes with real enthusiasm are law abiding citizens who violate some silly technicality in the many gun laws.

A few years ago, I was having lunch at the counter of a Denny’s Restaurant in South Tucson when I overheard a fascinating conversation. As he manned the register and served the customers at the counter during the lunch hour rush, the Manager of the Denny’s was talking to a young man. The young man was scruffy-looking and had a hang-dog look.

Paraphrasing the Manager:

“Fifteen years ago, I was standing exactly where you are now, and in the same situation. I had just been released from prison and...

Also, in an increasing number of states, felon applicants can't be excluded from higher positions. A Harvard grad with an J.D. could lose out to a chicken farmer with child abuse convictions.

None. A convicted felon can never legally own a gun. Not only convicted felons, but also convicted domestic violence offenders when some States classify it as a misdemeanor. I have an acquaintance who had a court overturn, so he says, his domestic violence conviction. If true he could then legally purchase and own a gun. America does not need more gun laws, just enforce with vigor the present laws and in my opinion, we need more legal gun owners not fewer.

Yes. Criminal convictions cross state lines.

Historically (long before the US was a nation) it was considered that someone convicted of a felony lost their civil rights in general. Indeed, the original idea was really that a felony was a crime that came with a death sentence. (This was also before prisons).

As time has marched on, we’ve increasingly “felonized” various and sundry crimes, and largely defined them as crimes with long(ish) prison sentences.

Many people have expressed the idea that as such, it makes no sense to remove the rights of so many people, and that the firearms prohibition should be restricted to those convicted of vio

Many people have expressed the idea that as such, it makes no sense to remove the rights of so many people, and that the firearms prohibition should be restricted to those convicted of violent felonies. We may see a case before SCOTUS in this regard soon.

Do you mean while in prison or after release?

AFAIK every European country conforms to the world norm, i.e. that once a criminal has served his or her sentence, they can vote on the same terms as before conviction.

Voting rights may be restricted while in prison.

Note that ‘felon’ does not have the same definition in other countries as in the USA. Classifications of crimes & criminals differ.

They can visit here without any problem as long as they have a valid US passport. There are no visa requirements so entry is easy enough.

Living here is different as there is likely to be a bit more checking however it would depend what the felony was. The American criminal justice system is not like one in a normal country and people can be convicted and jailed for minor offences if they are poor or black.

Question: Can felons from the USA move to another country?

Legally?

Very rarely.

It helps if they are wealthy, if the crimes are nonviolent and not drug offenses, and if the person is a lower profile felon. If they are garden variety felons (and in some cases people who simply have misdemeanors like DUIs) they are probably going to be rejected if they attempt to apply for asylum or try to emigrate there.

Some countries (the Philippines, Mexico, Ecuador, etc.) will allow short-term, no visa stays by people who have felony records. Although the person cannot become a citizen or legal permanent resid

Some countries (the Philippines, Mexico, Ecuador, etc.) will allow short-term, no visa stays by people who have felony records. Although the person cannot become a citizen or legal permanent resident, they can leave and return multiple times over an extended period of time. There are people who do this and who for all intents and purposes “live” in those countries.

Depends on the laws of the other countries, Many figure they have enough problems with their own criminals, and don’t want any more. You did not say what country, so we really can’t answer.

Australia.

In Australian states, the Commissioner of Police has a very great deal of discretion on who they issue licenses to. In a few cases the Commissioner has issued to clearly reformed former offenders.

We have provisions that appear very sensible; restraining orders or Apprehended Violence orders against you will see your legal guns removed, but they also take them from the person suffering violence!
