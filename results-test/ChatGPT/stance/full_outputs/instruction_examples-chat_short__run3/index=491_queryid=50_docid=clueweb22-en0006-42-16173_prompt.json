Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should everyone get universal basic income
Text: Universal basic income: Wales' trial 'should include everyone'

Universal basic incomes gives a regular sum to everyone, regardless of their income

Supporters of universal basic income have called for a trial in Wales to include everyone living in a test area.

UBI pays everyone a fixed sum, regardless of their circumstances.

The Welsh government has said its small trial could involve people leaving the care system.

In an open letter to the first minister, signatories, including the future generations commissioner, said it needed to cover geographical areas for it to be an effective test.

Trials have taken place in Finland and California, with a 12-year project running in Kenya.

Critics argue it would be better to invest in better public services or existing benefits and point to the cost of applying a scheme across a whole country.

But in their letter, supporters said the welfare system was "not fit for purpose".

They said specific geographical areas, such as council wards, should be used alongside the proposals for those leaving care.

In that way, they argue, the potential benefits and pitfalls could be assessed.

Some high profile celebrities, including billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, have backed the idea, while the UK Labour Party said it would explore a pilot of UBI in its 2019 general election manifesto.

'Horrible, horrible situation'

Phillip Easton lives in Penrhiwceiber, Rhondda Cynon Taf, an area with high rates of child poverty.

He runs a business selling hot chocolate, but when he was setting it up, he had a stroke.

He said the security blanket of UBI would have made a real difference.

"During that time, because I was doing little things, I was not able to claim universal credit, but I was in a horrible, horrible situation back then and if I could have just taken that time at the beginning of my business and sit back and properly take care of myself it would have been a very different situation.

"There's been a couple of points in my life where guaranteed money - where I don't really have to think about it - would have been really, really handy, especially after the stroke.

"It's left me with a couple of issues with the brain, I can't deal with paperwork easily, especially if it's new paperwork and those forms are not very easy and when lockdown came around and I potentially could have claimed for universal credit, I didn't."

Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said keeping people well "means doing new things to tackle poverty".

"It's time to accept the system is broken and, without a stronger safety net, generations to come will be left with a legacy of deprivation.

"UBI could protect not just those hit hard by Covid but every one of us from other shocks to come - like the climate emergency that's going to cause more devastation via extreme weather like heatwaves and floods."

Other signatories include Jonathan Rhys Williams, co-founder of UBI Lab Wales, Guy Standing, co-founder of Basic Income Earth Network, Cerys Furlong, chief executive of gender equality charity Chwarae Teg and Catherine Fookes, director of Women's Equality Network Wales.

The Welsh government says it is important to get the trial right

A Welsh government spokeswoman said it would listen to key stakeholders and was already working with Ms Howe's office.

"We have closely followed the progress of pilots around the world with interest and believe there is an opportunity to test a version in Wales," she said.

"We understand the excitement and the interest around this policy, however, it is important that we get it right - there is more work to be done in this area but we are interested in developing a version, potentially first involving people leaving care."

The UK government said it has no plans to follow suit.

"It would not incentivise work, target those most in need in society, or work for those who need more support, such as disabled people and those with caring responsibilities," a spokesman said about UBI in May.
