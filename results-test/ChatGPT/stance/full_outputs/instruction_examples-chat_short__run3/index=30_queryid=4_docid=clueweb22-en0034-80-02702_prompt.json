Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Parents Use Corporal Punishment

Good Essays
There have been many discussions on whether spanking or corporal punishment is a manifestation of abuse to children or whether it should be used to discipline a child. In today’s society many parents thinks that spanking a child is one of the better approaches to correct him/her if that child has done something that the parent believes is not right. Part of the problem is that everyone characterizes spanking, or corporal punishment differently. “Corporal punishment is the use of physical force with the intention of causing a child to experience pain but not injury for the purposes of correction or control of the child’s behavior” (Gershoff, 2002).

The definition of abuse coincided with the definition of Corporal punishment, which will cause harm to a child during the disciplining process. So the question remains, should parents use Corporal Punishment to discipline their children? Parents who use these kind of punishment to discipline their children, thinks that it is a good method for discipline them. They feel that at a specific age, kids can’t comprehend reasoning, hence, hitting or whipping is the main dialect can use instantly. These sorts of discipline are just compelling on a transient premise getting kids to stay in line or adjust their negative ways. As a mother, I can confess to this from experience the only thing that spanking stop is the behavior right away. I was spanked as a child but five minutes later I will return to doing the same thing that I was spanked for. Hence the reason children do not learn anything from being spanked. Why might that be? That’s because as parents we never truly taught our children about ethics and values, or what we as parents are anticipating from them. We immediately penalize them and did not take the time to teach them why they did something
