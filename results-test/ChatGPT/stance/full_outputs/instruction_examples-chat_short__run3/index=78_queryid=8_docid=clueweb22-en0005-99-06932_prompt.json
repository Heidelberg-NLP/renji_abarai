Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Supporting Paragraph

The contemporary world faces a spectrum of ethical problems, which resonate in every country and city. Abortion is known to be a controversial and universal issue nowadays, gathering the so-called “armies” of supporters and opponents to take part in an ethical war. Although facing a peak of a stir in modern society, the notion of abortion has actually existed for centuries in every populated place on earth. However, most of the time of its existence, the aforesaid notion was considered sinful, culpable and illegal. It was not until January 22, 1973, that abortions were legalized in the United States, in accordance with women’s right to freedom of choice.

The responsibility of a woman’s life has long been taken off man’s shoulders, hence, enabling women to make their own decisions. Given the fact that abortions concern primarily women’s lives and their bodies at first hand, the choice of performing an abortion should be given to women in the first place because no one else can decide what is better for the person, except the person herself. If pregnancy is unplanned and a child is unwanted, if a woman does not feel capable of providing the child with a nurturing environment or is simply psychologically not ready to become a mother, it is her right to decide on an abortion.

Moreover, medical factors may also impact personal decisions to perform aforesaid surgery. In case an unborn child is diagnosed with pathology, or if labor endangers the life of the mother, abortion is the solution most people would consider wise. In addition, if the mother suffers from an incurable disease, such as HIV/AIDS, which can be passed on to her child, abortion is often considered beneficial.

Furthermore, the notion of abortion is closely related to the problem of crime. One of the most cogent arguments for abortion is the case when a woman was impregnated as a result of rape or incest. In these circumstances, a woman’s desire to have an abortion is completely natural and understandable, since rape is a highly traumatic experience that most people wish to forget about as quickly as possible. Apart from that, abortions are considered a tempering factor for the crime rate. Research has shown that children born to women, who sought an abortion, are at the highest risk to be engaged in criminal activities, by reason of the lack of proper care they might experience (Donohue III and Levitt 381). Hence, after abortions were legalized, the crime rate has lowered because the number of potential criminals has decreased.

Social factors, among others, also support the pro-abortion viewpoint. The financial state of a woman is crucial for her decision to either keep a baby or not. Many prefer to have an abortion than have a child suffer from poverty and parents’ neglect. Also, in many countries and some religious traditions, teenage pregnancy or the notion of a single mother provokes immense social condemnation, making it hard to deal with; thus, abortion appears more appealing. Moreover, if a woman who seeks abortion gives birth to her child, it absolutely does not guarantee she will actually keep it. Numerous instances reveal how women attempt to get rid of their children, and placing them in an orphanage (the limited capacity of which is very often exceeded) is the best, but not the only outcome of the given situation.

Conclusion

Thus, a series of arguments suggests logical justification of the performance of abortions, being opposed to the traditional ethical restrictions. However, the problem is that in case if prohibited, abortions would still be implemented. Instead of the hospitals with proper equipment, they may be performed in some secret and unsanitary environment, hence, jeopardizing women’s lives greatly. Hence, apart from the aforementioned logical reasons, abortions should be legal in order to be kept safe.
