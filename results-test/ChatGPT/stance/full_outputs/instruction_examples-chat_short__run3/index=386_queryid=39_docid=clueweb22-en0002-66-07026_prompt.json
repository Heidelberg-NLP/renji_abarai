none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Michigan Minimum Wage to Increase in 2022

On January 1, 2022, the minimum wage in Michigan will increase to $9.87 per hour. This is a 22-cent increase from the current rate of $9.65 per hour, and the first increase in Michigan since 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

Michigan law requires automatic annual increases in the minimum hourly wage on January 1 of each year, up to $12.05 through 2030. However, the law also states that when the unemployment rate in Michigan exceeds 8.5 percent for the calendar year before the planned increase, the annual increase will automatically be delayed and there will be no increase in the minimum wage. In 2020, the unemployment rate in Michigan reached 9.9 percent, and as a result the minimum wage did not increase in January 2021.

The state also announced that in 2022 the minimum hourly wage rate for tipped employees will increase 8 cents from $3.67 per hour to $3.75 per hour. Likewise, the minimum hourly wage for employees 16-17 years of age will increase by 19 cents to $8.39 per hour.

Michigan employers will be responsible for paying any shortfalls to an employee if the employee’s hourly rate, including gratuities, does not equal or exceed the new minimum wage requirements.
