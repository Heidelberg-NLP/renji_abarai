Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

    Hi, I'm not very smart with electronics so I'm asking for your help. Might be a stupid one, but better to be safe. So I've been vaping for a few months now and always charged my vape with the USB cable from my laptop ( I have iJust 3 ) . So the thing is that I'll soon a take a vacation, and I'm not gone take my laptop with me , just to charge my vape, So I'm wondering if I can charge it with my phone charger, I have 2 different phone chargers, One is with Output - 5V=1500mA , and other one is with Output - 5.0V=1000mA, So can I use any of them to charge my vape from wall socket? The iJust 3 apparently has some sort if charging safety features, and looking up on google, a lot of people are saying that u can charge it, but to be safe, I rather ask here.

    :)

    It should be fine - I think the important bit is 5V. The iJust will only take the current (mA) it needs.

    I sometimes use a 5V 2A charger and it doesn't seem to cause problems.

    Someone will correct me if I'm wrong!

    You are correct, the device will draw what it needs. Using a 2A charger is actually better IMO, even if the device doesn't draw 2A. If you draw the max current (or higher) from a charger, then you are stressing it.

    All of my plug in adapters these days are 2A.

    But I'll definitely watch it so it doesn't overheat.

    Just be sure to charge it on a flame resistant surface, like on the bathroom countertop. Should something go bad, it can be dramatic.

    totally fine, as others told, be sure the surface, and also, a fresh place would be another thing to consider, i always charge my batteries close by a fan at my office desk...

    The iJust 3 has circuit protection so you don't have to worry about over-charging it. However, the Smok Stick X8 is also advertised having circuit protection :eek:. Overheating is usually the main cause of battery explode so if you want to be safe. Just check your iJust after 1 or 2 hours to see if it's too hot.
