Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should adult have right carry conceal handgun
Text: Can you conceal carry an AR15? - Quora
10 Answers

Can you conceal carry an AR15?

In my state (PA), yes.

Put that AR-15 in your car (loaded and accessible) and you are now “carrying concealed”.

As far as actually concealing it from view, on your person? That is a bit trickier - and would require at least a very long coat.

If it’s legal to conceal carry where you are, yes.

It would certainly be difficult but I suppose possible. I think they make custom options for that, but sheesh. It’s not a small gun!

In some states maybe, but not exactly sure how you would conceal carry a rifle thats over 30″ long weighting 7 pounds or so.

Yes you can legally, however to practically carry one you need a custom built AR Pistol and holster rig, and they are very different to carry than let's say my FN57, in states that have a conceal carry license (or whatever they are called in your state) I can carry this weapon

AR Pistols: Legality, Practicality, and Limitations - USA Carry

My FN57 shoots a 5.7x28 round, and it's as close to a 5.56 as you can get and still deep conceal it

I guess if you have a long coat. A little impractical dont ya think?

A few options come to mind:

If we are talking about an AR Pistol with a short barrel (10 inches, maybe?). It might be practical to carry it under a coat, or in a backpack/sling-bag, depending upon circumstances. Some jurisdictions allow the carry of ANY pistol if you have a CCW permit, or if the state is a “Constitutional Carry” jurisdiction.

Otherwise, the definition of “concealed” might vary, depending upon what you are after. In many (certainly not all) US jurisdictions, it’s perfectly legal to carry an AR-15 “concealed” in a locked container … perhaps a guitar case/bag, or something smaller

In many (certainly not all) US jurisdictions, it’s perfectly legal to carry an AR-15 “concealed” in a locked container … perhaps a guitar case/bag, or something smaller for an AR pistol. “Locked” could mean a combination lock where you would only have to spin one dial to the next number. An AR rifle or pistol could be effectively deployed from such a container pretty quickly. I know of some undercover cops and/or executive protection types who do exactly this, as well as couple of guys who bring a “guitar case” to work … or a “messenger bag”. A number of companies make bags designed for this purpose.

So, in terms of legalities, it depends upon where you are and what your intended use-case is. It’s not really practical (IMHO) as a self-defense weapon for everyday carry.

I’m only 6′2″ so I’m not big enough to carry that off. I stop with the biggest being 8 3/8″ N frame S&W in a vertical shoulder holster.

I will go by the legal definition of concealed carry in most states. At this time all states have passed laws that allow qualifying individuals to carry concealed. Even though the laws have pass there are still a few states that either have not yet issued any permits or have made it extremely difficult to obtain one. Most states specifically state that their CCW, concealed carry weapon, permit only pertain to a hand gun, either revolver or semiautomatic, defined as a gun that is held and fired by one hand. The CCW, do not cover other weapons like, brass knuckles, knives, ice picks, rifles, sho

The CCW, do not cover other weapons like, brass knuckles, knives, ice picks, rifles, shotguns and so on. There are 12 states where anyone can carry concealed, Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota,Vermont, west Virginia, Wyoming. There are 15 states at this time that have constitutional carry laws allowing the states individuals to carry either open or concealed. North Carolina has the law in legislature, and passed the house in 2017 and is in the Senate. Even if it pass there will still be the option for CCW permits as the law if passed would only pertain to the state. I carry concealed, and the permit allows me to carry concealed in a total of 38 states do to reciprocity. NC honors all CCW’s . So by most state laws if the AR-15 is a long gun then it is not legal to carry concealed but if it is the pistol conversion then it would be if you could actually carry it concealed which would be quite a feet to accomplish considering the size. Hiding an elephant behind a potted plant comes to mind.

It might be possible in pistol configuration. Using an 8″ barrel, folding stock adaptor, no brace, 10-round magazine, pop-up iron sights, you could probably get it small enough to conceal under heavy clothing.

The extra steps of unfolding the receiver extension and flipping up the sights would make it less practical than a standard pistol.

As far as legality, you would need to consult an attorney where you live.

In the state of Pennsylvania, am I allowed to carry an unloaded AR-15 in the car with me with a concealed weapons permit? Also, can I carry them in public places as well with the permit?

In PA, you require no “permit” to carry openly (any lawfully owned firearm). And everywhere in the state that it is not specifically illegal for you to carry any weapon (schools, post office, courthouse, etc.). The one exception is in the City of Philadelphia (under PA Law - a “city of the first class”) - where they require you to have a PA LTCF (Pennsylvania Licence To Carry Firearms) to carry openly or conc

To carry concealed - you must have a PA LTCF (or a “CCW” from a reciprocal state). And this is where the answer to your your question gets a little dicey…

Inside of a car (vehicle) is considered “concealed” if the firearm is loaded and in a place immediately accessible by the occupants.

In the trunk, unloaded is not (normally) an issue. But, I said normally…

For (over) the last four years - it has technically been illegal to carry or transport any firearm, anywhere in the state without a PA LTCF. This is because the laws in PA do not allow anyone to carry a firearm (without a LTCF), anywhere, during a declared state of emergency. The state is currently under two of these “declared state of emergencies”… a recent one for the “china virus”, the older one for the “opiod crisis”.

What this means is that while the governor (small “g” intended) cannot legally close places like “gun shops”, it is still (technically) illegal to transport a firearm without a LTCF… So if you bought one… you could not bring it home from the gun shop without breaking the law.

And in the face of the “pandemic”, trying to get a PA LTCF was VERY difficult.

Now, (a little to his credit, but not really), the governor has said (in both cases) that that “particular provision” of the emergency declaration law would not be enforced… as if he actually had that choice to make (he doesn’t). And to be honest, I think he did not actually finish the statement the way he wanted to … with the word “yet”.

So if you have a PA LTCF, carry that AR anyway you want it, loaded or not, in your car, or on the street, in Philadelphia, or anywhere else it is not illegal to do so. If you do not have a PA LTCF, put it in the trunk… and for now you should be just fine…

Final note: PA has the second highest number of “concealed carry permit holders” in the nation (yes, even beating TX) - specifically because of the stupidity of its “transport laws”. Everyone who owns a firearm in the state should ALSO have an LTCF. The process is so simple as to be meaningless - and if you can purchase/own a firearm in the state, you can get a LTCF. All it will cost you is $20 and a trip to the county courthouse once every five years… it is well worth the “investment” - that is … until the state wises up and gets rid of the waste of time and money that is the LTCF requirement for good.

Well, theoretically You could make it sort of a bolt action. It wouldn’t really be. It would still be a semi auto that just isn’t functioning properly. You are talking about just using the charging handle manually I’m assuming. I have seen it properly turned into a pump action.

The problem in doing that is that You aren’t changing the objectionable part of the rifle. You can get a Remington 742 that looks “correct” to satisfy the anti-gun idiots and still have a semi auto. The problem lies in that it is still black. It still has a high capacity remove able magazine and it looks like a military
