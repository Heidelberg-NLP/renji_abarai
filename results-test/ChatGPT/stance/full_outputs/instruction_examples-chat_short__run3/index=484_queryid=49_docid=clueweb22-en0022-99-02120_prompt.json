Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Police Body Cameras: A tool to keep officers accountable and the 4th Amendment Implications and Issues

It is a well-known fact and it has been advertised in the media that in the last couple of years many police departments across the country started to use body worn cameras as a tool to keep officers and the public accountable and to ensure a higher quality of policing. Boone Police department is one of the firs law enforcement agencies in the area that started using body worn cameras several years ago. Boone Police department is located 1500 Blowing Rock Rd in Boone, North Carolina, and servers the Boone community that includes two major groups the local residents and the Appalachian State University students. With a jurisdiction of approximately 6.07sq miles Boone Police Department employs 37 sworn police officers and 11 civilians. According to their mission statement Boone PD is committed to providing the highest quality of police service to the visitors and residents of Boone.

During my internship with the Boone PD I had the opportunity to see and learn how a law enforcement agency operates. I was assigned to the patrol division and that is where I spent most of my time. During the ride along I had the chance to observe the officer respond to different types of calls, anything from a welfare check and ending with motor vehicle accidents, larceny investigations and robberies. Although interns are encouraged to engage in the daily activities, there is always a legal limit, it depends on the circumstances, and it does not apply just to the interns, it usually applies to any non-sworn civilian. While on patrol I learned the most about police work and criminal procedures just by being there on what we can call the front line of a law enforcement agency. It was a great learning experience because after three years of classwork at AppState, I had the chance to actually observe and contemplate over the things that I have learned in my CJ classes.

Literature Review

In Ariel (2016), the author introduces the idea that two triggers for a social change and the way we review the interactions between the police and the citizens were a series of tragic events such as the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson  and the shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston (Ariel, 2016). Later on, it was found that some other authors supported the same idea in their research. Gonzales (2017) introduces the “Ferguson Effect” and explains the anti-police movement by using Brown`s case in order to explain the goals of this movement. Also, Fan (2017) introduces the cases of Keith Scott who died at an apartment complex by accident. His interaction was with two CMPD officers in plain clothes. The CMPD stated that they clearly and loudly told Scott to drop his gun but he failed to do so. Paul O`Neal, who was shot in Chicago is another victim of police misconduct. O`Neal got shot because the officer saw him reaching into his waistband. The cases above support the idea that interactions that resulted in a lethal outcome are a critical factor that made society demand a reform in how we keep police accountable (Fan, 2017).

The actual data and some results that show the possibility of some improvements in keeping police accountable are provided in Ariel (2016), and it is described as the “Rialto experiment.” This is almost the only experiment of such complexity that is meant to study the influence that the body cameras have on the officers’ decision making. Although plenty of data shows that body cameras reduce the likelihood of an officer using unreasonable force, Ariel (2016) does not provide a specific answer on the fact that the body cameras influence policing in a good or bad way. On the other hand, Lippman (2017) makes the argument that officers often intentionally misuse force because they believe that no one is watching (Lippman, 2017).   Ray & Marsh (2017) supports the same idea that the use of body cameras influences policing positively, especially the interaction with minorities since they are more likely to be the victims of police brutality (Ray & Marsh, 2017).

Freund (2015) studied the body camera issue and the 4th amendment implications by comparing them to other surveillance devices. In his study, he focused on dashboard camera recordings and the surveillance cameras. He later found that the main difference is that where those two devices are usually placed, an ordinary citizen can not have a reasonable expectation of privacy (Freund, 2015).

Nielsen (2016) researched the 4th amendment implications based on the two tests, the common law trespass and the reasonable expectation of privacy test. It was found out since there is no physical trespass involved, then the standard that should be applied is the one that deals with reasonable individual expectations of privacy (Nielsen, 2016).

In his research Pavletic (2018) focuses exclusively on one type of surveillance, aerial surveillance. He found that the length of the recording is one of the critical factors in deciding on whether a recording is too intrusive or not.

Reardon (2013) and Rodman (2016) both did their research on recordings of police officers made by ordinary citizens and the 4th amendment protection that the officers have. Reardon (2013) states that by monitoring the activity of the government officials, citizens that use the recording devices exercise their first amendment right. However, Zurcher v. Stanford Daily permits the seizure of the devices that have been used to record arrests. This ensures the 4th amendment rights of one individual but violates the 1st amendment rights of another (Reardon, 2013).

Law enforcement has always had issues with keeping the police officers accountable and limiting the officer’s discretion. According to Ariel (2016), the necessity for reform appeared a  few years ago when a series of events happened that triggered the public opinion to ask for a change and the lawmakers to come up with a solution. Two of the most significant events were the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. Both of these people died from their interaction with law enforcement. Both officers that killed Brown and Garner did not face any charges, even though there were witnesses and even video footage from the incident (Ariel, 2016, p. 732). These two events had a significant impact on the society and triggered the public to demand body cameras for police officers. Knowing how body cameras can influence the police-citizen interactions is extremely important in order to understand better if it is worth taking someone’s rights in order to benefit public safety.  

The research by Nielsen (2016) supports the argument that the theory of effectiveness of body cameras is relatively straightforward. The footage from the officer’s body camera should provide footage and give the objective evidence of the incident, but most important, it will let the individuals view the event from the officer’s perspective (Nielsen, 2016). Having body cameras may seem like the answer to all the questions, but there are many issues with them as well.

 One of the most significant issues is how do we use those recordings without violating the 4th amendment rights of the citizens? According to Freund (2015) citizens benefit from 4th amendment protection not only while being at home but whenever they are in a public area as well (Freund, 2015, p. 116). The 4th amendment protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure. However, is recording someone a search? How to apply the common law test for trespassing and the reasonable expectation of privacy test? This might be a simple question under normal circumstances. But the real issues appears when we try to answer it from the perspective of using a body camera and how intrusive can law enforcement be when recording someone.

Background: What triggered the need for body cameras?

A  few years ago a New York police officer killed Eric Garner by placing him in a chokehold for an extensive period. About the same time, another male named Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri after his interaction with local police. Those events, as well as the death of Walter Scott, resulted in a series of protests in 2014 (Ariel, 2016, p. 732). Those protests started a phenomenon called the “Ferguson Effect.” The “Ferguson Effect” usually happens after a highly publicized event of an officer misusing deadly force against minority citizens. Moreover, as a result, it makes the police officers ignore their proactive duties and manifest a total unwillingness to perform any law enforcement activity in the African-American community. All this results in a chronic disconnect between community and police (Gonzales, 2017, p.313 ). All those events together resulted in the Obama administration arguing that the use of body cameras could be the reform needed in order to revitalize the police-public relations. Besides the statement, there was a campaign started as well, and its primary purpose was to equip the police departments across the country with body cameras. (Ariel, 2016, p. 732).
