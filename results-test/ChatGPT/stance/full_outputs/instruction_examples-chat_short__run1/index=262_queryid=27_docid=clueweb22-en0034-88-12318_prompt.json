Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Pro & Con Quotes: Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted in the United States?

PRO (yes)

Pro 1

Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, stated in a Nov. 5, 2019 interview with Joe Heim titled “‘The NRA Is Weaker Than They’ve Ever Been,’ Says Founder of Gun Violence Prevention Group Moms Demand Action,” available at washingtonpost.com:

“I’m really frustrated when I see politicians using the same old, tired talking points… You can look at Connecticut, [which] passed background checks on every gun sale and saw gun homicides drop by, I believe, 40 percent and gun suicides dropped by 14 percent….

[W]e know that about 80 percent of gun owners support stronger gun laws like a background check on every gun sale, and only one in 10 gun owners even belongs to the NRA…

Everything we do is research and data-based, so all of the laws that we support and prioritize are based on what would save the most amount of lives. And we know that background checks would save the most amount of lives.”

EJ Montini, columnist at the Arizona Republic, wrote in an Aug. 19, 2019 op/ed titled “It’s Monday. Time to Ignore Demands for Gun Law Changes, Again,” available at azcentral.com:

“A universal background check – no exceptions – would be a start. And a ban on assault-style weapons. And a ban on extended magazines.

None of those proposals has gotten anywhere in the Legislature.

The Republicans in control won’t even pass the buck, putting the issues on the ballot.

They know they would pass, and their benefactors from the gun lobby wouldn’t like that.

It would be even better if the gun regulations were passed in Congress, making the laws apply equally across the nation.”

Sharon Risher, MDiv, Reverend and Spokesperson for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, in a July 28, 2017 article, “Everytown, Moms Demand Action Applaud Rep. Cylburn’s Legislation to Close ‘Charleston Loophole’ That Allowed Charleston Shooter to Obtain Gun without a Complete Background Check,” available at the Moms Demand Action website, stated:

“Two years ago my mother and cousins were gunned down by a white supremacist during a prayer service at their beloved Mother Emanuel Church. That hate-filled man never should have gotten his hands on a gun, and yet, through a loophole, he was able to arm himself and take the lives of nine beautiful church-goers, peacefully in prayer. If a full background check had been completed, my mother, cousins and six other loved ones would still be alive today…

Between 2010 and 2016, the Charleston loophole allowed nearly 23,000 gun sales to dangerous people who would have failed a criminal background check because the check could not be completed within three business days. After the three-day period has expired, federal law allows gun stores to sell a gun to a prospective buyer, even though the background check is not complete…

Background checks that have been completed have blocked more than two million sales to people who failed a background check, and have saved countless lives.”

The American Medical Association, in a June 14, 2016 statement, “AMA Calls Gun Violence ‘A Public Health Crisis;’ Will Actively Lobby Congress to Lift Ban on CDC Gun Violence Research,” available at ama-assn.org, stated:

“With approximately 30,000 men, women and children dying each year at the barrel of a gun in elementary schools, movie theaters, workplaces, houses of worship and on live television, the United States faces a public health crisis of gun violence… Our AMA ‘recognizes that uncontrolled ownership and use of firearms, especially handguns, is a serious threat to the public’s health inasmuch as the weapons are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deaths.’ AMA policy supports legislation calling for a waiting period before purchasing any form of firearm in the U.S., and supports requiring background checks for all handgun purchasers.

Moreover, AMA policy supports stricter enforcement of present federal and state gun safety legislation, and the imposition of mandated penalties for crimes committed with the use of a firearm, including the illegal possession of a firearm.”

Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein, PhD, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a June 14, 2016 statement, “In Wake of Mass Shooting, UN Rights Chief Urges US to Consider Robust Gun Control,” available at un.org, stated:

“It is hard to find a rational justification that explains the ease with which people can buy firearms, including assault rifles, in spite of prior criminal backgrounds, drug use, histories of domestic violence and mental illness, or direct contact with extremists – both domestic and foreign.

How many more mass killings of school-children, of co-workers, of African-American churchgoers — how many more individual shootings of talented musicians like Christina Grimmie, or politicians like Gabrielle Giffords, will it take before the United States adopts robust gun regulation? Why should any civilian anywhere be able to acquire an assault rifle or other high-powered weapons designed to kill lots of people?

Irresponsible pro-gun propaganda suggests that firearms make society safer, when all evidence points to the contrary. The ready availability of guns leaves little space between murderous impulses and actions that result in death. The journey between hate-filled beliefs and violent hate crimes is accelerated. Society — in particular its most vulnerable communities and minorities who are already facing widespread prejudice — pay a high price for the failure to stand up to the lobbyists and take the necessary measures to protect people from gun violence.

Examples from many countries clearly show that a legal framework to control the acquisition and use of firearms has led to a dramatic reduction in violent crime.”

Hillary Rodham Clinton, JD, former US Secretary of State, in a June 20, 2015 article, “Hillary Clinton Calls for ‘Common Sense’ Gun Reforms in Wake of Charleston Shooting,” available at huffingtonpost.com, stated:

“We can have common sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable while respecting responsible gun owners… The stakes are too high, the costs are too dear, and I am not and will not be afraid to keep fighting for common sense reforms, and along with you, achieve those on behalf of all who have been lost because of this senseless gun violence in this country.”

Martin O’Malley, JD, former Governor of Maryland, in an email to constituents reprinted in a June 19, 2015 article, “O’Malley: ‘I’m Pissed,’ Calls for Gun Control, NRA Silencing,” available at the Washington Examiner website, stated:

“It’s time we called this what it is: a national crisis…

So now, I’m doubling down, and I need your help. What we did in Maryland should be the first step of what we do as a nation. The NRA is already blaming the victims of yesterday’s shooting for their own deaths, saying they too should have been armed. Let’s put an end to this madness and finally stand up to them. Here are some steps we should be taking:

1. A national assault weapons ban.

2. Stricter background checks.

3. Efforts to reduce straw-buying, like fingerprint requirements.”

June 19, 2015 - Martin O’Malley, JD

Pro 8

The American Academy of Pediatrics, in a Jan. 2013 statement, “American Academy of Pediatrics Gun Violence Policy Recommendations,” available at aap.org, stated:

“[T]he absence of guns from children’s homes and communities is the most reliable and effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries in children and adolescents.

The AAP continues to support a number of specific measures to reduce the destructive effects of guns in the lives of children and adolescents through the implementation of the following recommendations:

Enact a strong, effective assault weapon ban;

Eliminate the gun show loophole and require mandatory background checks and waiting periods before all firearm purchases;

Ban on high capacity magazines;

Enact strong handgun regulations; and

Require safe firearm storage under federal law.”

Pro 9

The Brady Campaign, on its “Changing Laws” page (accessed Mar. 26, 2015), available at bradycampaign.org, stated:

“The Brady Campaign supports a policy platform that addresses the problem of gun violence and is driven by the opportunity to save the most lives. Every death is a tragedy, whether in a mass shooting that horrifies our entire nation, or one of the 32 gun murders or 90 gun deaths in our communities and homes every day… Policies such as ‘universal background checks’ on all gun sales would keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and other illegal purchasers without impacting anyone else’s Second Amendment right to own guns. Background checks are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans, including gun owners, and they make us all safer.”
