Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should net neutrality restore
Text: Net Neutrality Legislation in States

Heather Morton 1/23/2019

After the Federal Communications Commission Restoring Internet Freedom Order and transparency rule amendments became effective June 11, 2018, overturning earlier requirements on net neutrality requirements on internet service providers, state legislators responded by introducing net neutrality legislation at the state level.

Net neutrality is the concept that all data traffic on a network should be treated indiscriminately, where internet service providers (ISPs) would be restricted from blocking, slowing down or speeding up the delivery of online content at their discretion. The current debate surrounding net neutrality is principally about how ISPs should be regulated and what role government should play in overseeing their network management practices.

The rule change places primary jurisdiction over internet service providers’ network management practices under the Federal Trade Commission and preempts states from enacting similar ISP network restrictions as found in the 2015 Open Internet Order.

Attorneys general from 22 states filed a protective petition for review against the FCC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia introduced 120 bills and resolutions regarding net neutrality in the 2018 legislative session. Five states—California, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont and Washington—enacted legislation or adopted resolutions. California enacted the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018. This act prohibits fixed and mobile internet service providers, as defined, that provide broadband internet access service, as defined, from engaging in specified actions concerning the treatment of internet traffic. In a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, California agreed to not enforce its net neutrality law until the lawsuit challenging the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of the federal regulations is resolved. In addition, California adopted a resolution urging the FCC to reinstate the 2015 Open Internet Order and urging the U.S. Congress to intervene to protect net neutrality and codify its principles in statute.

New Jersey adopted a resolution urging the President and Congress of United States to restore “net neutrality” in federal law. Oregon prohibited public bodies from contracting with broadband Internet access service providers that engage in certain network management activities based on paid prioritization, content blocking or other discrimination.

Vermont required an internet service provider to certify that it is in compliance with consumer protection and net neutrality standards in order to be eligible to receive a government contract for internet service beginning April 15, 2019 or the date on which the governor’s Executive Order No. 2-18 (internet neutrality in state procurement) is revoked and rescinded, whichever is earlier. The act also required the attorney general to review the network management practices of ISPs in Vermont and determine whether they are in compliance with the 2015 FCC net neutrality rules and to disclose those findings on a publicly available website.

Washington required a person providing broadband internet access service in the state to publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of its services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of the services and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings. Further, the law prohibits a person engaged in the provision of broadband internet access service in the state from: (1) Blocking lawful content, applications, services, or nonharmful devices; (2) Impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of internet content, application, or service, or use of a nonharmful device; or (3) Engaging in paid prioritization.

Separately, legislators have introduced measures that would restrict ISPs’ use of customer information and adopt privacy protections. For example, two states, Nevada and Minnesota prohibit disclosure of personally identifying information, but Minnesota also requires ISPs to get permission from subscribers before disclosing information about the subscribers' online surfing habits and internet sites visited.
