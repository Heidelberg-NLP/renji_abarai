con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Text: Why Prostitution Should Be Legal - Decriminalizing Sex Work Will Make Women Safer
Opinion

Why Prostitution Should Be Legal

"Sex workers are, for the most part, just ordinary women who are doing a job."

“But what if it was your daughter? Surely you wouldn’t want to see your child do sex work.”

Thus goes the common refrain whenever the topic of decriminalizing sex work arises.

Writer Damon Linker argued in The Week:

Ask yourself how you would feel if Weeks — porn star Belle Knox — was your daughter. I submit that virtually every honest person — those with children of their own, as well as those who merely possess a functional moral imagination — will admit to being appalled at the thought.

I tried this experiment and discovered that I do not like to imagine my family members having sex of any kind, paid or unpaid.

However, I do not have a daughter. But, then, as Elizabeth Nolan Brown points out, the people making this argument do not necessarily have daughters, either. So, here is a brief list of professions I would not want my fictitious daughter to enter into:

Professionally playing any sport that involves head trauma. (It’s unlikely the NFL is going to let women start playing, but, if they do, I don’t want her getting CTE.)

Being a war reporter. (Everyone I’ve met who has done war reporting has “hilarious” stories about the times they almost died, which I’d find much less hilarious if they were coming from my child.)

Any profession that promises people a quick, easy and most likely ineffective way to solve their problems, like hawking untested diet pills. (It’s deeply immoral to prey on vulnerable people’s hopes.)

Becoming a spokesperson for the alt-right. (The Devil has enough advocates.)

You can agree or disagree with me that I’m right to not want a daughter to enter into those professions. The fact remains that, regardless of how I feel about them, my future daughter has a perfect legal right to pursue them.

People are allowed to enter professions that might be unsafe. People are allowed to enter into professions where their body is seen as a tool of the trade. People are allowed to enter professions that seem morally questionable. The only time that isn’t the case is when a woman is having sex as her profession.

"People are allowed to enter professions that seem morally questionable. The only time that isn’t the case is when a woman is having sex as her profession."

At least, it isn’t the case in the United States. There are a great many countries where sex work is legal, such as New Zealand, which decriminalized sex work in 2003. The results of the Prostitution Reform Act have been beneficial for sex workers. A study from the Christchurch School of Medicine found that “90 percent of sex workers believed the PRA gave them employment, legal and health and safety rights. A substantial 64 percent found it easier to refuse clients. Significantly, 57 percent said police attitudes to sex workers changed for the better.” Prostitutes also reported being able to go to the police when they were hurt or threatened, and one sex worker successfully sued a brothel owner for sexual harassment.

Lives for sex workers in countries like New Zealand are getting better.

Meanwhile, in the United States, we’re cracking down on tools sex workers use such as backpage.com. The website, which allowed escorts to list their services, was shut down earlier this month, and the co-founders and others associated with the company were charged with facilitating prostitution. Attorney General Jeff Sessions described the website as the “dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults alike." (One co-founder has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate prostitution; the other co-founders have pleaded not guilty.) The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) legislation promises to further reduce legal protections for these sites, which means that more of them will likely shut down in the future.

Trafficking, in which women and children are forced into sex work (or other occupations), is morally heinous. Not because it’s sex work. Because it’s forced.

However, criminalizing prostitution—or sites that facilitate sex work transactions—thereby pushing it further underground, isn’t necessarily thought to be helpful when it comes to ending trafficking.

The ACLU explains that people being trafficked “are vulnerable because they often work in jobs that are hidden from the public view and unregulated by the government.”

Critics of decriminalizing prostitution often point to increased reports of trafficking in countries that have legalized prostitution, such as Germany. It is, however, quite possible that’s because people finally started seeing trafficking and began reporting it in greater numbers. Beyond that, a Harvard Study on the topic noted that, “The likely negative consequences of legalized prostitution on a country’s inflows of human trafficking might be seen to support those who argue in favor of banning prostitution, thereby reducing the flows of trafficking…However, such a line of argumentation overlooks potential benefits that the legalization of prostitution might have on those employed in the industry.”

Countries like New Zealand, which have decriminalized all acts of prostitution, seem to have better luck in terms of the wellbeing of sex workers, perhaps because their focus was on creating legislation that “safeguards the human rights of sex workers and protects them from exploitation.”

Reforms in countries like New Zealand seem to show no increase in trafficking, and research suggests that “decriminalization has had little impact on the sex worker population at all, apart to provide it with protection.”

Amnesty International has likewise pushed for decriminalization of prostitution, claiming that, in addition to pushing for policies that protect sex workers from harm and coercion, “Sex workers must also have a say in developing laws that affect their lives and safety. But without decriminalization, they cannot expect equal treatment under the law to achieve these ends.”

Until sex workers are heard and respected, nothing is going to change.

"Until sex workers are heard and respected, nothing is going to change."

Which is an important reminder that you don’t have to look to Amnesty International to figure out how to feel about the shutdown of, for instance, backpage.com. You can look directly to the sex workers it affects.

One sex worker told Newsweek that as a result of the shutdown she was, “devastated and terrified” and that “people are going to die” as prostitution will be forced further underground and prostitutes will have to work with more dangerous people.

Others have described how Backpage helped them, writing, “Backpage gave me a basic screening tool, and access to money, and food, and shelter. Backpage kept me alive.”

We should be listening to them, and involving them in reform, because they’re the people this will impact.

If there is something to be afraid of regarding people entering sex work—beyond the fact that it is a very dangerous profession—is that it tends to render women voiceless. Society will too easily dismiss what they have to say because many people have been told that they do not need to listen to sex workers, or regard them with anything other than disgust or pity.

"Sex work tends to render women voiceless"

ABC recently shared a video wherein Stormy Daniels, a sex worker, said that Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen, “has never thought that the little man or, more especially, women, women like me, mattered. That ends now.”

But it doesn’t. One of the first comments on that video, which was liked 8,000 times, declares, "you got paid for sex...hello your [sic] not like other women."

There are a lot of people out there who do not want to accept the reality that, for the most part, sex workers are just ordinary women who are doing a job they may like or dislike to various degrees for ordinary reasons (to pay their rent, or support their kids, or to save up money for future goals.)

"There are a lot of people out there who do not want to accept the reality that, for the most part, sex workers are just ordinary women who are doing a job they may like or dislike"

This isn’t a problem with sex work. That’s a problem that has to do with the extent to which we disown individuals, especially women, who do sex work. Often, in the case of porn, we disown them while simultaneously enjoying the work they produce.

When we decriminalize sex work, sex workers lives get better. It makes it possible for them to go to police when dealing with unruly clients, rather than being reluctant to do so because it’s illegal. It allows them labor rights that mean if they’re employed, they can expect clean healthy workplaces from their employers. In Nevada, at legal brothels, 84 percent of prostitutes remarked that their jobs felt “safe.” That was “largely because the police, employers and co-workers were there to protect them.”

There’s evidence to indicate decriminalization makes non-sex workers environments better, too. When Rhode Island decriminalized sex work for six years from 2003 to 2009, a study by UCLA found there was a dramatic drop in STDs and rape. The study’s authors remarked that, “decriminalization could have potentially large social benefits for the population at large—not just sex market participants.”

We need to realize that, like every other woman, sex workers are already someone’s daughter. They’re also their own person. And we have to start listening to what they have to say.
