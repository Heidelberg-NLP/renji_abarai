Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Text: New Scientific Statement Seeks to Standardize Cardiac Surgery Trials

With unique challenges, RCTs in cardiac surgery need to take into account deliverability to change practice, says Mario Gaudino.

New Scientific Statement Seeks to Standardize Cardiac Surgery Trials

In an effort to bolster the level of evidence produced by randomized clinical trials in cardiac surgery, a new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) outlines specific methodological challenges and offers solutions.

“Randomized trials are the highest level of evidence—they inform practice, but most importantly, they affect patient outcomes,” lead author Mario Gaudino, MD, PhD (Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY), told TCTMD. “However, randomized trials in surgery, and in cardiac surgery in particular, face unique challenges compared to drug trials.”

While pharmaceutical trials compare “pill a versus pill b,” surgical trial outcomes can be affected by the experience and preferences of each individual operator involved—what Gaudino termed the “surgeon effect.”

“We’ve seen in the past examples of important large trials that, in the end, were not able to provide the answer they were supposed to provide because of methodological issues and because of the lack of attention to the details such as . . . deliverability,” Gaudino said, although he declined to provide examples.

To prevent this from happening in the future, this statement, sponsored by the AHA and published this week in Circulation, provides guidance around standardizing processes so that trial outcomes can not only reliably change practice but can also be pooled with those from other trials in larger meta-analyses. Of note, the document was generated by the AHA’s surgical council and did not involve the major surgical societies. Joint documents, said Gaudino, are “very complicated” and take more time to pull together.

Timing of conducting surgical trials is also critically important, according to Gaudino. “It's complicated because surgical technique tends to evolve with time; it is initially described then subsequently modified to make them better and better,” he said. “So if you do your trial too early after the introduction of the procedure, the procedure may not be mature [enough] to be tested. But then if you wait too much, you take the risk that the community adopts the procedure even in absence of solid data to a point that then there is no equipoise of a trial comparing it to the old standard of care because nobody is using the old standard of care anymore.”

The document also addresses quality-of-life and patient-reported outcomes “that are kind of neglected in surgical trials, but I think they are very important,” Gaudino said.

Gaudino said he expects this statement, the first of its kind, to be updated as approaches to clinical trials continue to change. “The pandemic has really accelerated the use of new trial design, looking at platform trials [for example],” he said. “So, it is possible that in the future, in a few years, there will be more to be said.”

Going forward, Gaudino said he would like to not only see cardiac surgeons performing more RCTs but also see them using this document as a “guidebook” to make future trials even better.
