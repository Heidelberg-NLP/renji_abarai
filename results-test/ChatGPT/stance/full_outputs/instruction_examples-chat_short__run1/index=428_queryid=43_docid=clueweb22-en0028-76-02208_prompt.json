Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should bottle water ban

Opinion: HISD should install water bottle stations with lead filters

FILE- In this Sept. 4, 2018 file photo, a student gets water from a cooler in the hallway at Gardner Elementary School in Detroit. Some 50,000 Detroit public school students will started the school year by drinking water from coolers, not fountains, after the discovery of elevated levels of lead or copper. New Jersey's biggest city has recently been the epicenter of a problem with lead in drinking water, but the United States has an estimated 6 million lead pipes, many of them in unknown locations.

Clean water justice

Regarding “Editorial: Just how bad is the lead problem in Houston’s water?”, (Oct. 21): Across literature, water is often used to symbolize purity, clarity and refreshment. Unfortunately, this is not the reality of water that we live in. Many cities in the United States are plagued by poor water quality, making it difficult for some families to ensure that what they are drinking is safe and clean. One factor that can lead to water contamination is lead, which can be found in old pipes and water systems. A potent neurotoxin, lead affects how our children learn, grow and behave. According to the EPA, “In children, low levels of [lead] exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells.” Lead is so toxic that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a health standard of 1 part per billion. It’s clear that the dangers of lead far outweigh any cost it would take to make sure kids have access to safe and clean drinking water. That’s why I’m calling on Houston ISD to protect its students from lead exposure by implementing water bottle filling stations with point-of-use lead filters to ensure that students can experience a healthy lifestyle.
