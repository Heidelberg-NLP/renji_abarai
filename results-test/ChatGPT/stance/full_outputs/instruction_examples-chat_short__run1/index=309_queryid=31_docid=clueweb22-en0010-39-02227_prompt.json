<USER>
Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Text: New criteria for 'obesity disease' in Japan

New criteria for 'obesity disease' in Japan

Circ J. 2002 Nov;66(11):987-92. doi: 10.1253/circj.66.987.

Abstract

The present study was designed to establish adequate criteria for categorizing 'obesity disease' in Japan in relation to obesity-related complications. The subjects were 1,193 Japanese subjects (775 men, 418 women; age: 20-84 years old, body mass index (BMI): 14.9-56.4 kg/m(2)) including subjects undergoing a health examination and obese subjects visiting an obesity clinic. Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were determined by computed tomography (CT) at the umbilical level. Anthropometric parameters, including BMI, waist circumference (W), waist/hip circumference (W/H), ratio and waist circumference/body height (W/BH) ratio, were measured. Hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension were evaluated as obesity-related complications. The relationship between each parameter and the prevalence of the complications was investigated. The number of complications increased in accordance with BMI and the average value was greater than 1.0 at a BMI of 25. The best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for detecting subjects with multiple risk factors was a BMI of 25. BMI showed a close positive correlation with SFA (r=0.82), even for BMI > or =25 (r=0.77), but had a weaker correlation with VFA (r=0.54). The obese subjects with a BMI > or =25 had no correlation between BMI and VFA because of the wide individual variation of VFA. The number of disorders was greater than 1.0 at 100 cm(2) of VFA and the best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for determining subjects with multiple risk factors was 100 cm(2) of VFA. Between the simple anthropometric values and measurement of VFA, it was proven that W had the closest relationship with VFA in both men (r=0.68) and women (r=0.65). The regression line obtained from simple correlation analyses indicated that the W corresponding to 100 cm(2) of VFA was 84.4 cm in men and 92.5 cm in women. These data suggest that obesity is adequately specified as a BMI > or =25 in Japan where the prevalence and degree of obesity remains mild. It is reasonable to establish the cut-off point of VFA at 100 cm(2) as indicative of the risk of obesity-related disorders and a waist circumference of 85 cm in men and 90 cm in women approximates to this visceral fat mass.
