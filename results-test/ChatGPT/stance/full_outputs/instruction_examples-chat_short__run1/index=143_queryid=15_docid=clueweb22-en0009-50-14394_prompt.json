Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Animals Be Used For Scientific Experiments?

Best Essays
A dog is a man’s best friend, is a commonly used phrase to describe an intimate relationship between human and dog that has developed over the centuries. But is this popular phrase true? Are dogs truly a mans best friend? Some argue of course they are— they are friendly, loyal, and in most cases considered a part of the family. But there are those who will disagree—people from other parts of the world, and at different times in history. Take scientists from the nineteenth century, for example, where a man’s best friend was used in scientific experiments that led to the discovery of insulin for diabetes, and saved millions of lives (MacGill: par. 1, 2016). So, where do we draw the line from justifying the use of animals for scientific…show more content…
Lastly, I will conclude by highlighting the main ideas, and will finish off with my own reflections regarding the debate.
Source Methodology This section will describe sources, both academic (scholarly journals and peer review), and popular (articles, blogs) that has been used. All sources were equally important and essential to the formulation of all findings presented in this research paper.
Academic Sources All sources listed in this section are all peer reviewed or are written by academic scholars, that speak to the debate on animals and scientific experiments. For my scholarly sources I examined the following publications: Firstly I used Laura Cox and V. Tamara Montrose’s empirical research, “How Do Human-Animal Emotional Relationship Influence Public Perceptions of Animal Use?” Journal of Animal Ethics. 2016. DOI:10.5406. Both authors have acquired PhD’s and a bachelor’s degree in animal sciences. According to the publisher, this particular journal is dedicated to research regarding animal ethics, and issues in the field of animal sciences, and therefore is useful to this research topic. Another academic research based journal I reviewed was, Cattaneo C. et al.,“Animal Experimentation in Forensic Science: How Far Have We Come?” Forensic Science International. 2015. DOI: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.06.024. The authors
