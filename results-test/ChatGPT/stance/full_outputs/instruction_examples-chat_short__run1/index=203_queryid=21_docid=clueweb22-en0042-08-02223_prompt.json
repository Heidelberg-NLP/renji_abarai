Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Essay on Human Activity in Climate Change

Decent Essays
This essay and its contents is designed to define and discuss the concept of my position on the following statement: “Human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels. It also answers inquiries of; is it a major contributor to climate change? Do I agree or disagree?

From my research and readings, I‘ve concluded that, the foremost effect that burning fossil fuels has on our environment is the greenhouse effect, also known as global warming. Carbon dioxide, which is also known as greenhouse gas is released during combustion of fossil fuels and is the cause of this catastrophe. But yet, other problems arise amongst the burning of fossil fuels, for example the depletion of fossil fuels, the shift of climate control, and the

Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather. (http://www.epa.gov/climatechange 2012)
The uprising global temperatures have been supplemented by changes in weather and climate. Throughout the world, many places have seen different changes in rainfall; this crisis resulted in more floods, famines, and extreme rain, as well as additional frequent and severe heat waves. As these changes are introduced to us the coming future, they will more than likely present challenges to our society and our environment.

Changes of the land
Greenhouse gases act as a blanket surrounding Earth, trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm and stay warm. As we see the heating of the earth we also see the loss of ice and snow. The ice and snow cools the earth as well as reflect heat. Absorbing heat means more ice melting, which means more heat is absorbed and more ice is melted, the process is a revolving circle. Land-use change, such as deforestation, is a big contributor because trees are essentially ‘wet sticks of carbon’, and so burning them both releases CO2 and prevents the trees from absorbing CO2 through photosynthesis, their method of turning sunlight, nutrients and water into energy to grow.

Making the difference
One of the solutions I’ve researched in solving the greenhouse effect is to increase the earth’s ability to absorb and store carbon. This
