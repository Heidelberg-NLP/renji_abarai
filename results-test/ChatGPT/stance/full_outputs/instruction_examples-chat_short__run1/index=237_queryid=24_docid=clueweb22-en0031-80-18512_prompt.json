pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: lower federal corporate income tax rate create job
Text: National Sales Tax Vs. Federal Income Tax

by Stan Mack

Business owners pay significant amounts of money in income taxes, as individuals and sometimes also as a corporation. The federal government depends heavily on the revenue it obtains from income taxes, but processing millions of income tax returns is a costly enterprise. Some people propose replacing the current system of federal income taxes with a national sales tax.

National Sales Tax

A national sales tax would be a consumption tax, meaning that people would pay it every time they make a purchase. Retail stores, for example, might add a 30-percent charge to every purchase and then forward what they collect to the federal government. The major advantage of the national sales tax is decreased tax collection costs. The federal government must handle collecting and processing many income returns under the current system, as well as prosecute tax dodgers, all of which adds up to billions of dollars in administrative costs, according to the book “Economics for Today,” by Irvin B. Tucker.

Loopholes

A national sales tax would apply to all purchases, so theoretically the national sales tax could bring in more revenue. For example, under the current federal income tax system, savvy millionaires can use loopholes to lower their taxable income. But a national sales tax wouldn’t have such loopholes. Those millionaires would pay their share of taxes every time they made purchase. However, that creates a potential problem for small and large businesses alike: they would now be responsible for collecting federal taxes during each purchase, which is an administrative burden they wouldn't get paid for.

Impact

Poor people pay disproportionately more for basic living expenses than rich people do. For example, paying for bread makes up a larger percentage of a poor family’s budget than it does a wealthy family’s. That means a national sales tax would disproportionately impact poor people. The same holds true for the owners of small businesses -- their overhead for basic business expenses, such as office supplies or raw materials, makes up a greater percentage of their companies' spending than it does for large businesses. In other words, a national sales tax could put smaller businesses at a relative disadvantage to larger competitors. In comparison, the current federal income tax system assigns different tax rates based on income level. Low-income people pay a lower percentage than wealthy people, which helps equalize the tax’s impact across different income levels.

Tax Evasion

Another possible disadvantage of a national sales tax is that unscrupulous people might start selling products in black markets, and the lower prices would undermine honest sellers, such as retail stores. On the other hand, tax evasion is also a problem under the current federal income tax system. People can work off-the-books, for example, and not report the income to the federal government.

Facts About Nationwide Sales Tax

Some tax-reform advocates have historically moved to institute a nationwide sales tax in place of the federal income tax system. Major tax policy proposals are always controversial, but one thing is clear: Any drastic change in tax policies could have enormous effects on businesses, no matter how big or small.

Current Tax System

The nationwide sales tax is a policy change typically proposed by tax-reform advocates who are dissatisfied with the current federal tax system, which most notably levies a progressive income tax, as of publication. That means low-income earners pay a lower tax rate than high-income earners.

Problems with the Current System

Nationwide sales tax advocates claim their proposal will fix problems with the current federal income tax program. For example, loopholes in the federal income tax code allow some people to dodge taxes. A nationwide sales tax, advocates claim, would not have those loopholes because it is a consumption tax, not a tax on income. A consumption tax means that people pay their taxes as part of a purchase. For example, a nationwide sales tax could levy a 30-percent tax on all purchases.

Potential Advantages

The major potential advantage of a nationwide sales tax is that people would no longer pay income tax by filing returns. That means the current loopholes would no longer exist, the federal government would no longer need to process tax returns or prosecute tax evaders, and citizens would no longer have to hire tax professionals. The savings could be significant. For example, cutting or eliminating the Internal Revenue Service conceivably could save billions of dollars, according to the book “Survey of Economics,” by Irvin B. Tucker. Another potential advantage is that more people might end up paying taxes because everyone makes purchases, but not everyone files a tax return.

Potential Disadvantages

Critics of a nationwide sales tax say the plan has many potential disadvantages. First, people might start hiding their purchases to avoid a steep sales tax. Black markets for products and services would develop, hurting honest businesses. Also, poor people spend a larger percentage of their income on food, housing and other necessities, so a sales tax might hurt them disproportionately. Finally, retail businesses would be required to collect the sales tax and send it to the federal government, which might put an unfair burden on business owners.

Considerations

Tax policy is incredibly complex, requiring an in-depth understanding of how an economy and its individual markets can react to fundamental changes. If you’re not sure how tax reform could affect your business, ask an experienced accountant or tax adviser for guidance. Also, research the positions of experts on both sides of the debate so you can make informed choices and protect your business.
