Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should death penalty allow
Text: Should The Death Penalty Be Legal?
Start writing a post

 

The death penalty should still occur in some cases to eradicate the individuals who continuously become a menace to society. However, they should be first convicted of this crime and have multiple evidence supporting this conviction in order to be placed on death role.

In the 18th Century B.C., the death penalty first established by King Hammurabi of Babylon and was written in the code of Hammurabi, a legal document from ancient Babylon. Within this document, there are 25 punishable laws by death such as adultery and treason. By the 10th century A.D., the death penalty was introduced to Britain. However, in the following century William the Conquer did not participate in any type of executing useless in times of war. However, Henry VIII had something different on his agenda. He gave someone a death penalty by boiling and beheading them if they did simple things such as marry a Jew or withholding information. Like all former and colonies of Britain, they adapted their judicatory system, the U.S. included.

The death penalty in Modern times is not rampant like how it was centuries ago; however, it is essential in today’s cruel society. Each year crime rates increase exponentially with criminal activities crueler than in previous years. Once someone gets convicted of a serious crime, especially if they commit multiple offenses, I believe they should be put to death simply because they are not contributing to society in a positive way. Nevertheless, Criminals should only be put to death if they committed a serious crime like serial killing and if convicted of the crime.

Yes, life is important and murder is one of the Ten Commandments, yet if someone who is seen as an enemy of mankind threatening lives and becoming a plague to society taking away someone’s joy or the life I believe they should be relieved of their duty immediately. With this, they can no longer harm anyone and they would serve as an example to those who continue to be Society’s Cancer. This “example” would; therefore, scare individuals who haven’t been caught making the crime rate decrease significantly. In countries such as Jamaica, the tax is used to aid in the upkeep of the prison and the prisoners. Persons convicted of petty crimes should serve their sentence as well as perform community service to pay for their own food instead of taking taxpayers money to do so. It is unfair for taxpayers to pay for these criminals to be fed while dependents could use the money for better use.

On the contrary, there are some cases that people do learn from their mistakes. I commend the few prisons worldwide that actually have an educational system in prison which helps them get their GEDs, degrees or a skill which will help them and the society when they are released. However, it makes no sense for a who committed treason, serial killer or rapist to be let back on the streets to commit the same crime over and over again. They should be handed the death penalty so that persons who are thinking or do the same act will develop some kind of fear.

With this, prisoners should be executed if the commit a serious crime if proven guilty to serve as an example for those who continue towards that path. Petty criminals need to work hard manual labor to pay for the expenses in jail, such as food that comes out their taxes. This would allow the taxpayers not to feel the burden and allow them not to pay for their sins.

Tumblr

Well folks, the tundra is turning into the tropics. Store away the snow boots and say peace out to the parkas, because it is time for these 10 critical winter-to-spring transitions:

1. Scary Hairy to Soft n' Smooth

Bears, it's post-hibernation time.

2. Pumpkin Spice Lattes to Iced Caramel Frappes

Cold caffeine will be consumed in the environment it deserves.

3. Layered Covered Limbs to Exposed Epidermis

Time to get as tan as pawsibble.

4. Beans to Keens

Time to let the toes breathe in style.

5. Frackets to Non-Jackets

Not below freezing you say? Guess that fracket is going away.


6. Soups to Salads

I accept the last-minute-bikini-bod prep

7. Beanie Caps to Bucket Hats

Shade the spring sun with the oddest head gear possible.

8. Colds&Coughs to Cut Offs

#FreeTheUpperThighsSpring2k16

9. North Face to South By Sea

Break out those rain coats and srat pastel tanks~

10. Timbs to...

Who am I kidding, those shoes are staying on all four seasons and the apocalypse.

Although you'll probably curse us with a snow storm a week before May, goodbye Winter.

***

It's out with the old and in with what's socially Spring acceptable.

Goodbye snow clouds of gray, hello skies of blue and rain clouds.

A pre-mature dip in the pool, a trip to the spa.

A few days in my shades.

The whole part of this hemisphere according to the Spring season.

5 Books to Read This Spring

Spring is in full bloom and what better way to spend it reading cool books?

5 Books to Read This Spring

Thanks to my Kindle, I've gotten back into the realm of reading, and it's been great so far. I've always been a reader, and although you may rather spend your time basking in the spring sun, here are five books to curl up with just before bed.

*in no particular order

1) Doghead by Morten Ramsland

Doghead tells the story of a dysfunctional Norwegian family throughout several generations. The book is hilarious and its characters are funky. Although a medium-length this books flies by.

2) The Enchanted by Rene Denfeld

I'll admit: this book was kind of very depressing. It takes place in an "enchanted place" of a prison set in presumably modern-day society. The story weaves multiple POV's but in a way that is smooth, and you sympathize for each character. Even if it's magical realism, you also question the criminal justice system.

3) Wool by Hugh Howey

Perhaps my favorite modern sci-fi book of all time, Wool takes place in a futuristic society where people live in underground silos. No one has been outside for decades, except for those who clean the cameras stationed outside. The book is suspensful, full of action and thrills that will want you to read it again.

4) An Anatomy of Small Bombs by Karan Mahajan

Mahajan's second book focuses on multiple characters as they struggle through the repercussions of a terrorist attack in India. The book is haunting and acts as part of an allegory to today's political climate.

5) Catalog of Unabashed Attitude by Ross Gay

I'm not one for poetry, but Gay is able to keep my attention throughout Catalog. His poems range from a variety of topics as well as styles, and it's really refreshing to be able to see how funky you can get with poetry and still understand every single word. The diction is beautiful as well as Gay himself (yes, I got to hear him speak!).

Best Summer Songs For The Best Summer Vibes

I love all types of music, and of course, I listen to the most popular stuff and really like it. Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Galantis, Trippie Redd, Khalid, and a bunch of different remixes are some of my favorites. That being said, something about summer time makes me want to listen to songs that make me feel the happiest - and I have a unique playlist of songs that capture these exact feelings. Super carefree, laid back, and well summery. Well, they aren't completely unique, but they are songs I only find myself listening to as the summer months come closer. Next time you are in the car with a group of your best friends driving home from a day at the beach in the sunset... maybe you will consider these songs to add to your next playlist!
