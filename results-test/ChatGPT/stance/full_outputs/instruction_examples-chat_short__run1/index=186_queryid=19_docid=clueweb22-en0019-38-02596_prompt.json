Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should gay marriage legal
Text: Gay Marriage is Legal in Colorado

Gay Marriage is Legal in Colorado

Yesterday, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers paved the way for the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This has been a long fought battle for marriage equality; in 2006, Colorado passed Amendment 43 which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. In 2010, the 10 th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Utah's ban on gay marriage, and many County Clerks began issuing same-sex marriage licenses in Colorado. Mr. Suthers sued the County Clerks who issued the licenses in a response to the stay on the 10 th Circuits ruling as an appeal was pending.

Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States turned away appeals from five states which were requesting to prohibit same-sex marriage. In essence, this ended the stays on issuing same-sex marriage licenses for those states that were awaiting appeal decisions. This led the Colorado Attorney General to issue the following statement, "There are no remaining legal requirements that prevent same-sex couples from legally marrying in Colorado. Beginning today, Colorado's 64 county clerks are legally required to issue licenses to same-sex couples who request them. In addition, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is required to register such marriages in the records of the state of Colorado." County Clerks in Pueblo and Larimer counties began issuing same-sex marriage licenses hours after the Supreme Court denied review. In support of this move, Mr. Suthers has stated that he will no longer defend Colorado's Amendment 43.

With the actions by the Supreme Court, 30 states and the District of Columbia now have legalized same-sex marriage. Six more states are up for grabs as the 6 th and 9 th Circuit Courts have the same issue on their dockets. However, there are many other states that ban same-sex marriage and the refusal by the Supreme Court to hear the issue means that same-sex marriages still have an indefinite future.

The issues of marriage and divorce are complicated - ones that have significant impacts on a person's life, family, and well-being. If you are experiencing legal difficulties with your family life, you should contact a knowledgeable and experienced attorney who can guide you through those difficult times.
