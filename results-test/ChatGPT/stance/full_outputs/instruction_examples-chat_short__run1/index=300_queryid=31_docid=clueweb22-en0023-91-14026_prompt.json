Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: obesity disease
Text: Obesity & Heart Disease

Overview

Obesity is a common problem in the United States. Current research suggests that one in three Americans is obese. Obesity and overweight are linked to several factors that increase ones risk for cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease and stroke):

  • High blood lipids, especially high triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol
  • High blood pressure
  • Impaired glucose tolerance or type-2 (also called adult onset) diabetes
  • Metabolic syndrome

Obesity and overweight are also linked to hypertension and an enlarged left ventricle (left ventricular hypertrophy), increasing risk for heart failure.

In addition, overweight and obesity can be related to some cancers, gallbladder disease and osteoarthritis.

Are you at increased risk?

To determine if your weight is linked to increase risk of heart disease, two measurements are used:

  • Body Mass Index (BMI)
  • Waist Circumference

Body Mass Index (BMI)

The BMI is a mathematical formula that factors a person’s height and weight in determining obesity. It may be less accurate for athletes or older persons who have lost muscle mass.

  • Underweight - Below 18.5
  • Normal - 18.5 - 24.9
  • Overweight - 25.0 - 29.9
  • Obesity 30.0 - and Above

Those who are overweight or obese and have two or more risk factors should lose weight to decrease their risk for heart disease. Use the body mass indicator below to calculate your BMI.

Waist circumference

Your waist circumference is the measurement of your waist, just above your navel. It is a good predictor of abdominal fat, a risk factor for heart disease. This risk increases with a waist measurement of over 40 inches in men and over 35 inches in women
