Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Last October, Fox Sports announced that one of the network’s marquee hires, former Golf Channel Morning Drive host Holly Sonders, would no longer be a part of its golf broadcasts.

In the nearly five months since the announcement, Sonders has been contributing to the network’s NFL coverage and recently announced an upcoming project with the NFL Network.

Sonders also co-hosts 18 Holes, a golf destination show, alongside Natalie Gulbis and Jimmy Hanlin.

In an interview with Golfweek, Sonders reflected on the turn her career has taken.

“The golf at Fox just didn’t turn out to be what we thought it would be,” she said. “We hoped we would get more PGA Tour rights, and it just didn’t end up happening. But I wanted to be in the studio and show my personality. It’s what I like to do, make people smile and think and bring the best out of my co-host. There’s nothing like walking out of a studio knowing you kicked ass. And then there are a million projects that are on the table that are more entertainment and fun, so I’m kind of in that world too, and that’s been really good.”

Sonders was the face of Fox golf when the network took the helm for the USGA’s championship boradcasts in 2015. She suffered an embarrassing on-air gaffe when, in the aftermath of his dramatic victory, she asked Jordan Spieth whether he had packed an additional outfit for a potential Monday playoff.

While Fox took a lot of criticism following its U.S. Open broadcast debut, the network has been open about the areas that could be improved upon (high-profile hire Greg Norman was dismissed after just one year on the job) and its commitment to learning from past mistakes to be better each year.

Sonders, though, isn’t ruling out a return to golf.

“We never say never,” she told Golfweek. “Golf is still a part of who I am and what got me here.”
