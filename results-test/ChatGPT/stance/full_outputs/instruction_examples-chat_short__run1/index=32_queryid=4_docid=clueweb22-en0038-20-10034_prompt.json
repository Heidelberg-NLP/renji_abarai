Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

A switch, a paddle, a belt, an open hand. To some parents, these may be methods of teaching. But to a child, these could be symbols of fear. Corporal punishment is discipline intended to cause pain, commonly towards a child. Some parents believe that it can be used ethically, as a last resort, or ‘coming from a place of love’. But others, such as the American Psychological Association (APA), strongly oppose the use of corporal punishment and recommend other parenting techniques.(1) Over the past few decades, and as more research has been done to show that there are many negative long term effects, many parents no longer use physical punishment. Those that are left are firmly entrenched in the idea that it is safe and effective.

A child may not understand talking out their issues, or other forms of punishment such as a time-out. But a child who is immediate to associate pain with an undesired behavior ideally will not repeat it. The rhetoric of a parent who uses this type of punishment is typically that the mild pain a child may endure will save them from the worse pain that poor behavior may bring. Corporal punishment has been proven to temporarily stop ‘bad’ behavior, but at what cost to the child, and their relationships with others, especially their…show more content…
I have seen the damage it can cause, and I have never seen an instance where it was used humanely and effectively. Though some may claim there is a line between abuse and corporal punishment, they are effectively the same. Both cause mental health issues, both can cause further violence, and neither should be seen as acceptable to direct to a child. It is my firm belief that a child should never have to be physically afraid of or traumatized by their parent as a result of corporal punishment. In conclusion, adults ought to consider the effects of corporal punishment before they employ its
