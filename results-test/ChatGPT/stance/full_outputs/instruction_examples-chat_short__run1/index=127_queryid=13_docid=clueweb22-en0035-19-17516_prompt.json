con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: can alternative energy effectively replace fossil fuel
Text: Can hydropower replace fossil fuels? - Quora

No. There are only so many hydropower sites available and they’ve all pretty much been tapped out.

As far as using pumped hydro as an energy storage means for energy, while hydro is valuable for this it doesn’t have the capability to match the storage capability of using chemical fuels.

There is however still lots of untapped hydro resources out there that have yet to be utilized for power. But these resources are very location dependent and many of these locations are inconvenient to utilize or do not have the topography to build a facility with high energy density.

There are three very important factors when evaluating a hydro resource. One is the flow volume (m3/s) and stability of the wat

As far as using pumped hydro as an energy storage means for energy, while hydro is valuable for this it doesn’t have the capability to match the storage capability of using chemical fuels.

There is however still lots of untapped hydro resources out there that have yet to be utilized for power. But these resources are very location dependent and many of these locations are inconvenient to utilize or do not have the topography to build a facility with high energy density.

There are three very important factors when evaluating a hydro resource. One is the flow volume (m3/s) and stability of the water that needs to be processed. The next is the head, or vertical drop that can be acquired. These two together will determine how much energy can be produced, but more head/vertical drop ensures that more energy can be attained for the same amount of water, and thus results in greater energy density for less infrastructure.

There are many hydro systems that could be built with a low-flow system in places where topography is not as advantageous to build a large vertical drop or high flow system. These systems however will have lower energy density and so will not be as cost effective but many could still produce energy competitively. They may also not be able to easily modulate their output without wasting precious water flow as they may be built without a dedicated reservoir.

The last important factor when evaluating a hydro resource is proximity to consumers. Transmission infrastructure is needed to be built and maintained to deliver energy to those who need it, so if you don’t have local consumers to utilize the energy then there will be high costs to deliver it to a market that does.

One technology that could make up for some of the proximity limitations of hydro would be pairing such a facilities to a chemical processing or fuel plant. Building energy consumption industries in proximity of the energy resources will save on electrical infrastructure needs as shipping of their products may be more cost efficient than building out a robust energy distribution system.

So, to fully utilize hydro and use it to offset fossil fuels you will need to utilize and harness as many valid hydro locations as possible. For those with difficulty in transmitting this energy to consumers or with excess capacity, pairing these resources to a fuel plant or other high energy-consumptive industry built in close proximity that can modulate it’s consumption may be the best way to ensure that hydro can offset as much fossil fuel as possible.

Yes, our modern jet liners can run on hydropower, and so can our long distance truck fleet.

We just have to build lots of waterfalls at the airports and on the highways and problem solved!

Since the late 19th century hydropower has been one of the main choices to generate electricity. But further development is limited, because all the rivers on earth are already utilized. Hydropower gradually loses importance compared to other options. In the mid 20th century it contributed 25%, which is now down to 16%.

No. Hydro power can be substituted for fossil fuels where it’s available, but there aren’t very many places left where more hydro plants can be built…….. not even one percent of the quantity needed.

So hydro power is not the answer to the fossil fuel problem. It’s just not available in enough places or in large enough amounts.

In theory it can, but in reality it would be pretty difficult.

Most of the good places to produce hydropower have already been used for that, so you’d have to start building in sub-optimal places. Those sub-optimal places also tend to be heavily populated. So not only are you going to be building inefficient generators, but you’re going to be displacing millions of people to do it.

Here in my country, 72% of all the electricity generated in Hydropower, 23% came from Fossil Fuel and 5% is solar & wind, so, yes, Hydropower can replace most of the fossil fuels but..

Just in electricity generation, not in all cars, neither cargo ships, cruisers or airplanes, neither in steelworks or cement.

It is already replacing some fossil fuels. In regions with good hydropower resources, they are being used instead of coal or natural gas fired power plants.

It is not a universal replacement for fossil fuels, because not everywhere has good hydroelectric resources (e.g. suitable rivers, ability to dam).

No. The amount of water lifted to mountain height and rained down on mountains is far smaller than the amount of sunlight needed to ‘power’ the weather that lift/evaporate it up there. It is still a lot though, and a good way to supplement all the other ways we have to harness some of the power that comes to us from the sun.

No. No chance whatsoever of replacing half of fossil fuels in the next 15 years. Anyone who looks at the numbers and the growth trends sees this immediately.

Speaking in round numbers for the entire planet, coal provides 1/4 of global energy, oil provides 1/4 of global energy, and natural gas provides 1/4 of global energy. All other sources (nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, solar) are single-digit percents.

The EIA (the US's federal energy administration) expects renewables to grow from ~1% of the global energy supply to ~4% by 2035. That's extrapolating out the 2012 exponential growth rate. It's an enormous amount of growth, but the baseline quantity of renewables output is simply too small for even exponential growth to make much of a dent. Renewables will have to increase by about a factor of ~6x to even make it to 4%. It's taken about 20 years to hit 1%, and now we have to do that five or six times over in another 20. That's not trivial.

The simple ground-truth of the global energy supply is that the developing world's demand for energy is growing far faster than renewables can scale up. There are billions of people on Earth who want to live a middle-class lifestyle. That requires dramatically more -- about 50% higher -- global energy consumption in the next ~20 years, even including significant expected gains in energy efficiency.

The growth rate of renewable power is not enough to even remotely meet this increasing energy demand. Consumption of fossil fuels must grow for the developing world to develop. There is simply no other option that can scale fast enough, at low enough cost.

Many estimates now put wind power at a lower cost and solar power at a competitive cost versus fossil fuels, but this ignores externalized grid management costs imposed by non-dispatchable power sources. (Renewables are only profitable right now with government subsidies, and subsidies become absurdly unaffordable when renewables hit large scale deployment.) Additional costs must be borne by utilities that are not being included in the cost analyses for solar and wind. Renewables could technically provide all global power if you ignore the economics, but that isn't really a feasible option outside academic papers. Economics matter when you want a power source to leave the margins and enter large-scale use.

The only non-fossil power source that even comes close to being able to unseat fossil fuels is nuclear power, and that is politically off the table in most countries. Even then, a significant amount of fossil fuel use would be required for petrochemicals, fertilizers, air travel, and fast-acting dispatchable power plants. This unavoidable fossil fuel consumption amounts to 20-30% of global consumption. So eliminating half of fossil fuel use globally would require eliminating the vast majority of all vehicles and power plants currently operating. I'm sorry, but when you understand the scale involved and effort required to replace trillions of dollars in global infrastructure, it's obvious that 15 years is an utterly laughable timeframe to reduce fossil fuel use by any significant amount. Transitioning the energy supply is a multi-generational problem -- it likely will not happen in our lifetimes.
