neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should bottle water ban
Text: The Cape Cod Bottle Ban

Kennedy Ryan | 8/24/2021

On September 1, 2021, single-use plastic water bottles will no longer be sold in 7 of the 15 Barnstable County towns including Brewster, Eastham, Falmouth, Harwich, Orleans, Provincetown, and Wellfleet.

According to Sustainable Practices, a Barnstable County-focused environmental action group, over 1,500 single-use plastic water bottles are used and discarded every second. While it’s better to recycle single-use plastic bottles than throw them in the trash, refusing them altogether has become the top priority.

Back in June of 2021, all 15 Cape Cod towns instituted a Municipal Plastic Bottle Ban, which eliminated the purchase of single-use plastic beverages by town governments and prohibited the sale on town properties. In addition, 10 of these towns have now adopted a Commercial Plastic Bottle Ban, prohibiting the sale of single-use plastic water bottles by in town retailers. Beginning in September of 2021, the water bottles will no longer be sold in Brewster, Eastham, Falmouth, Harwich, Orleans, Provincetown, and Wellfleet with the towns of Chatham, Dennis, and Sandwich soon following suit in later months.

As a result of this, Cape Cod has the most municipalities enacting the ban in the country, becoming the leader in this green initiative nationwide.

To learn more about The Cape Plastic Bottle Ban, please visit Sustainable Practices.

Visitors should pack reusable water bottles for their trip or plan to purchase a reusable bottle at one of the many retailers throughout the Cape.

Not sure where to refill your bottle? Findtap.com is a great tool to find refill stations. Simply enter your vacation zip code, and the website will provide nearby locations.

This initiative will reduce waste and lower Cape Cod’s carbon footprint, making the Cape a national leader for green initiatives.
