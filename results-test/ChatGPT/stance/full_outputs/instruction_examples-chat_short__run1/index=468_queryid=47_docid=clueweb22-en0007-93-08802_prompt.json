Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: homework beneficial
Text: The Great Homework Debate

0

Over the summer, the PTO for my daughter’s school was pushing really hard to eliminate homework from elementary school. There were a lot of views brought up, and it was a really good debate. A new principal was coming in, and we all thought it was apt timing to bring this issue up (again). We first pushed for it about three years ago.

An educator of 15 years that is part of our community was the one who initiated the conversation. Her perspective, from that of a teacher (of at-risk and accelerated students) and from that of a parent, homework does not improve learning at the grade school level.

homework

Most of the comments included tales of their children crying most nights and the nightmare that homework can be for many households (mine included!). Some teachers commented that they had made their own decision not to require homework and focused instead on classroom learning. One parent was all for the “no homework movement,” but thought it would be good for her sixth-grader to have it just as preparation for middle school.

Another common thread was that having a reading log and spelling words to work on from home were beneficial.

My husband does much better with our fourth-grader at homework time (he has much more patience than I do), but somehow I always end up having my daughter in tears after the first few minutes of helping her with homework. Besides, this “new math” gives me “new” anxieties! I do understand how different methods are beneficial to how different kids’ brains work uniquely, but this is another whole topic for another time…

Here are some recaps from both sides in our grade school community:

Pros to “No Homework”
  • Less tears in the evening
  • More fun, family time
  • Less grading for teachers
  • Less frustration for parents
  • Kids get to be kids more
  • Decreased pressure on young kids
Cons to “No Homework”
  • Possibly unprepared for middle/high school
  • Less parent engagement in school work
  • Less cultivation of study habits
  • Chance of less-rounded education overall
  • Indeterminate research on the issue

How many of you have seen research on this great homework debate, and what are your thoughts? Does your child’s school have a no homework policy? If so, how has this affected your child’s learning and testing scores?
