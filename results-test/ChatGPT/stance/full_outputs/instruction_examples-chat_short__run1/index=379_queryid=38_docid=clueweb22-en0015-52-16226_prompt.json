Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

West Virginia Medical Marijuana Laws Patients Should Know

There are several important West Virginia medical marijuana laws every patient must know. With the signing of Senate Bill SB 386, West Virginia became the 29th state to legalize medical cannabis. While this is a huge victory for advocates, it comes with some strict regulations that must be followed. Non-compliance with these medical marijuana laws in WV can result in hefty fines or even jail time.

Is Medical Marijuana Legal in West Virginia?

Cannabis is legal for qualifying patients who possess a West Virginia medical marijuana card from the Department of Health and Human Resources. In order to obtain a certification, patients must have a qualifying condition and receive a written recommendation from a state-licensed physician. Recreational marijuana use is not legal in West Virginia.

Who Qualifies for Medical Marijuana in West Virginia?

West Virginia currently has 16 qualifying conditions for medical marijuana:

  • Chronic or intractable pain
  • ALS
  • HIV/AIDS
  • Cancer
  • Huntington’s disease
  • General seizures
  • Epilepsy
  • MS
  • Crohn’s disease

Can Gun Owners Access Medical Cannabis in West Virginia?

If you have a medical marijuana card in West Virginia, you may be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Every gun purchase requires a federal background check as dictated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

As part of this background check, every prospective gun buyer must complete a Firearms Transaction Records form, which asks (among other things), “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?”

Under federal law, all marijuana use—including medicinal use—is considered unlawful. So as a patient, you must answer “Yes” to the question above. To lie is considered perjury, an offense punishable by up to 5 years in prison. However, if you tell the truth, the dealer is prohibited from selling you a firearm.

If you have questions about your gun ownership rights as a medical marijuana patient, speak to a licensed attorney.

Can I Be Fired for Using Medical Marijuana in West Virginia?

West Virginia is one of a few states in which cannabis users enjoy some degree of protection from workplace disciplinary action. According to the West Virginia Medical Cannabis Act:

No employer may discharge, threaten, refuse to hire or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against an employee regarding an employee’s compensation, terms, conditions, location or privileges solely on the basis of such employee’s status as an individual who is certified to use medical cannabis.

However, the law further states that employers are not required to allow medical cannabis use on the business premises, nor are they required to accommodate employees who perform their job while under the influence.

So in other words, you shouldn’t be suspended, terminated, or otherwise discriminated against just because you’re a medical marijuana patient and test positive for THC on a drug test. However, aside from that, you still have to honor your company’s policies regarding workplace conduct and safety.
