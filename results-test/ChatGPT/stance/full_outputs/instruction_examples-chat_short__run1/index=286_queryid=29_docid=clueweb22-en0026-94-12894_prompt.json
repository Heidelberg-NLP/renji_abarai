Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

    Illegal: contrary to or forbidden by official rules or regulations. Dictionary.com’s definition of illegal seems straightforward. Using this definition, illegal immigrants are what they are: illegal. Forbes estimates 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants resided in the United States as of March 2016. 56% of those unauthorized migrants are from Mexico. Even though some say it is inhumane and unrealistic to deport 11.2 million illegal immigrants, they should be repatriated because of their huge drain

Hence, there’re many factors for the causes and solutions from different branches and the government. “Amnesty?” and “Why blame Mexico?” are two articles that discuss the reasons for millions of Mexicans risking their lives to come illegally to the U.S. and indeed illustrate the writer’s perspectives and ideas for those people. In “Amnesty?”, John F. Kavanaugh, a

    There are over 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, which is why I think that the U.S. should allow the children of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but make the adult illegal immigrants get in line, behind all the other immigrants trying to become citizens. I think this because the children were brought here by their parents, who were probably fleeing the hardships of their home country. I also think the parents should be able to take responsibility for their actions

    Most immigrants in the United States can either be part of the middle class or live in poverty. Based on the results from Ruark and Graham, low-skilled immigrants are more likely to live poverty and lack of health insurance. In their research, immigrants and their children made up about 32% of those who lives in America who does not have health insurance (Ruark and Graham “Immigration, Poverty and Low-Wage Earners”) Without statistic data, one could easily draw out a conclusion: since immigrants cannot

    Should Children of Illegal Immigrants be entitled to a Public Education? In this country, over 100,000 people immigrate to this country every year, and a vast majority of those immigrate here illegally. Of course, like most human beings, those people reproduce, and the children who are the offspring of said illegal immigrants are not allowed a public education in certain states of the US, but I say that leaving children to be uneducated is an atrocity and that it should be changed. Not only are
