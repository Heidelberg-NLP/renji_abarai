Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Not Privatize Prisons

Prisons should not be privatized because punishing criminal activity should not be a profit business. It is not the place of private prisons to administer punishments. It is the State or government that decides who is a prisoner so they should remain responsible for them until rehabilitated. It is wrong to put a private company that makes a profit off a being in charge of prison operations because their goal is profit not punishment or rehabilitation. Private prisons that cut costs may risk security problems because cutting costs often means cutting corners. I think private prisons are wrong, but .


Prison should not be privatized because the path to profit is to treat human beings badly. Prisons are based on two things custody and care. No one wants to cut corners on the custody aspects of a prison. Care is the only part of a budget that has room to be cut. "One way for-profit prisons to minimize costs is by skimping on provisions, including food. " A psychiatrist who investigated a privately run prison in Mississippi found that the inmates were severely underfed and looked "almost emaciated." During their incarceration, prisoners lost anywhere from 10 to 60 pounds." Citation Steven Starkey


Additionally, there is a financial incentive to do a bad job. The more effective a correctional facility is, the less need of its services. If the inmates have educational, work release programs, medical care such as anger management or mental health while locked up its less likely for them to return to a prison after being released. There will never be a point of not needing prisons; if there is better correctional policies and administration could result in a reduction of need. Privatized prisons are disastrous from the point of view of a profit organization.



 Finally, the most important reason Prison should not be privatized is the right to punish belongs only to the state. The criminal justice system is the process by which legally deprive human beings of their guaranteed rights. When someone other than the state tries to deprive someone of these freedoms and rights, charge them with crimes so if it is a privatized prison doing no different than one that committed the crime.



 Prisons should not be privatized because punishing criminal activity should not be a "for profit" business. It is not the place of private prisons to administer prisoner punishments because it is the State government that determine who is a prisoner and they should remain responsible for them until time has been served. Private prisons that cut costs may risk security problems because cutting costs often means cutting corners which is less

1)     I, the reader, feel the topic of this paper is stated quite plainly and a clear position is taken on it because it clearly states that the essay will be talking about why prisons should not be privatized. Each paragraph then gives a clear reason why the author feels privatization of prisons should not be done. 

2)     Name 2 elements of the writing process you think this author needed to consider more thoroughly in stating his/her position.

There are five key elements of the writing process.  Namely: Invention, Organization, Writing, Revising, and Editing. In this case, the author should have considered editing ( to remove the grammatical errors and fix mistakes) and organization (to put the essay in a good format) more thoroughly. 

 

3)     Did you find the research element to be covered sufficiently in this persuasive research essay? Why or Why Not?

No I don't think the element of research was sufficiently covered. To demonstrate that the author carried out enough research, each point should have accompanying citation. However the only research evidence is in the second paragraph. 

4)     Consider the sentence structures here. Do they demonstrate the writer's critical thinking ability in this exercise? Why or Why Not?

The sentence structures demonstrate that the writer has critical thinking ability because he is able to logically connect ideas. The sentences show reflective and independent thinking.

 

5)     List 4 unique errors pertaining to the correct use of APA formatting throughout this paper:

  • No running head
  • The first sentence of each paragraph is not indented 0.5'' to the right.
  • There is no correct in-text citation
  • The reference list is not well formatted as author names are not included

6)     In a brief sentence or two, what would you advise this writer to do to improve the organization of this persuasive essay? The writer should consider to format the essay correctly by clearly subdividing it into introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion sections. The writer should support his points by citing sources and include those citations in the reference list at the end. Also, he should consider revising the sentences and including concise examples to make the essay more captivating to the readers.
