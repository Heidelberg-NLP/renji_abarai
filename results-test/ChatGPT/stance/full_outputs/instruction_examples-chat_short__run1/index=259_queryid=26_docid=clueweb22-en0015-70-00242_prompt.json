Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

A recent report on National Public Radio (NPR) asked the question: does it pay to pay teachers $100,000? This is a not a new question, as in the past researchers, organizations, policymakers, and states have wrestled with questions about how to best compensate their teaching workforce. Now, as more teachers across the country are actually making $100,000, evidence is rolling in answering if paying teachers more improves teacher quality and thus the educational experiences for our nation’s students.

Why Pay Teachers More?

The average teacher in the U.S. makes about $56,000 per year, although this number varies greatly by state and district. Proponents of increased teacher pay argue teachers are underpaid for the hard work of educating children and paying teachers more will improve the recruitment and retention of high-quality teachers.

Other proponents of increasing teacher pay argue teacher salaries have not increased at the rates seen in other professions, and while beginning teacher salaries are not terribly low, the growth of a teacher’s salary throughout his/her career pales in comparison to most other professions.

Restructuring Teacher Pay

There is a growing consensus that teacher pay needs to be restructured. The current system of paying teachers dates back to the 1920’s, and for the majority of states and districts, this system has changed very little over the past 95 years.

Despite the consensus that teacher pay scales need to be changed, there is wide disagreement with regard to how this should look. Proponents of “pay for performance” salary changes (i.e. paying teachers more based on how they do on their annual evaluation, including how their students perform on standardize tests) argue that these types of systems reward the best teachers based on objective measures of performance. However, critics of these types of systems typically counter with teacher evaluations are flawed (particularly when they tie these evaluations to student test scores), and these evaluations may not most accurately reflect effective teaching. Therefore tying increased teacher pay to these systems is an imperfect approach.

Does Increased Teacher Pay Equal Increased Teacher Quality?

In short, yes. While earlier work showed mixed results on whether teacher pay had the potential to improve the quality of the teaching workforce, more recent work shows that paying teachers (and particularly early career teachers) more has the potential to improve student achievement through retention.

Additional research shows breaking away from the traditional model of paying teachers attracts candidates into the teaching profession.

These are promising findings, as overwhelming research finds that teachers improve as they gain experience and early career teachers often leave the profession at higher rates than their more experienced counterparts. Anything that has the potential to keep effective teachers teaching longer is a positive. Paying teachers more and coming up with innovate ways to improve teacher pay should continue to be explored and implemented in all contexts.
