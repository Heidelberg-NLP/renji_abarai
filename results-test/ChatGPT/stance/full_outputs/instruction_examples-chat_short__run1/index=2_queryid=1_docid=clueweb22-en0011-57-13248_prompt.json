Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should teacher get tenure
Text: Most states have laws that protect public school teachers from arbitrary termination once they have attained tenure. Usually, teachers are required to remain employed for a probationary period, and once that period runs its course, they will automatically be tenured. In other states, after a performance review, the local school board will grant the teacher tenure.

What is Tenure?

Tenure indicates that a teacher has achieved an employment status that protects him or her from being terminated without showing sufficient cause. Tenure also means that the teacher’s employment contract is indefinite, and will automatically renew each year.

When is a Teacher Eligible for Tenure?

Prior to attaining tenure, most tenure statutes require a probationary period of employment for teachers. Usually, this is a set amount of years, and after a teacher has remained employed for those required years, they will automatically earn tenure.

As mentioned earlier, some states grant the local school board the authority to grant tenure to teachers, usually following a performance review.

Subject to contractual and constitutional restrictions, teachers who are on probation may be terminated as the school district sees fit. Most likely, the laws that apply to at-will employment will also determine whether a discharge of a teacher was wrongful.

What Protections Does Tenure Provide?

In addition to protecting a teacher from termination without a showing of cause, tenure also provides other protections such as:

  • Salary reductions
  • Demotion
  • Other discipline actions

Though tenure provides some protections, it does not guarantee that a teacher may retain a certain position, such as that of an athletic coach, nor does it guarantee indefinite employment.

When Can a Tenured Teacher Be Dismissed?

A tenured teacher may be dismissed if the school can show cause. Some states have a list that outlines when a school may terminate a teacher, and these circumstances are in-line with those in which a state agency may revoke a teacher’s teaching certification. Examples of cause for dismissal include:

  • Conviction of a crime;
  • Immoral conduct;
  • Neglect of duty;
  • Insubordination;
  • Fraud or misrepresentation;
  • Serious noncompliance with school laws; and/or
  • Incompetence.

What Process is Required to Terminate a Tenured Teacher?

No tenured teacher may be terminated without due process of law. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides the minimum procedural requirements that school districts must satisfy when terminating teachers who have attained tenure.

Due process does not prescribe the reasons of dismissal, rather, it prescribes the necessary procedures that a public school district must follow. In many states, the statutory provisions for the dismissal of a teacher exceed those required under the Due Process Clause.

The United States Supreme Court Case of Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill outlined that a tenured teacher must be given written or oral notice of the dismissal, including the charges against her or him, as well as an explanation of the evidence against her or him, and an opportunity for a fair hearing. The teacher is also afforded the opportunity to appeal the dismissal.

Should You Contact an Attorney?

If you have any questions regarding teacher tenure laws, you should contact an employment attorney in your area. A local government lawyers will be able to advise you of your rights, and provide guidance in how to proceed with your case.

If necessary, your attorney will also be able to represent your best interests in upcoming hearings, assist you with any other actions you may be facing, and also help you file a lawsuit against the school district.
