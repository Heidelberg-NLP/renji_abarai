You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Buffalo Police Department releases body camera policy

and last updated 3:18 PM, Jan 02, 2019

On Wednesday afternoon, Buffalo Police released their new policy for police wearing body cameras while on duty. The full policy is below from the City of Buffalo website.

Buffalo Police Department

Body-Worn Camera Policy

I. Purpose

The Buffalo Police Department ("BPD") is undertaking a Body-Worn Camera ("BWC") Program. The intent of this program is to equip our officers with video and audio recording devices to: (1) document police interactions with the public; (2) to capture and maintain records of crimes in progress for evidence in court; (3) to document police response during the discovery of evidence, investigation into crimes, or calls for service by the public; (4) to improve community relations and transparency; (5) to mitigate potentially confrontational interactions between the police and public through presence of the BWC; (6) to prevent and better resolve complaints made against officers; and (7) to serve in training.

Through this program the BPD hopes to foster a relationship of mutual respect between our officers and the communities in which we serve. The BPD understands that this technology does not solve all challenges that law enforcement and the community face, but it is our hope that this program continues to build on the trust we have worked to build within our community.

This policy covers recording, storing, retaining, releasing, and maintaining data from BWCs.

II. Definitions

A. Agency Administrator – A person chosen from the rank of Lieutenant or higher who is appointed by the Commissioner of Police and has full access to and user rights within the data storage system. He or she can assign and track equipment, control passwords, oversee needed repairs, delete non-evidentiary recordings, conduct audits and quality control reviews and act as a liaison with BWC representatives.

B. Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) – Small video cameras, typically attached to an officer's clothing or helmet that maximizes the camera's ability to capture video and audio data.

C. Footage/Video/Recording – All-encompassing terms to include audio, video, images, data, and metadata recorded by BWCs.

III. Policy and Procedures

A. Use of Devices by Officers

1. All uniformed police officers assigned to the "Patrol Division," "SWAT Division," "Traffic Division," and any other unit with significant interaction with the public, and any other unit that the Commissioner of Police believes is necessary, shall be equipped with BWCs above the midline of their torso, and in a position designed to produce an effective recording. The BWC manufacturer should recommend where the optimal location for the BWC is on an officer's uniform.

2. BPD officers shall only use BWCs issued by the department, and shall not use any home recording devices during their shift.

3. All BPD officers shall be trained on the use of BWCs before being issued or using a device. This training shall be conducted and developed by the Agency Administrator, with the help of representatives from the company that the BWCs are purchased from.

4. BWCs should be used with reasonable care to ensure functionality. Equipment malfunctions or missing equipment should be brought to the officer's supervisor as soon as possible. Officers shall inspect and test the BWC's functionality prior to the beginning of each shift.

5. Officers shall ensure that their assigned BWC is put into a charging unit at the end of their shift.

6. When the BWC is inoperable, it shall be exchanged for an operable unit as soon as possible. If there is no staff working who is able to do this, then the malfunction shall be noted on form P-1375 and transmitted to the Agency Administrator prior to the end of that officer's shift.

B. Recording Procedures

1. Activation – BPD officers who are issued BWCs shall activate the device during the following situations: any call for service; any traffic stop; during the execution of a search or arrest warrant; during any other arrest or custodial stop; while conducting investigatory activities including any search of a person, vehicle, or real property; during a pursuit whether they are on foot or in a vehicle; while conducting traffic control duties; while assigned to a protest or crowd control; during a confrontational or adversarial contact with a citizen; at the request of any civilian; or any other situation as determined necessary by the Commissioner or the Agency Administrator.

2. Deactivation – Once the BWC is turned on, it should not be turned off until the initial incident that caused the devise to be turned on, which can be seen in Section III(B)(1) of this policy, has been stabilized, upon the request of a victim, or as ordered by a supervisor. The event is stabilized when the event has concluded, a victim or witness has left, all persons stopped were released, or when a person arrested has been transferred to the detention facility or police station and is completely in the custody of another officer.

a. When deactivating a BWC, the officer should state on the recording the reason the BWC is being turned off, when is safe to do so.

3. Officers should make an effort to inform citizens and suspects that they are recording the interaction.

4. Officers should ask for on-camera consent to record from crime victims, .

4. Non-recording

a. During any of the situations outlined in Sec. III(B)(1) of this policy, an officer is not required to turn on the BWC if (1) the officer or another person is in immediate danger and turning the BWC on is impractical, (2) turning the BWC on would be impractical and create a tactical disadvantage to the officer, (3) when activating would delay an officer's response to the safety needs of a citizen or a fellow officer, (4) or if a BWC malfunctions. In any of these situations, an o
