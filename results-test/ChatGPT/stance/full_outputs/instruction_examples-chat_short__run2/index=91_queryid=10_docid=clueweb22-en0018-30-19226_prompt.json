Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Stem cells are used to treat so many different serious illnesses, many people now take samples of umbilical cord blood to store in case their child develops a disease such as certain cancers and disorders of the blood.

re: “unfounded rumors abound about it being dangerous”

There have been reports from around the world of very serious adverse reactions to the HPV vaccines.

So far none of my comments with links are going through.

In fact, Harald zur Hausen won the 2008 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering that essentially all cervical cancer is caused by HPV. And half a dozen studies of real girls have found the vaccine is already cutting risk of cin3 precancer by about half, as expected. (And it’s wiping out genital warts, too.) So there’s no question – the vaccine effectively prevents the majority of HPV related diseases.

Remember the MMR vaccine scare, when people became convinced the MMR vaccine caused autism? That turned out to be untrue. Something similar is going on with the HPV vaccine. It’s a touch of collective madness spread by quacks who hate modern medicine and amplified by poorly written news articles. When a child falls ill with any rare disease, some people prefer to blame the HPV vaccine rather than live with not knowing the cause.

That said, any shot can trigger fainting (it’s happened twice to me though not with HPV vaccine), so be sure to sit down for 15 minutes after any shot.

Tara, there is a great deal of evidence that most all cervical cancer is caused by the HPV strains.

Curious that so many extreme vaccine pushers don’t realize that vaccination requirements apply to public AND private schools. If they’re ignorant of the law, perhaps they are also unaware of the quality of the science?

You guys always come up with some reason not to vaccinate. I’d say the answer to your question is “no”. It’s hard to keep up with the laws in every state, especially if that’s not your job.

How much money has Merck given Harvard Medical school over the years? Or the AAP? Or any of the places Dr. McCarthy works for or writes for?

Sadly, the kids who are having life altering reactions to the HPV vaccine are being ignored. Just like the kids who become “autistic” after Merck’s MMR.

Merck destroying lives and not taking responsibility.

So could never getting a license…or never leaving the house, for that matter. It’s despicable how pharmaceutical interest has so greatly co-opted public health initiatives. If an elementary school is a breeding ground for sexually transmitted viruses, then it needs to be shut down and there should be substantial criminal persecution of faculty and parents. All the more shameful to see fear-mongering articles like this from institutions like Harvard. Whatever happened to the risk-benefit ratio we learned about in chemistry? Why are vaccines, especially numerous vaccines, continually touted as though they’re risk-free? The HPV vaccine is especially prone to adversarial response. What will be the cut-off in terms of schedule size? Exactly how many children have to be injured before their safety is put before profit margins? This vaccine is simply unnecessary, especially when you consider there is little evidence that said virus is linked to cancer.
