Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Why America Needs Stricter Gun Control Laws

Gun control is hardly a settled issue in American politics and a popular topic for speeches and debates. One side maintains that any infringement on the right to bear arms cannot be tolerated, whereas other argue that some restrictions may be appropriate in order to ensure a safer society. This sample argumentative essay argues in favor for stricter gun control laws.

The problem of loose gun laws in America

Gun control is a highly debated issue in America that is currently making headlines today. Those in favor of gun control argue that stricter laws are needed to make it harder for criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill to obtain weapons.

On the other hand, opponents of strict gun control regulations claim that the Second Amendment gives Americans the right to have guns to protect themselves. As a result, this debate focuses on who should be allowed to own guns and which rights gun owners should have when they have a legal weapon in their possession.

The Second Amendment problem

While there is good and bad to both sides of the debate on gun control, this debate is an Issue of Policy, and action is needed to enforce stricter gun control laws. Although the government may pass strict laws regarding gun ownership and usage, it is up to the states to enforce these laws. In addition, although the Bill of Rights gave Americans the right to bear arms, there is a debate on how this outdated Amendment should be interpreted today.

Nonetheless, stricter gun control laws are needed since gun control makes weapons less accessible to criminals and the mentally ill, it can reduce the number of murders in our country, and the Second Amendment was targeted towards militias and does not give all Americans the constitutional right to own a weapon.

Security as priority over freedom

Stricter gun control laws are needed since mandatory background checks to possess a firearm helps to ensure that criminals, mentally ill individuals, or terrorists who pose a threat to national security will not obtain and misuse a firearm. Although criminals have been known to illegally obtain guns through the black market, background checks for purchasing and privately transferring guns helps to prevent criminals from acquiring weapons since those on parole and probation are not allowed to possess weapons.

Further, Erica Goode argued that the Dark Knight shooting in Aurora, Colorado was carried out by a mentally ill individual, and stricter gun control laws can stop mentally ill people from repeating these shooting. Finally, stricter gun control laws make it difficult for terrorists to obtain weapons in the United States. Therefore, tougher gun control laws, including mandatory background checks, would prevent these individuals from being able to obtain and misuse a firearm.

Reducing rates of murder caused by guns

In addition, stricter gun control laws are needed since they can reduce the number of violent crimes in society. In 2010, 12,996 people were murdered in the United States, and 8,775 of these deaths were due to firearms (Economic Policy Journal). These shocking statistics not only prove that violence from the misuse and abuse of gun privileges are a leading cause of death in this country, but they also show that tougher laws are needed to prevent innocent children, women, and men from being murdered.

Also, murders can happen accidentally with a firearm if the weapon is loaded with ammunition and not locked in a safe place. Nevertheless, since murders involving firearms are a leading cause of death in our country, an action is needed to enforce tougher gun control laws in the United States.

Right to bear arms a myth

Finally, stricter gun control laws in the United States are needed since the Second Amendment of the Constitution does not give all Americans the right to possess weapons. Many American citizens feel that owning a gun is their constitutional right and that they should be able to use the gun as they please.

However, the Second Amendment states “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” (Cornell University, 2013).

This Amendment was written for military units and explained that those people who are protecting the security of our country have the right to possess weapons. Therefore, only military officials who are protecting the security of the United States have the constitutional right to bear firearms. Looking at the Constitution from this point, it is possible to reduce violent crimes without infringing on the Second Amendment.

Opposing views regarding stricter gun control

Conversely, opponents to enforcing stricter gun control laws argue through debate and essay writing that gun control laws will not prevent criminals, mentally ill individuals, or terrorists from owning guns. Jim Denison argued that criminals can still gain access to guns through the black market, and mentally ill individuals can obtain a firearm from another person, such as a relative.

Although it is agreed that criminals, mentally ill people, and terrorists can obtain a firearm through the black market, the fact is that many criminals run the black market. Therefore, by making background checks mandatory, we can try to eliminate a black market for firearms and prevent criminals from owning and selling guns.

Additionally, opponents argue that sensible gun control regulations are not needed to reduce the number of murders in the United States since homicides are already decreasing in our country.

Sherry Murphy, Jiaquan Xu, and Kenneth Kochanek explained that “homicides have dropped as one of the leading causes of death for the first time since 1965.”

While these statistics do show that homicides have decreased in the United States, we can eliminate all murders by firearms, such as suicides, through banning guns or by toughening gun control laws.

Conclusion

To conclude, stricter gun control laws are needed since gun control makes weapons less accessible to criminals and the mentally ill, it can reduce the number of murders in our country, and the Second Amendment was targeted towards militias and does not give all Americans the constitutional right to own a weapon.

While opponents argue that tougher gun control laws are not needed since people buy weapons through the black market, the number of homicides in our country has decreased, and the Second Amendment gives all citizens the right to possess a firearm, the fact remains that murders are still high in the United States. In all, if stricter gun control laws were implemented in all states, society would be a lot safer since the only people who would possess a firearm would be those are legally able or trained to use one.
