Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should government allow illegal immigrant become citizen
Text: Should illegal immigrants have an easier path to citizenship? | Debate.org
  • Yes they should

    There's no good reason to keep spending money arresting and deporting immigrants. Furthermore, there are a lot of people serving years in federal prison for the crime of illegal immigration, which is wasting even more money. It's a big waste that accomplishes next to nothing. We've got plenty of room here, so open up!

  • Not much reason to make it harder for them to become citizens

    Undocumented immigrants pay back most of what they earn, and don't really have much of a negative impact on our economy. Many would argue they're beneficial to our economy, and there's no use spending money on deporting people just because they came from a country with a lot of drug dealers. That would be like saying "64% of shooters since 1982 have been white men, so all white men should be deported!" I'm not saying everyone should be a citizen, but most undocumented immigrants are just here to make money to bring back to their families. I think it's wrong to deport someone for that.

  • YES immigrants should be given an opportunity to citizen ship.

    I say yes because some immigrants want to come in to this country because of the threats they face in their country's and so they are in search for a better life. Also this country was built on immigrants because no one is originally from this country except the Native Americans.

  • Citizins can't pass the citizen ship test.

    I would like you to take the citizenship test! If we gave high school sieniors the test most of them would fail it. I think we should have schools for the immigrants to learn what they need to to pass the test. Yes, they should take it, but after they learn the material.

  • Yes they should

    They are people too we have to look at it as if we were in there shoes. We are hurting them and what did they ever do to us. Would we want to me forced away from our parents at such a young age such as if we were 14 years old. We would never survive out in this world by our selves at this age.

  • No, it should be harder.

    Illegal immigrants should not have an easier path to citizenship. They came to the country illegally and should have to take a harder citizenship test than those who try to come live here the right way. Why should we reward those who do wrong? Most of the time these are Mexican and Cuban people who do this and where do most of the illegal drugs come from? These two places. Not only that, but these same people are often the ones who become drug dealers. Who pays when they are imprisoned for their crimes? Taxpayers have to pay. People who have resided here their entire lives end up paying the price. If they do not become drug dealers, they have a lot of children and go on welfare to collect money to feed them and their children. Again, this comes out of the taxpayers hard earned money. These are reasons I do not think it is fair to allow illegal immigrants an easier path to gain citizenship.

  • Illegal Immigrants Should Not Have an Easier Path to Citizenship

    Because there an Illegal Immigrant. Also because all they do is work on a farm in the United States when they could be doing the same thing in Mexico. Also because the world would be way better without them being here. So thats why they should not have a easier path.

  • No they should not.

    Illegal immigrants should not have an easier path to citizenship, they came here illegally, they should be sent back to their country, no questions asked. The people who have not come here yet and are on the waiting list however should have an easier time. They need to make the test easier, and need to make it cheaper.

  • They are ILLEGAL immigrants

    As their descriptive title suggests, illegal immigrants are BREAKING THE LAW. They are considered criminals. Just because they were able to cross the border or somehow find a physical path to the United States, it doesn't mean they can escape prosecution. They are stealing from our government, the same way a bank robber steals from a bank. They cann
