Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should voting age lower
Text: Matt Gillow

After a debate on Votes at 16 was filibustered out of a vote, here are three reasons not to support lowering the voting age.

As Conservative ex-chancellor George Osborne joined the campaign to lower the voting age in the UK to 16, many thought that the tides were turning. However, Tory MPs filibustered the debate – speaking for too long to allow a vote, as Labour MPs shouted ‘shame’ across the chamber. The Deputy Speaker even had to wade in, exclaiming that he wasn’t at a football match. So why shouldn’t we be supporting votes at 16?

16 year olds don’t know enough about politics

This is a sweeping generalisation, of course,e but one I’m sure the majority can attest to. I certainly know that at 16, I didn’t have enough knowledge about politics to vote responsibly. The problem here is a lack of political education, and this is something that should certainly be addressed before MPs try to force through virtue signalling bills.

16 year olds are more easily influenced by parents and guardians

This point ties in with the first – a general lack of political knowledge means any debates with family or friends can easily tip you one way or the other with your vote. Technically, in many cases, parents to 16 year olds may be handed an ‘extra vote’ in cases where their child isn’t politically savvy, undermining democratic principles. 

16 year olds can’t do everything politicians tell you they can

Yes, they can join the army – but not as frontline soldiers and with parental permission. Yes, they can marry their MP… if their parents give permission. 16 year olds don’t pay tax, they can’t drink, they can’t go into nightclubs. Politicians and votes at 16 campaigners will tell you that 16 year olds can do EVERYTHING but vote. This isn’t true.
