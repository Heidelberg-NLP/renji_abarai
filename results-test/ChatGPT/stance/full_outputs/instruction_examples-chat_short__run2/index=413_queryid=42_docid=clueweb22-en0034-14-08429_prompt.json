Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Blackhawks honor Troy Murray on Hockey Fights Cancer Night

Troy Murray

t was an emotional evening on Sunday at the United Center, where the Blackhawks hosted Hockey Fights Cancer Night.I

Former Blackhawks center and current radio broadcaster Troy Murray, who's battling cancer, was celebrated throughout the night in his first public appearance since the diagnosis in August. On the purple carpet event, the ceremonial puck drop, the TV and radio broadcasts, during the commercial timeouts, you name it: Chicago showered Murray with love and support.

"He's obviously been around for the whole time I've been here," Patrick Kane said. "Just a fun guy to see in the locker room and talk to about hockey and just life in general. Always got a smile on his face, positive attitude. You can see him out there tonight, he was just smiling, happy. He seems like he was grateful to be out there. It was great to see him."

Nobody can put a smile on your face quicker than Troy, which made the 2-0 loss to the San Jose Sharks sting even more.

"I wish we were able to get a win for him," Connor Murphy said. "We said it before the game, we were playing for him and for everyone battling, present and past. It's an emotional night, seeing everyone out here supporting him and supporting everyone with their signs, who they're fighting for. It's a great thing that he was able to come out today. We've all been thinking of him. He's been in our prayers for months now. It's really awesome to see his face here."

The frustrating part is that the Blackhawks did everything but win the hockey game.

Just look at the numbers:

  •   The Blackhawks had 8:14 of offensive zone possession time, according to Sportlogiq. The Sharks had 4:04.
  •   The Blackhawks set a new season-high in shot attempts (76) and scoring chances (38), according to Natural Stat Trick. They allowed only 22 shots on goal, which was their second-fewest in a game this season.
  •   The Blackhawks had an expected Goals For of 2.48. The Sharks had an expected Goals For of 2.01.

"Honestly, I think our game today was probably the best hockey game we’ve played all year for three periods," interim head coach Derek King said. "I’ll take that every night. If we play like that for three periods, I’ll take that."

It's hard to disagree, which sounds funny to say considering his team scored zero goals. But the reality is, the Blackhawks probably win this game nine out of 10 times if they replayed it.

Regardless, it was another game where the Blackhawks were trying to grind out a low-scoring win. Until they find a way to break out offensively, we might see more of that moving forward.

"It's a tough league," Kane said. "That's kind of the situation we're in with this team now. You look at the last few games, even the games we've been successful, we've found a way to get a late goal and win 1-0 or 3-2 in overtime. Looks like that's the way we're going to have to play to be successful."

While a win would've made Sunday night so much sweeter, the highlight of the day was seeing a familiar face back at the United Center in Troy Murray.

"It’s been tough not having him around, just like his smile and positive energy around," Ryan Carpenter said. "We really miss him. We’ve been thinking about him and praying for him a lot."

Fight on, TM19.
