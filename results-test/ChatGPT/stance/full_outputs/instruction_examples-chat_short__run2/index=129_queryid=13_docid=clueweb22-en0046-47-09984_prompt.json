Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Alternative Resources for Energy Instead of Fossil Fuels Essay

Satisfactory Essays
Alternative resources for energy are being used instead of fossil fuels being used .Fossil fuels create greenhouse gases which accumulate in the atmosphere and harms it. Some alternative options for getting energy are using solar, hydro, and wind power. Not only are these alternatives better for the environment they can still be used when fossil fuels run out. Solar energy is one of the alternatives to fossil fuels. Solar energy is used to create electricity in two ways. The first process is using sunlight to heat up water that creates high-pressure steam that spins turbine blades. The second process involves the movement and displacement of electrons to absorb the sun's radiation and create electricity (Energy Kids). Solar energy can be…show more content…
The turbines transform 2/3 of the energy in wind into electricity; which is more than fossil fuels transform. One downside to using wind power is that the turbines stand out and ruin the beauty of natural lands. Wind power is environment friendly and generates lots of power for people. Many places have started to use hydro power because many areas have become hotter and wetter. To work hydro power relies on the water cycle, and it harnesses the mechanical energy from moving water. Most of hydro power comes from reservoirs, but sometimes running rivers are used. The amount of available energy in moving water is determined by its flow or fall (Energy Kids). The water flows through a pipe, or penstock, then pushes against and turns blades in a turbine to spin a generator to produce electricity (Energy Kids). In a run-of-the-river system, the force of the current applies the needed pressure, while in a storage system, water is accumulated in reservoirs created by dams, then released as needed to generate electricity (Energy Kids). Hydroelectric dams burn no fuel, and release no polluting gases that can cause environmental powers. Hydro power is used by many countries and is friendly to the environment. Having alternative energy resources that are friendly to the environment is important for the future to have less pollution. The amount of greenhouse gases that get released into the
