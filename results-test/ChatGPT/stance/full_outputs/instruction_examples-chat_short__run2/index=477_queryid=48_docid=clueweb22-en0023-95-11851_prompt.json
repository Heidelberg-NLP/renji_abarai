Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: should voting age lower
Text: Why and how Canada should lower the voting age to 16

Why and how Canada should lower the voting age to 16

Few today would question the right of 18-year-olds to vote in elections. Until as recently as 1971 however, Canadians younger than 21 years of age were barred from casting a ballot for federal elections. A survey conducted in 1958 also found that 71.6 percent of respondents were opposed to lowering the voting age to 18 from 21.  Social norms and attitudes are in a constant state of flux, but decisive shifts in national public opinion often take years, with legislative change acting as a catalyst. In the current context of rapidly falling youth political participation, lowering the voting age to 16 could increase political engagement among youth, strengthen democracy by boosting voter turnout in the long term, and bring youth issues closer to the forefront.

Since the 1980s, a combination of falling participation rates and the fact that younger voters make up a smaller and smaller proportion of voters has meant that the political force of youth is in comparative decline.

The 2015 federal election saw a surge in youth participation, and yet, it followed in a larger trend where youth voter turnout has usually been at least 20 percent lower than that of older Canadians.

This is particularly worrisome if one considers that young people will increasingly make up a smaller share of the total population.  The consequences of youth disengagement are far-reaching. In the short term, governments become less representative and may increasingly favour older voters in their policies.  In the long term, low participation rates among today’s young people could pose a considerable threat to the integrity of Canadian democracy. Low voter participation rates drain legitimacy of governments in a vicious spiral in which poor turnout feeds skepticism towards democracy, and vice versa.

 

Low youth voter turnout is likely equally pronounced at provincial and municipal elections, though age-specific data is scarce. Nonetheless, data from Quebec show similar falling rates of voter turnout in its provincial elections among youth aged 18-34 since 1985.

Until recently, a “life cycle effect”, or the idea that young people’s propensity to vote increased as they aged, was used to explain lower turnout rates among youth. Recent studies indicate that this may no longer be the case. Young people are not only participating less than their elders, but their willingness to participate also appears to be declining over time. The result is that Canada’s arguably most educated generation is also increasingly disenchanted with the current political system. Youth are not disengaged with political life per se, but rather that they feel that formal political institutions are failing to listen to their needs.

How lowering the voting age could help

To strengthen Canadian democracy, governments should rebuild young Canadians’ trust in and attachment to formal political institutions and practices. Young people do not get enough exposure to the political process in ways that matter to them. Reducing the voting age to 16 could increase future and current engagement to Canada’s political system by giving young Canadians a meaningful voice at the table at a crucial juncture in their lives. After all, the most visible, and often most meaningful political engagement for most Canadians is casting a ballot.  Research shows that voting habits are formed early in life and that those who do not vote early on may never pick up the habit.

Why lower the voting age to 16?

Lowering the voting age to 16 would be no arbitrary choice. From an implementation standpoint, a major advantage is that most 16 and 17-year-olds still reside at home, meaning that voter registration would be similar to that of their parents or could be done at schools.  Simultaneously, Canada could bring back the vouching option removed in Bill C-23 to allow teachers and principals to vouch for their students on Election Day.

Lowering the voting age should not be seen as an easy solution but rather as part of a larger initiative in partnership with other levels of government. For instance, provincial governments  should  introduce and expand class time devoted to civics and political institutions as youth progress though compulsory education. With some creativity and little cost to schools, students could come to see these class discussions as not merely abstract and inconsequential but as having a direct bearing on elections. Election Day could become an exciting day in schools where students see their peers and teachers publicly exercise their right to vote.

Impact

Lowering the voting age would send a strong message to youth that their opinions matter and that the electoral system is not stacked against them.  Lured by the possibility of obtaining extra votes, political candidates may be tempted to increase their presence at high schools and other spaces frequented by youth.  The result could be completely new spaces for political discussion and for youth civic engagement.  As parties come to see the potential of speaking to a large and concentrated pool of voters, they may even incorporate more meaningful youth policies in their platforms.

Canada is not alone in its struggle to engage young citizens to vote; it could learn from the experience of other jurisdictions. Austria’s decision to lower the voting age to 16 has yielded some positive results: data from two recent regional elections show that voter turnout among 16-17-year-olds reached levels close to the national turn-out rate.

Lastly, for those who argue that 16-year-olds are not sufficiently experienced or mentally unfit to vote, they should remember that similar arguments were once made against granting women, ethnic minorities and Indigenous people the right to vote in Canada.
