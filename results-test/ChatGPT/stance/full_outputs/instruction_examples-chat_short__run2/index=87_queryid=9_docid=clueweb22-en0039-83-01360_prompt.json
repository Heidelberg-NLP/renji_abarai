Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should students wear uniforms in school? 

 

Did you ever be asked to wear uniforms in school? Which type of school did you go to? Do you like the uniform policy, or do you prefer wearing normal clothes in school? What’s your first thought on this question? In today’s blog, I will be talking about the pros of school uniforms and why people from different standpoints support the uniform policy. 

 

When I first see the term “school uniform”, I first connect it with private schools because it seems to be more common to have a uniform policy in private schools than in public schools. However, there has been a trend towards uniforms in public schools. Though the public school I went to did not require students to wear uniforms. There are many other public schools across the country that have uniform requirements. According to the statistics below, in recent years, more and more public schools began to require uniforms. In 2015-2016, over 25 percent of public schools required students to wear uniforms. Why does uniform policy become so popular? What is the attitude of the students towards this problem?

Firstly, school uniforms can protect students from bullying issues. Wearing uniforms help students to feel inclusive in school since everyone wears the same. They do not need to worry about others may judge them due to their outfits. In addition, school uniforms also help the issue between upper grades students and lower grades students. In many schools, the conflict between the two groups is a big concern. Some schools even arrange the two groups in different buildings to help this issue. But wearing uniforms can effectively address this problem. In many school bully cases, the conflict rises from a tiny issue such as the looking. Wearing uniforms in a way makes everyone look the same in appearance. Peer pressure of students is reduced. Therefore, a big part of conflicts can be avoided. Wearing uniforms also gives students a feeling that the school is a family. They will feel closer to their classmates who wear the same uniform. The school spirit is enhanced. As a result, fewer bully cases would occur in schools by wearing uniforms. Students in school are protected by just wearing uniforms!

 

Secondly, school uniforms protect students from all kinds of safety issues. “In Long Beach, CA, after two years of a district-wide K-8 mandatory uniform policy, reports of assault and battery in the district’s schools decreased by 34%, assault with a deadly weapon dropped by 50%, fighting incidents went down by 51%, sex offenses were cut by 74%, robbery dropped by 65%, possession of weapons (or weapon “look-alikes”) decreased by 52%, possession of drugs went down by 69%, and vandalism was lowered by 18%” (M. Sue Stanley). “One year after Sparks Middle School in Nevada instituted a uniform policy, school police data showed a 63% drop in police log reports, and decreases were also noted in gang activity, student fights, graffiti, property damage, and battery (Claudene Wharton). From the data above, uniform policy is found to be an effective method to deter crime and increase student safety.

 

Last but not least, wearing uniforms helps students focus on studying by reducing the comparison. If students are required to wear uniforms, they do not need to spend time thinking about what they should wear tomorrow. They do not need to pay attention to the latest trend since they do not compare themselves with other students. “A study by the University of Houston found that elementary school girls’ language test scores increased by about three percentile points after uniforms were introduced” (Elisabetta Gentile and Scott A). Avoiding the comparison helps students to focus on study. In addition, the uniform policy saves parents time and money. Parents do not need to struggle about looking for proper clothes for their children. By buying the uniform suit, which can be used for multiple years, parents obviously saved a huge amount of money on children’s normal clothing. As a result, uniform policy not only helps students focus on studying but also eases parents’ worry.

 

People from different standpoints are supporting the school uniform policy. Parents would like their children to wear uniforms in school so that they do not need to spend more on children’s clothing. Their children will also be more focused on studying by wearing uniforms. Therefore, many parents are supporting the uniform policy. Also, teachers will be happy to see students wearing uniforms. Since uniform policy addresses the school bully issue in a way, teachers will have less trouble to solve. Students more focusing on studying also motivates teachers to teach in school. The effectiveness of education will also improve. Therefore, teachers are willing to have a uniform policy. In addition, the school likes the uniform policy because wearing uniforms makes the students look tidier and reflects the school spirit. Uniforms make students look like a whole. As a result, parents, teachers, and schools all prefer that students wear uniforms. 

 

However, students’ opinions vary from individuals. Some students like the idea of uniforms so that they do not need to struggle with their outfits in the school morning. But some students dislike the uniforms because they wanted the freedom to express themselves by wearing the clothes they like. I found two student representatives’ comments on this issue.

 

  1. Yuna Chong, 9

From Santa Clara, California

“Uniforms are as much about safety as they are about inclusion. Teachers don’t have to worry about losing sight of students at the playground or on a field trip. Also, when kids wear uniforms, both the older and younger students feel like they are part of the same group. I wear a uniform and feel like my school is one big team. I feel included. I think it is harder to bully someone about his or her clothes if you are all wearing the same thing. When everyone is dressed the same, you don’t have to worry about how you look or about wearing the latest trend. Parents can save money, as well! And in the morning, I can save time because I don’t have to choose what kind of clothes I should wear.”

 

2. Emerson Sperling, 12

  From Sterling Heights, Michigan

“I don’t think kids should have to wear a uniform. If students are wearing the exact same thing, they can’t express themselves. Kids should feel like they can be their own person. They shouldn’t have to match. During school hours, we should also be comfortable. If we’re in scratchy shirts and uncomfortable dress pants, we’re not going to focus very well. I get that the teachers don’t want us focusing on everyone else’s clothing, but it’s still uncomfortable to be in a uniform all day. Also, parents have to go shopping and spend a lot of money on the uniforms. If students could wear normal clothes, we’d be able to express ourselves, be comfortable, and not spend money on outfits that we never wear at home.”

 

In conclusion, school uniforms help address the school bullying issue, safety issue, and help students focus on studying, not their clothes. Through the uniform policy, parents save costs. Teachers have less trouble and schools become more united. Therefore they all favor the idea of uniforms. But not all students like this idea. The reasons vary depending on individuals. Do you think students should wear uniforms?

  1. I personally went to a public school that didn’t require school uniforms, so I might be biased, but I don’t find the idea of uniforms very appealing. For me, choosing my outfit every morning was exciting and I was able to express myself through my clothing choices. It is also cost effective for low-income families because they don’t have to spend a lot of money on school uniforms. The uniforms might reduce bullying, but overall I think they give kids more freedom on what to wear and how to express themselves.

  2. Having gone to private school from the ages of 4 till 13 I actually enjoyed having uniforms. It made it so much easier in the mornings knowing I already had a planned outfit and everyone else would be dressed the same. I however also do understand that the clothes we wear allow us to be more creative. Especially as a young child who would want to explore fashion. But it is also very interesting to learn that it helps low-income families and is more cost-effective for them.
