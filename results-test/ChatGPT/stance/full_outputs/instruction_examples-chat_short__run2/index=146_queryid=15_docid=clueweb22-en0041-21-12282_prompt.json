Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Why Animal Testing Should Not Be Banned

Good Essays
Every year, millions of animals were suffering or killed due to scientific research. Some animal rights groups suggest that we should ban animal experiments because use animals for experimentation is cruel and animals should have the same right of living as human beings. A report from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that more than 100 million animals are killed in U.S. laboratories for biology lessons, medical experimentation, and chemical, drug, food, and cosmetics testing. There are some other people believe that the death of animals will help and save millions of human lives. Personally I believe that the experimentation on animals for scientific and medical should not be stopped.

The contribution of animal testing is significance. A report from California Biomedical Research Association states that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example Diabetics used to be the disaster to humans before the insulin was found. Frederick G. Banting solved this problem by doing

The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) of United States gives some protections to warm-blooded animals used in research laboratories, which only cover 5% of animals normally used for testing. Under AWA, all testing on animals which are covered must minimized the pain on animals and provide appropriate veterinary care. The AWA should make further improvements which cover as much animals as possible. In UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 defined regulated procedures as animal experiments that could potentially cause "pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm”. It prevents animals from unnecessary suffering. Actually all testing and research done on animals should be under the control of government. The last and the most things is that it’s our responsibilities to take care of all the animals, even though they are just using for
