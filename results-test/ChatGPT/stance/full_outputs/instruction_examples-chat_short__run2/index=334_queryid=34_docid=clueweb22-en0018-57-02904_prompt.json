Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: social networking site good society
Text: Is social networking a boon to society? | Debate.org
  • Contact with the real world is lost.

    A cellphone does not bring you close to people but takes you far away from the person sitting next to you! Today people prefer to text or call a person rather than going to meet them. This increases the distance between people and the device which was supposed to bring people close becomes the key factor that makes them un-social. In parties and get-togethers people are so lost in their phones that they don't mix up with the people present.

  • It is definitely a boon.

    Every thing has a good side and a bad side. It completely depends on us how to use it. If used efficiently, it can result in a positive way but if we use it carelessly it can consequently result in bad way so moreover it is a good thing but our minds have tried to make it a bad one.

  • Of course! It is

    Nowadays social media plays an important role in teenagers life. The vast majority of teenagers in the United States are daily social media users. There are countless of social networking sites that have created broad connections among teens. For example, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Skype, YouTube, and the like are used quite frequently. According to Shea Bennett, one out of every seven minutes spent online is on Facebook. But does social media have positive impact on teens? To me the answer is yes. For the vast majority of teens, the overall impact on social media has been positive (Rideout). Social media helps teens stay connected to each other even if they are a thousand miles away, and it keeps us up to date with what's going on around the world and so on. Social media has positive impact on teens in many ways.
    Social media helps strengthen relationships among teens. Many people have friends who they have not seen since school, or who have moved away, and they want to stay connected with. They don't have to worry about losing touch, because social media has it covered. Through social media teens can stay connected with friends no matter the distance or time. Just by simply sending a friend request and accepting it, then starting a chat you can be easily be back in touch again. Social networks have provided people with the opportunity to connect with others and build better relationships with friends with whom we are unable to meet personally, and letting them know about our life and take input about their lives and events happening with them (Ali).
    As an teenager it's also very important to understand what's going on around us rather than just knowing what's going with friends. According to the article "What Facebook and Twitter Mean for News." Nowadays teens receive digital news from social media sites rather than turning on news channel or reading newspaper. 70% of teens receive most of the news stories they read or watch via Facebook or Twitter. It's amazing how fast news spread on social networking sites. According to Amy Mitchell, "Facebook news users get more news from friends and family and see it as news they might well have gotten someplace else if Facebook did not exist. For Twitter users, though, the news links come from a more even mix of family and friends and news organizations. Most of these users also feel that without Twitter, they would have missed this kind of news". Thus, social media results in teens being more well-informed about national and global news than they would be otherwise.
    Social media has become part of the modern teenage lifestyle. It makes our life so much easier and much more efficient. It has become an essential part of our communication culture that cannot be taken away easily, because we are so dependent on it. Without social media we wouldn't be able to connect with people the way we do now.

  • Yes because it is a goo way to increase friend circle.

    It has definitely been a boon to society. Over twenty years ago the only way we had to keep in touch with others was by snail mail or phone.

Without social networking alot of this may not have been possible.And also it depend on us whether we use it as a boon or bane.

  • Boon to society

    The biggest gifts that mankind has got is technology and more so, it is the information technology that has brought this world closer. While growth, development and speed of progress have increased due to this, a special bonding is happening between human beings. This is through the social networking. Well, internet has got many social networking sites such as Facebook, Orkut, Twitter etc and this has become the special platform for strangers to become friends or as a powerful tool of communication.

    But here is the big question- is social networking really a boon or bane? especially in the case of students and today's generation. Yes, there is no doubt that this helps increase your friends circle, the opportunity to interact with different people and make new friends across the world. But many are asking if the social networking sites are indeed being used for such productive reasons. There has been an increasingly disturbing behaviour found in students and youngsters after their exposure towards such sites.

    Their interaction with family members, their concentration towards studies, their interest in outdoor activities have come down drastically. Moreover, youngsters are being lured by conmen and other shady individuals through these sites and this is leading to grave risk. A recent incident of an IIM student committing suicide after knowing about her boyfriend through a social networking site is a clear example of how extreme things can become.

    The experts are suggesting that using of social networking is not wrong but the way it is being used is important. Students and youngsters must be given guidance on what should be the dos and dont's. Also, the students must be educated on the overall developmental activities instead of getting glued to the mobile phones and computers and spending precious time chatting. Students from their end must take initiative to find out how best such sites can be used. So folks, wake up and use technology as a boon and not a bane.

  • Yes, but not in Design

    I love Facebook, the idea of Facebook, anyway. I love the concept of being directly connect with all of your friends and peers, and having that instant access to what's going on in anyone's life at the touch of a button. But, this instant access, this instant gratification is causing everything we've evolved to accept as a society, in terms of socialization, to change. Now, societies evolve, and we're approaching the time when this needs to be addressed, a society where people communicate mind to mind, text to text, instead of eye-to-eye or face-to-face. Boon is a bit harsh, but it IS changing society, for better or for worse.

  • absolutely

    It goes way beyond the original posters points. We socialize with people regardless of international borders. This helps to break down walls that our governments try to build up around us. In fact our own U.S. government is fighting right now to control the net. The net, and social networking, spells freedom.

  • No, it's not good.

    Kids and teenagers growing up, have no sense of manners in a public forum. They are also becoming more socially awkward as they hardly interact with people face-to-face. Instead they just text or message someone. This is only going to lead to flaws in the future as we become an un-sociable society.
