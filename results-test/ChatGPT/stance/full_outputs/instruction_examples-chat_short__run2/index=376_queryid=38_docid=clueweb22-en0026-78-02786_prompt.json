pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Why it's best to seek advice from a marijuana doctor online

In many circumstances, family doctors are hesitant to offer medicinal cannabis because they are unaware of the possible medical benefits of treatment. Most medical schools’ curricula don’t touch the endocannabinoid system. This is where Releaf Clinics can help patients looking to Medical Marijuana for their symptoms. Our fully-licensed physicians, all of whom are registered with Medical Boards in each State we serve, have spent additional time learning about the health benefits of cannabis. They are aware of the medical problems for which it is prescribed and how it can aid such ailments. Ask as many questions as you want during your consultation! Our doctors are well-versed in the subject.

What Patients Are Saying About Releaf Clinics

Frequently Asked Questions

A medical marijuana card is an identification card issued by the state that will permit a qualified patient to buy cannabis from a licensed dispensary, possess, or cultivate cannabis for medical purposes.

Step 1: You must visit a state-licensed physician (not a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant) to obtain a physician certification.

Step 2: Apply for an identification card from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.

Step 3: Once your application is approved and you receive your identification card, purchase medical marijuana from a state-licensed dispensary.

It is 100% legal. Releaf Clinic health practitioners are licensed to practice in the state where they provide services. Our online solution complies with state telehealth legislation, and we store all of our clients’ personal information on a HIPAA-compliant database to preserve their privacy.

Each state that permits the use of medical marijuana has its own list of qualified medical conditions. Cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, and any other sickness for which marijuana gives treatment are all on the list of qualifying conditions for medicinal marijuana in most states. 

Unfortunately, we do not accept any forms of insurance. Because marijuana is still federally banned, no insurance companies will pay for medical marijuana recommendations at this time.

Releaf Clinics charges $150 for new patients and $99 for renewing patients. We also offer payment plans as well. If you have any other questions about pricing please call us at (888) 479-7736.
