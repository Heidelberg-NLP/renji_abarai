Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Why Hockey Should Ban Fighting

This article is more than 6 years old.

The Toronto Globe and Mail recently ran a story on Robert Frid. Frid fought hundreds of times over three years of junior hockey and eight seasons in the minor leagues. He’s had at least 75 concussions and was knocked unconscious many times. Declared permanently disabled in his 30s, Frid, now 41, doesn’t think he has much time left.

The misery he endured in his hockey career raises a very simple question: Isn’t it well past time for professional hockey at all levels to ban fighting?

Frid is most likely suffering brain damage from all the hits he took. His long-term memory is poor. He has anxiety disorder and headaches and, the story reports, says he usually can’t sleep through the night.

Frid is hardly alone. From Derek Boogaard to Wade Belak to Todd Ewan, a long series of pro-hockey enforcers have left a legacy of depression, pain and suicides. Can these problems all be attributed to taking blows to the head during fights? Who knows? But hockey ought to care. Fighting has no place in hockey.

And before the whining about wussification of everything begins, save it. Why should any sport allow fights among players? Entertainment? Well, it was once held that fans would not tolerate helmets. Hell, some once argued that fans would not tolerate face masks on goalies! Who cares what fans think? It isn’t their heads getting beaten on for years. They don’t have to live with the reality of depression and suicide.

Fights among players, whether "enforcers" or stars, whether in the lower minors or the NHL, ought to be against the rules. Drop your gloves, take a swing and you are gone for the rest of the game.

Some will say the Robert Frids of the world would have no hockey career were fighting banned. The correct answer is to that statement is--good. If you lack true hockey skills you don’t belong on a roster any more than a bar-room brawler belongs on a baseball squad or a martial arts master on a women’s softball team. If you can’t play at a pro level than even if you are willing to get your brains beat in for a paycheck and even if some fans delight in the blood, you need to find another line of work.

The NHL and other pro leagues should not indulge thuggery any more. It comes at too high a price and shows indifference to those who are asked to get hurt by make brawling part of the game. It is time to do the right thing and get the goonery gone.
