Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

SHOULD NOT PRIVATIZE PRISONSShould Not Privatize PrisonsPrisons should not be privatized because punishing criminal activity should not be aprofit business. It is not the place of private prisons to administer punishments.It is the State orgovernment that decides who is a prisoner so they should remain responsible for them untilrehabilitated. It is wrong to put a private company that makes a profit off a being in charge ofprison operations because their goal is profit not punishment or rehabilitation. Private prisonsthat cut costs may risk security problems because cutting costs often means cutting corners. Ithink private prisons are wrong, butPrison should not be privatized because the path to profit is to treat human beings badly.Prisons are based on two things custody and care.No one wants to cut corners on the custodyaspects of a prison. Care is the only part of a budget that has room to be cut. "One way for-profitprisons to minimize costs are by skimping on provisions, including food. “ A psychiatrist whoinvestigated a privately run prison in Mississippi found that the inmates were severely underfedand looked “almost emaciated.” During their incarceration, prisoners lost anywhere from 10 to60 pounds." Citation Steven StarkeyAdditionally, there is a financial incentive to do a bad job. The more effective acorrectional facility is, the less need of its services.If the inmates have educational, work releaseprograms, medical care such as anger management or mental health while locked up its lesslikely for them to return to a prison after being released. There will never be a point of notneeding prisons; if there is better correctional policies and administration could result in a

Privatized prisons are disastrous from the point of view of a profitorganization.Finally, the most important reason Prison should not be privatized is the right to punishbelongs only to the state. The criminal justice system is the process by which legally deprivehuman beings of their guaranteed rights. When someone other than the state tries to deprivesomeone of these freedoms and rights, charge them with crimes so if it is a privatized prisondoing no different than one that committed the crime.
Prisons should not be privatized because punishing criminal activity should not be a "forprofit" business. It is not the place of private prisons to administer prisoner punishments becauseit is the State government that determine who is a prisoner and they should remain responsiblefor them until time has been served.Private prisons that cut costs may risk security problemsbecause cutting costs often means cutting corners which is lessWhy the government should not privatize prisonsStudent nameInstitutional AffiliationDateThe government should not privatize prisons because punishing criminal activities shouldnot be considered a profitable business. Private prisons should not be given the mandate ofadministering punishment to criminals. The government or the states can decide on how to
SHOULD NOT PRIVATIZE PRISONShandle the convicts until they get fully rehabilitated (Burkhardt, 2019). Therefore, it is wrong toallow private prisons to take charge of prison operations because their major aim is to makemoney and not rehabilitate convicts. Private prisons may be drawn to cutting their costs whilehandling convicts; this would create problems as they will dodge the convicts' right path.The government should not privatize prisons because their interest in making a profitwould mean treating convicts badly. It is worth noting that prisons are majorly based on twothings: custody and care, and no person would want to take a shortcut on the custody aspects ofprison. One way in which private prisons would try to minimize their costs would be by savingon key provisions such as food, medication and other basic needs (Burkhardt, 2019). Apsychiatrist who once carried out a study in a privately run prison in Mississippi established thatconvicts were severely starving and appeared 'almost emaciated'. During their detention, theinmates lost approximately ten to sixty poundsAdditionally, there is a financial incentive for doing bad work; if a correctional facilitydoes effective work, the government will not require their services. If the convicts have aneducational background, work release programs, and medical care such as anger management ormental health while in prison, it would be not easy for them to get back to prison after theirdischarge (Montes et al., 2019). Therefore, there would be no need to require prisons; bettercorrectional policies and administration would reduce the need.Conclusively, the major reason why the government should not privatize is that the rightto punish convicts entirely belongs to the state. The criminal justice system has the obligation ofdenying people their guaranteed when caught on the wrong side of the law. When someone otherthan the criminal justice system tries to do this, they should be charged, and this is the samecrime that the privatized prisons would commit.

SHOULD NOT PRIVATIZE PRISONSDeliverable 05: Collaboration on the Final Draft of a Persuasive Essay:Please answer the following short questions as if you are offering feedback and input--in about25 word answers--to your work colleague as a form of solid feedback about this paper.Yoursentences should be complete and answer the prompt in light of what you are reading beforeyou.1)I, the reader, feel the topic of this paper is stated quite plainly and a clear position istaken on it because (why or why not?):I, the reader, feel the topic of this paper is stated quite plainly, and a clear position is taken onit because it was not effectively developed throughout the writing process. The topic sentencewas not quite elaborate, and the paragraphs did not produce significant arguments and alogical flow of the topic sentence.

I, the reader thinks that this paper lacks sufficient justification regarding the topic on privatization of prisons. The essay also contained several incomplete sentences which disrupts my ability to fully comprehend the topic. In addition, the structure of the essay lacks cohesiveness and coherence.  

Upon reading the persuasive essay, there have been numerous errors observed particularly on grammar, sentence structure, as well as maintaining coherence and cohesiveness. A persuasive essay is meant for the reader's to be fully convinced with one's take on a certain topic. A person's justification must be clearly stated in a way that is concise yet comprehensive enough for the reader's to completely understand the topic. Poor construction of essay of such type does not fully serve its purpose- that is to convince the readers. 

2)Name 2 elements of the writing process you think this author needed to considermore thoroughly in stating his/her position.The first element of the writing process that the author ought to have considered whilestating their position was to make an invention (pre-writing), organization, and then finally towrite the paper, revising the written essay, and editing it.Second, the author ought to have expanded on the evidence to help the paragraphs flowlogically from the main topic sentence. This would allow the paragraphs to remain morefocused, and everything would be related to the central idea expressed in the topic sentence.

The author should have started by considering the responsibilities of private companies in jail management before taking a position and providing rationales for why prisons should not be closed down. Second, the author may have offered a high-level review of the criminal justice system's processes and the modifications that would be required to make it more efficient and effective.

I did my best answering your question. I hope it helps. If you still have a question, you may ask it in the comment section. Thank you and have a good day. 

3)Did you find the research element to be covered sufficiently in this persuasiveresearch essay?Why or Why Not?The author effectively covered some of the research elements; however, they did not considersome of the critical aspects of the research. For example, the topic sentence was notsatisfactorily stated, and there were also feeble explanations on why the government shouldnot privatize prisons.
