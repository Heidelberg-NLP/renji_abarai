You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Text: Can A Felon Vote? - What States can you vote with a Felony?

Can A Felon Vote? – Felon voting rights by state

After serving their sentence, felons discover multiple limitations imposed on them. Each offense implies its own limitations, but a common restriction among all felonies is felony disenfranchisement, that is, the suspension of voting rights.

Disenfranchisement is widely used across the United States, though how exactly it is used vastly varies from state to state. And as a felon who has recently finished their sentence, you may be wondering: can a felon vote?

There isn’t a single answer to this question since policies vary from state to state, as we already mentioned. So we’ll try to provide you with information on felon voting right policies for each state.

What is felony disenfranchisement?

felon voting

Felony disenfranchisement is the restriction of an individual’s voting rights due to a conviction in a felony. Felonies are offenses that are punished by incarceration of more than 1 year or/and a fine over $1000.

Felony disenfranchisement is one of the collateral consequences of a conviction. Disenfranchisement is common for felons across the United States. And since the United States is among the most punitive countries in the world when it comes to felonies, its limitations are more restrictive than in many other countries around the world.

In fact, to give you some perspective, here are figures of felony disenfranchisement as of 2016:

* As of 2016, there were 6,1 million Americans disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. This number has risen dramatically over the years. There were around 1,17 million disenfranchised individuals in 1976, 3,34 million in 1996, and 5,85 million in 2010.

* 1 in 40 adults, or the US voting age population’s 2.5% is disenfranchised due to a current or past felony conviction.

* In the 12 states(as of 2016)that disenfranchise people after the sentence, disenfranchised individuals account for over 50% of the US’s entire disenfranchised population.

* Disenfranchisement rates vary vastly across states due to variations in legislation. For example, Florida accounts for 27%of the whole disenfranchised population of the US.

* 1 in 13 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised. Over 7,4% of the adult African American population of the US is disenfranchised. For the non-African American population, the share is just 1,8%. In four states – Kentucky (26%), Virginia (22%), Florida (21%), and Tennessee (21%) –more than 1 in 5 African Americans are disenfranchised.

At the same time,certain states have repealed or amended disenfranchisement laws in recent years, allowing 840 thousand American citizens to regain their voting rights.

Opinions on felony disenfranchisement vary significantly among experts and the general public. Both proponents and opponents have valid points on the issue, which we will examine a little bit later.

With all that being said, felons may restore their voting rights, but the restoration process varies widely across states. Some states only restore voting rights based on individual petitions, while others don’t restrict voting rights at all, even in prison. Now, let’s find out how voting rights restoration policies vary from state to state.

Felons who are no longer serving a sentence and have been unconditionally discharged from supervision by the Department of Corrections may vote in Alaska. The Alaska Division of Elections requires proof of unconditional discharge from the supervising entity.

Those convicted in crimes involving moral turpitude, as well as individuals on probation or parole for the same crime are ineligible to vote in Alaska.

In Arizona, first-time, single-felony offenders receive automatic vote right restoration upon the completion of the sentence and payment of all fines. Two-time or more offenders would need to apply for the restoration of their voting rights with their county.
