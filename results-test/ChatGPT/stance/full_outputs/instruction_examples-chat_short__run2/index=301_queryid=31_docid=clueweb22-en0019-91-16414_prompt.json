Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Abstract

Obesity is a medical disease that is increasing significantly nowadays. Worldwide obesity prevalence doubled since 1980. Obese patients are at great risk for complications with physical and psychological burdens, thus affecting their quality of life. Obesity is well known to have higher risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, musculoskeletal diseases and shorter life expectancy. In addition, obesity has a great impact on surgical diseases, and elective surgeries in comparison to general population. There is higher risk for wound infection, longer operative time, poorer outcome, and others. The higher the BMI (body mass index), the higher the risk for these complications. This literature review illustrates the prevalence of obesity as a diseases and complications of obesity in general as well as, in a surgical point of view, general surgery perioperative risks and complications among obese patients. It will review the evidence-based updates in these headlines.

1. Introduction

Obesity is a medical disease that is increasing significantly nowadays. It is classically defined as a body mass index ≥30 kg/m2. Almost all healthcare professionals are exposed to obese patients because of their higher risk for morbidity and mortality, and surgeons are not exceptions [1

].

Obesity and its severity can be measured by several methods [2

]. They include the following.(a)Body mass index (BMI) [1]: this is the most common method to measure obesity in adults (see Table 1(a)) and children (see Table 1(b)).(b)Skin fold thickness [2] (biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac): it measures the subcutaneous fat to determine the percentage of body fat.(c)Waist circumference [2]: it is a common method to measure the risk of cardiometabolic affection (see Table 2).(d)Waist-to-hip ratio [2]: it examines fat distribution and it is used less frequently.(e)Waist-to-height ratio [3]: waist-to-height ratio is a better screening tool than waist circumference and BMI for adult cardiometabolic risk factors in both sexes (see Table 3).

2. Prevalence of Obesity

2.1. Worldwide

Worldwide obesity prevalence doubled since 1980 [4

]. In 2010, approximately 1.0 billion adults are overweight, and a further 475 million are obese [5]. It was also estimated in 2010 that up to 200 million school-aged children are either overweight or obese; of those, 40–50 million are classified as obese [5, 6].

2.2. Regional (Saudi Arabia)

In 2005, the estimated overall obesity prevalence in Saudi Arabia was 35.5% [7

]. In 2010, Saudi Arabia was ranked at the 11th place for obesity worldwide, with obese men making 26.4% and obese women making 44% among general Saudi population [8]. From a collected data in 2004 and 2005 from Saudi children, the overall prevalence of overweight was 21% and 13.4% and obesity was 9.3% [9].

3. Risk of General Diseases Associated with Obesity

3.1. Mortality

Overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths [4

]. It was thought that mortality rates from noncardiovascular diseases were inversely related to BMI [10]. But now obesity is highly associated with overall mortality among adults [1114] (as well as in children [15]). The higher the BMI, the higher the risk. The high mortality rate is mainly due to vascular diseases [16] and cancers [17]. In addition, weight fluctuation is associated with higher risk of overall mortality [18].

3.2. Diabetes Mellitus

Obesity is highly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus at all ages [19

21]. Increase in the BMI [20] and waist circumference [21] increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus; this is because of the common association between obesity and metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [22].

3.3. Hypertension

As the prevalence of obesity increases, the prevalence of arterial hypertension increases as well [23

, 24]. Generalized [23, 24] and central obesity [25] increase the risk of arterial hypertension. Since high blood pressure and impaired glucose tolerance are frequently associated with obesity, it has been suggested that hyperinsulinemia could represent one of the pathogenic connection between obesity and arterial hypertension [26]. Age, race, and sex may alter the frequency of hypertension in obese patients [27].

3.4. Dyslipidemia

Obesity has strong association with atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [28

], while central obesity is associated with a triad of high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [29].

3.5. Heart Diseases

Obesity is considered a risk factor for multiple heart diseases like coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Despite the old debate to consider obesity as a risk factor of coronary artery disease [30

], this relation is confirmed by higher BMI [31] and higher waist circumference [32], but waist-to-hip ratio can replace the BMI and waist circumference in being a better predictor of coronary artery disease [33]. It is more prevalent in females as compared to males [34]. Surprisingly, obesity is associated with more favorable short-term outcomes after acute coronary syndrome [35]. Obesity has a strange association with heart failure that is called obesity paradox (as well as other diseases). It can result in systolic and diastolic dysfunction [36]; on the other hand, obese patients with heart failure have better clinical outcomes in comparison to patients with normal BMI [37, 38]. Obesity (regarding high BMI and waist circumference) has also higher risk for atrial fibrillation incidence, recurrence, and poor prognosis [39]. Obstructive sleep apnea [40] and pericardial fat [41, 42] that are commonly associated with obesity are considered significant underlying mechanisms for heart failure and atrial fibrillation.

3.6. Central Nervous System Diseases

Obesity has a negative impact on vascular (e.g., stroke) [43

] and nonvascular diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) [44]. In 2009, BMI was thought to be not significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis [45], but it is now considered as the greatest risk factor for intima-media thickening of carotid artery and therefore predisposing to ischemic stroke [46]. BMI was a risk factor for total and ischemic stroke in men and women; however, abdominal adiposity was a risk factor for total and ischemic stroke only in men [47] (hemorrhagic stroke is not related to obesity [48]). In addition, obesity might result in executive and cognitive dysfunction, with other associated risk factors [43, 49].

3.7. Respiratory Diseases

Obesity is a risk factor for several respiratory diseases like obstructive sleep apnea [50

] and bronchial asthma [51]. Obesity plays a major role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea (high BMI, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, central neural mechanisms, neck circumference, etc.) [52, 53], its severity [54], and negatively affecting in the quality of life [55]. Obesity also has a significant impact on bronchial asthma risk, severity, and control [51]. It is a risk factor for airway hyperresponsiveness [56] but not airway inflammation [57].

3.8. Gastrointestinal Diseases

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of esophageal disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma [58

]. Severity and duration of reflux symptoms [59] as well as Barrett esophagus [60] are related to high BMI, high waist circumference, and high waist-to-hip ratio, and this relation was not found before [61]. The risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is also increased with high BMI [62] and high waist circumference [63].

3.9. Kidney Diseases

Obesity is related to a variety of kidney diseases, including glomerulomegaly, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease [64

]. It is found that obesity is highly prevalent among renal transplant recipients [65]. As with obesity-survival paradox, it is associated with improved survival in hemodialysis patients [66].

3.10. Osteoarthritis

Obesity is a primary risk factor for the development [67

] and progression [68] of knee, hip (recently involved [69]), and hand osteoarthritis. This is due to the biomechanical and metabolic effects of obesity on joints [67].

3.11. Gynecological and Obstetric Complications

Overweight and obesity increase the overall risk of pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal complications [70
