Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

No one wants to cut corners on the custodyaspects of a prison. Care is the only part of a budget that has room to be cut. "One way for-profitprisons to minimize costs is by skimping on provisions, including food. “ A psychiatrist whoinvestigated a privately run prison in Mississippi found that the inmates were severely underfedand looked “almost emaciated.” During their incarceration, prisoners lost anywhere from 10 to60 pounds."

If the inmates have educational, work releaseprograms, medical care such as anger management or mental health while locked up its lesslikely for them to return to a prison after being released.

1)I, the reader, feel the topic of this paper is stated quite plainly and a clear position istaken on it because (why or why not?):
I do not feel this because a lot of times the point is hard to understand in this essay, the thesisis lost many times throughout the paper and the evidence is not there.

I, the reader thinks that this paper lacks sufficient justification regarding the topic on privatization of prisons. The essay also contained several incomplete sentences which disrupts my ability to fully comprehend the topic. In addition, the structure of the essay lacks cohesiveness and coherence.

Poor construction of essay of such type does not fully serve its purpose- that is to convince the readers. 

2)Name 2 elements of the writing process you think this author needed to considermore thoroughly in stating his/her position.
I believe the author should have considered the evidence and the structure elements ofthe writing process more while stating their position. Fixing these things wouldimprovethe essay and make it much easier to understand.

The author should have started by considering the responsibilities of private companies in jail management before taking a position and providing rationales for why prisons should not be closed down. Second, the author may have offered a high-level review of the criminal justice system's processes and the modifications that would be required to make it more efficient and effective.

After reading the persuasive research essay, I may conclude that the research elements are not adequately used and covered in this essay.

4)Consider the sentence structures here. Do they demonstrate the writer’s criticalthinking ability in this exercise? Why or Why Not?No, the author tended to use many simple sentences over and over they could have used a fewcompound or complex or compound complex sentences to demonstrate their thinking abilitymore clearly.

The correct answer 

Sentence structure refers to the grammatical arrangement of a sentence. Your writing's sentence structure comprises the placement of nouns and verbs within each phrase.

Due to multiple incomplete sentences, capitalization problems, and comma issues, the sentence constructions do not exhibit the critical thinking of the writer ability in this task. Several phrases were likewise left unfinished, without periods.
