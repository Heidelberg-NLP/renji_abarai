Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

That's what you probably drank when you're a baby. Milk for humans come from female human breasts. This is called breast feeding.

It's unnatural and not needed at all to drink milk from other animals. This includes cows milk.

All mammals produce milk in their milk glands to only feed their new borns. Not for any other reason.

Its pretty normal, and the best milk, which is produced by a human mammal. No milk can be the alternate to breastmilk as its produced by human female and the breastmilk contains the best properties as needed to human body. The characteristics of all other milks are according to the need of specific mammals and can be harmful for human beings in longer run.

Even it can be consumed by adults and have same benefits . A woman has the tendancy to produce enough milk for her own family and keep them healthy by protecting from illness due to increased immunity through her breastmilk.

Everyone drinks human milk as a baby and I think many husbands have had a taste. It‚Äôs very sweet like the milk from a bowl of sugary cereal. Most of the sugar is lactose which is intended to nourish the baby.

But I recently learned that a good percentage of the sugar is ‚ÄúHMO‚Äù or Human Milk Oligosaccharides, which babies and husbands can‚Äôt digest. These are aimed at the various ‚Äúgood‚Äù microorganisms in the gut flora, which aid in digestion and keep the baby healthy.

Of course these are missing from cows‚Äô milk, but I think some ‚Äúformula‚Äù milks have them.

Well, of course. Human milk is made for humans to drink. If you‚Äôd feed it to your precious babies, why couldn‚Äôt you drink it yourself? I have, ‚Äòstraight from the tap‚Äô as it were, and it tastes like fresh warm creamy milk. Which is what it is. That was very stimulating to the provider of the milk, too.

Tell him no. If you can‚Äôt stand up to him, leave.

YES!!!! Ask her. You won‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs ok with it unless you ask her. Hold off on doing it after she has the baby for the first 6 weeks so baby can get all the colostrum. But before and after those weeks, yes!

On a scale of effectiveness for most women if simply breast pumping with little or no pre massage has a "value" of 1 actual nursing frequently everyday with pre massage is 3-5X more effective, self suckling if this is comfortably possible is about 2-4X better while pre massage, hand expressing is 1.5- 2X more effective and even pumping after pre massage is about 1.5. And a partner nursing will more effectively both stimulate and remove breast milk 2-3X more effectively than any other method as well as generally being considered more comfortable and pleasurable for her.

When it comes to trying breast feeding your husband, you need to make sure that he is latching on properly to your nipple. If he doesn't do it properly, even if your breasts are full of milk, it simply won't come out, or there won't be as much coming out as there could be. Your man should put his mouth around the entire nipple area, and take as much breast in his mouth as possible. He should move his tongue and mouth to try and suck the milk from your milk ducts. He won't need to suck hard, but with patience. If he keeps sucking and using his tongue, this should aid milk supply. You might need to keep practicing this with him to ensure he has the right latch.

Good Luck and enjoy this together!

A single cow can produce about 8 gallons of milk per day, and it only takes a handful of farmers to care for hundreds of cattle.

Now imagine what it would take to get 8 gallons, per day, of human milk. It would be a logistical nightmare, not even accounting for the necessary treatment of the women involved as if they were livestock and not people.

Babies should drink the milk of their species, be that calves drinking cow milk, piglets drinking sows milk, kittens drinking cat milk, or human babies drinking mother‚Äôs milk. Human babies need a lot less milk than calves, meaning that women who produc

Human babies need a lot less milk than calves, meaning that women who produce sufficient milk for their children do not have sufficient excess capacity to feed adults or weaned children as well.

I have breastfed 3 children. Their fathers all tried my milk. Out of curiosity, yes. But also, well I had requested it each time when I was engorged and could not get the pump to work out of frustration when my ‚Äúletdown‚Äù wasn‚Äôt triggering easily. I had seen Infant ICU nurses, local Midwives, and even a Lactation Consultant who suggested massage, using cold cabbage leaves to alleviate the pain and pressure, trying different positions with the baby and so forth‚Ä¶ What worked so much faster and better than all of these methods was my partner gently caressing my nipple, working at it with his mouth

I had seen Infant ICU nurses, local Midwives, and even a Lactation Consultant who suggested massage, using cold cabbage leaves to alleviate the pain and pressure, trying different positions with the baby and so forth‚Ä¶ What worked so much faster and better than all of these methods was my partner gently caressing my nipple, working at it with his mouth until the milk flowed properly. I recall having to do this at least twice when the child was not with me and I was supposed to pump, when I was on the verge of breaking the damn machine due to it‚Äôs inefficiency‚Äî I was in terrible pain!

So there I was, my hubby on my tit, closing my eyes, massaging the hardened ducks which felt clogged with an overabundance of milk, letting down and getting a good flow in less than a minute each time‚Ä¶ Now, we agreed he didn‚Äôt have to keep drinking however; My thought is that the milk should be kept for the baby. If I was drinking alcohol (out on a date, say) it was expressed this way in the restroom and then tossed. I must add that I never did these things when the baby was under 3 months old because hind-milk has more of the wonderful component called Colostrum in it which Daddy surely doesn‚Äôt need.

Now, I‚Äôm not sure if it was the fact we had done something new together, the idea of helping me out when I was in pain, or the taboo topic of Adult Breastmilk Feeding, or what exactly made it such a turn-on, but I can assure you that these men and myself, all normal adults for the most part I would say, can all attest to it being a rather lovely experience as a couple. The one guy and I had sex after I emptied my breasts sufficiently. On another occasion my guy asked me to spray my breastmilk on his face and mouth during intercourse, and I have to admit that was amazing for me as a woman!

Upon sharing this story with other men, and all my mother friends too, I found that A LOT of men seem to have done this once or twice. It‚Äôs helpful and also super sexy for a nursing Mother if she trusts her man enough to let down her guard just a little‚Ä¶

I didn't drink my wifes breast milk because it tasted good. My wife's milk tasted great. It was more of a turn on for me. i miss it greatly and my wife misses it too.
