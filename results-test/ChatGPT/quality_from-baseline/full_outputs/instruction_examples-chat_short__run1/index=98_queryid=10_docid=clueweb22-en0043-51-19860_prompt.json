Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should We Mandate COVID Vaccines for Children?

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine in New York City.

New York City has just announced that it wants to impose a very tough mandate for vaccination, using employers to insist that everybody be vaccinated. This policy is one that is, I think, tougher than anywhere I know of in the country. Germany, Austria, Italy, and other countries are moving toward vaccine mandates, partly out of fear of new variants appearing that might be more infective to people, and perhaps people who are only partially vaccinated might still get sick — a worry that places like New York City couldn't take another shutdown.

So it’s going to be vaccination. So mandates seem smart to me. I have been strong in arguing that the city should require every city worker to get vaccinated—police, fire, prison guards, social workers, government bureaucrats. They should all, as a condition of employment, need to get vaccinated and it’s controversial.

Mandates, it seems to me, are what you do when persuasion isn't working but you have the threat of new variants and still thousands dying every week from COVID-19. You have to take steps that are tough and you have to take steps that get results even if — and I'm well aware — there are plenty of people in the US and many states who hate the idea of the government forcing vaccination on anyone.

All that said, what about kids? What about those kids under 12 years of age? Should they be part of mandates in New York City? Would I be arguing that we have to mandate vaccination for kids? No, and here's why. Those approvals have been emergency use authorization. Parents are nervous if they worry that they're not fully tested and licensed before they give something to a child.

I'm well aware that public health people say that there's not a big risk of long-term effects from vaccination, and I even understand the science that tells me why. The elements, if you will, of the vaccine get eliminated from the body quickly enough that we have to start talking about repeated shots, so that's not a long-term risk.

Nevertheless, that's not what parents hear when it comes to kids, babies, or infants. They worry whether the experts really know what they're saying. Can I trust this? I don't want to alienate parents from getting their kids vaccinated. Should we try to persuade them? Urge them? Yes. COVID-19 is still a threat to kids. There are still kids dying from COVID or getting long-haul COVID-19, and it's a big enough risk that it's right there with tetanus, measles, mumps, and many other infectious diseases as something we want to try to prevent. It's right there in terms of saying we have safe vaccines that are not risk-free but are almost risk-free.

Until the evidence is accumulated to say this is licensed, whether it's initial vaccines or so-called booster shots, I'm not going to push parents past their comfort zone. I think parents want to protect their kids above everything else and I respect that ethic. They don't want to get into fights all around the country, with some parents saying, "You're going to do something based on incomplete or not full evidence before licensure, telling me I have to mandate vaccination for my kid." I don't think that's worth that battle.

Once licensed, should COVID-19 join the list of vaccines that we ask school kids to get? Yes, because school is one place where transmission happens, and school is a place that we want to keep open. Do we need more testing and masking to go along with vaccination? Sure, but that's a fight that's down the road.

Right now, let's urge parents to do the right thing and try to convince parents to do the right thing. I don't think it is the time to tell parents, "If you want to send your kids to school, it's a mandate. If you want to send your kid to do things in the city, it's a mandate." I think it's premature and will result in unnecessary resistance.
