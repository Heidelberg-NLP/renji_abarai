The writer presents a well-structured argument, provides evidence to support their claims, and uses persuasive language to convince the audience.\n\nFor the second speech on whether athletes should be allowed to use steroids, the rhetorical argument quality is also high. The writer presents a clear argument against the use of steroids, reinforces their point with examples, uses strong language to convey their message, and effectively appeals to the audience's sense of ethics and fair play."
