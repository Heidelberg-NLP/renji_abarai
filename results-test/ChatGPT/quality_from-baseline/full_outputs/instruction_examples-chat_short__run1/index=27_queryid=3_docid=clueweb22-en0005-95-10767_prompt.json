Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Federal investigators are examining some well-timed trades made by golf champ Phil Mickelson and golf course owner and Las Vegas gambler William T. Walters. Authorities say the two men made big, around the time activist investor Carl Icahn launched hostile takeover bids for the company. No charges have been filed, and Icahn asserts that his record is "unblemished."

As Wall Street keeps its eyes on this investigation, here are some other insider trading cases that made headlines.

Rajaratnam was found guilty on 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud charges on May 11, 2011. The jury convicted him of nine counts of securities fraud and five counts of conspiracy for what prosecutors describe as the money manager's central role in the most sweeping probe of insider trading at hedge funds on record.

Former Goldman Sachs executive was also convicted for supplying Rajaratnam with many of the tips that eventually took the Galleon manager down.

Steven A. Cohen ran one of the most admired hedge funds in the world, garnering some of the highest returns (and highest fees) in the industry until its spectacular fall from grace.

In 2010, federal agents raided the offices of two hedge funds founded by SAC Capital Advisors alumni, and later arrested several top traders at SAC, including Michael Steinberg and Matthew Martoma. Cohen was not charged, but SAC Capital itself pleaded guilty in November to fraud charges and agreed to pay $1.8 billion to settle charges that it allowed insider trading for more than a decade. Steinberg and Martoma are among those convicted.

Golf buddies

Scott London (pictured at left), a senior partner at KPMG, had a habit of talking about work over dinner and golf with an old buddy. He later discovered his friend was making trades based on their banter, and began accepting cash gifts and Rolex watches in exchange for further tips. In total, London received about $70,000 in gifts before the SEC found them out. His friend Bryan Shaw pulled in roughly $1.3 million.

"I nearly threw up," London said of hearing just how much Shaw had profited from the scam. "I was led to believe the number was far less, closer to $200,000."

London in April to 14 months in prison and a $100,000 fine. Shaw pleaded guilty to insider trading charges as well.
