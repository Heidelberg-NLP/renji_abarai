Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Can I Buy Over-the-Counter Birth Control Pills?

There are several birth control options that you can buy over-the-counter (OTC), but birth control pills are not one of them. The only available OTC birth control pills are for emergency contraception.

You need a healthcare provider's prescription to get birth control pills, which come as either progestin-only pills, combination pills, or extended-cycle pills.

How to Get Birth Control Pills

In order to get a prescription for birth control pills, you will need to talk to your healthcare provider about your medical history and get your blood pressure checked. Your practitioner may also require you to have a pelvic exam and a breast exam, but this is not a universal requirement.

Why Aren't There Over-the-Counter Birth Control Pills?

There is a lot of debate on this topic, and there are many reasons why the pill isn't available OTC, as well as many potential benefits if they were available OTC.

Pros of OTC Availability

Proponents of OTC availability argue that menstruation and preventing pregnancy are not diseases. Furthermore, the birth control pill is not a dangerous medicine, and most of the pill's side effects are not very serious. There isn't a risk of addiction and they don't give you a high.

In fact, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports over-the-counter access to hormonal contraception without age restrictions.1

Requiring medical exams in order to get the pill could be difficult for people who work long hours and are not able to take time off. Some people might want a degree of anonymity when using the pill, and might not want it listed in their health records.

Pros of Prescription-Only Availability

Some people should not use the pill due to health risks, so it is important that you see a healthcare provider when you're using the pill. And some healthcare providers argue that if people could get over-the-counter birth control pills, they would never come in for their yearly wellness exams.

With several different hormone combinations, you might switch from one to another, and you would benefit substantially from having a doctor guide this process.

Furthermore, the pills can cause some side effects and complications and can interact with certain OTC and prescription medications, so having a doctor to manage these issues can be safer for you.

Having a doctor's prescription is often a prerequisite for health insurance coverage, so getting the birth control as a prescription can reduce your out-of-pocket cost.

Guidelines on How to Get the Pill

General medical guidelines and research suggest that hormonal contraception (like the pill) can be safely prescribed based on a careful medical history and blood pressure measurement.1

Some people should not take the pill. It can increase your blood pressure, so you should have your blood pressure checked regularly for the first few months after you start using the pill. It can also increase the risk of blood clots for some people, especially smokers or people who have a medical condition that causes blood clotting abnormalities.

Breast exams, pelvic exams, Pap smears, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screenings are important for detecting and preventing cancer and for family planning and reproductive health care. Even though these tests may be uncomfortable (and are not something most people look forward to), they are an important part of your overall health care.

Routine STI screenings are recommended because people who use birth control pills are less likely to use internal or external condoms that protect against these infections.

These exams are essential for early detection of many diseases—some of which can be life-threatening. That being said, the information that healthcare providers get from these exams does not indicate whether a person can or cannot safely use birth control pills.

Requesting a Pill Prescription Without a Pelvic Exam

You may be like many other people out there—you want to use the pill, but you are not seeking a prescription because you're afraid to have a pelvic exam and Pap smear. If that's the case, you should know that research shows that birth control pills can be safely prescribed based on a careful review of your medical history and blood pressure measurement.2 For most people, no further exams are necessary.

Current guidelines created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that birth control pills can be safely prescribed without a pelvic exam.

If your healthcare provider insists that you must have a breast exam, pelvic exam, Pap test, or STI screening in order to give you your pill prescription, explain your concerns and/or fears, and request not to have these exams done. They might hesitate out of concern that you could have an undiagnosed medical issue if you don't have these screening tests, or they might agree to prescribe the pill for you without the screening tests.

You can also call around and find a different medical professional who does not require these tests as a prerequisite for prescribing birth control pills. Planned Parenthood may be an option that doesn't require a pelvic exam to get hormonal birth control.

A Word From Verywell

The pill is an effective, discreet, and convenient birth control method. It allows you to have control over your fertility, to manage your period, and to prevent pregnancy, and its use probably results in fewer ​abortions.3

Consider your birth control options and choose the one that will work best for you. But don't avoid seeing your healthcare provider to get your routine gynecologic checks. This is also a chance to discuss your options with your medical professional privately and get a prescription if that is what you decide is best.
