It also states that sex industry exists due to demand, and regulating it could eliminate further black markets and protect women.\n\nOverall, the article presents several arguments and reasons to support its point of view of legalizing prostitution. However, one should carefully analyze the facts and opinions presented in the article and consider various social, ethical, and moral implications related to the topic."
