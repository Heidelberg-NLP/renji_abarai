Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is Cell Phone Tower Radiation Harmful? – Get The Facts!

Is Cell Phone Tower Radiation Harmful? – Get The Facts!

Cell phone towerCell Phone towers emit mass amounts of Radio Frequency (RF) Radiation also known as “microwave” radiation. If you have ever seen the huge size and quantity of power cables that run these towers you know that the amperage they use is significant as well.

Cell phone tower radiation is very harmful. It disrupts your body’s own EMFs, causing many kinds of health problems such as headaches, memory loss, cardiovascular stress, low sperm count, birth defects and various types of cancer. There are literally hundreds of peer reviewed scientific studies by non-biased scientists from all around the world that show these harmful health problems. 

And the studies found that the closer people live to these cell towers, the higher amounts of these medical conditions occurred. Because of this scientists from all around the world are writing letters to their governments calling for a halt to the roll-out of the new 5G technology. 5G frequencies don’t travel as far and so they are estimating that cities will need a “mini” cell tower every 2 to 8 houses.

Testing A Cell Tower’s RF Radiation

In the below video I test the radiation coming from a huge cell tower standing right next to an office building. I am standing right next to the building and the amount of radiation they are being exposed to is tremendous. The video is short, but definitely worth watching. You will be surprised by the massive amount of radiation this cell tower is emitting.

(Before we get into the rest of this article I just want to mention two things. First, there is a way to protect yourself from this radiation. The science behind it is the same they use to neutralize and clean up chemical and radioactive waste sites. You can check it out here “Aulterra EMF Neutralizer Products Review“.

And second, many people that come to this site are also interested in emergency preparedness. If you are interested in this subject you might want to check out the website EmergencyPrepGuy.com. It has really good information on all types of emergency preparation.)

What Is Cell Tower Radiation?

Cellular-Tower-TopAs was mentioned earlier cell tower radiation is a radio wave from the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is part of the “non-ionizing” portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Anything “wireless” or “WiFi”, such as cell phones, baby monitors and wifi routers all emit this same kind of radiation.

And according to Kevin Mottus of the US Brain Tumor Association, within this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, the higher the frequency, the more dangerous the radiation is.

Cell Tower Radiation Science

Albert EinsteinMany who financially benefit from this technology (or their political agendas/campaigns do), as well as those who have not read all of the scientific studies on the topic, claim that non-ionizing radiation is not harmful because it does not “heat”. But that is not the only way radiation causes harm.

I think it is interesting that whenever you read any articles on this topic that either comes from government or the technology industry (or the main stream media sources that support them), they either down play the scientific studies, or out and out lie and say that they don’t exist. I have had websites such as the New York Times write articles about my site, link to it, but still blatantly misrepresent the facts beyond belief.

However whenever you read articles by sources independent of those two groups, especially independent scientific sources, then you get the real truth. So I know honest people who are willing to put in the work to research, know the truth.

There is more science on this subject showing negative health effects than one can possibly talk about. I challenge any of you who are curious and willing to put in the work to go to the scientific studies page of this website (linked above) and do the research for yourself. That is what I did and this website grew out of all of that research.

Media Articles On Cell Phone Tower Radiation

In an article by Blake Snow of Fox News he does an interesting article called “Are Cellphone Towers Hazardous to Your Health?”  I am going to quote most of the article here because it illustrates a major point that I want to make.  I will quote the article and then make the point immediately after.  Following is the article:

Living near a cellphone tower might eventually melt your brain, give you cancer or worse, neuter your reproductive organs — at least that’s the warning issued last week by a group of trade activists.

“People who live near cell towers and antennas are in jeopardy,” Dr. Robin Bernhoft, president of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine, told FoxNews.com.

In an attempt to encourage citizens to write Congress and ask the FCC to update “obsolete” regulations of radio frequency radiation emitted by cellphones, Bernhoft’s colleague Whitney Seymour of activist website Citizens for Health added, “FCC standards for cell transmission antennas were based on earlier studies created almost 20 years ago using even older data.”

“The substantive evidence of harm from wireless radiation is overwhelming,” he added.

Not exactly, said Jack Rowley of GSMA, the largest association of cellphone providers in the world.

This is a minority and alarmist view based on a selective reading of the scientific evidence,” Rowley told FoxNews.com. “In the last 10 years, more than 30 expert health groups have reviewed the research and consistently concluded that there are no established health risks from using phones or living near antennas.”

The scientific evidence seems to side with the cellphone providers.

For example, a recent study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives concluded that, “Although there remains some uncertainty, the trend in the accumulating evidence is increasingly against the hypothesis that mobile phone use can cause brain tumors in adults.”

What about the respected World Health Organization’s research on cancer, which recently classified radio frequency radiation as a “possible carcinogen”?

Rowley says it was based on limited data for specific types of brain tumors — and even the WHO admitted that further research is needed.

“The evidence was even weaker for a possible risk from towers,” Rowley added, “with typical exposure levels thousands of times below safety standards and comparable to TV and radio. More importantly, the latest WHO fact sheet recognizes the standardization work, which is the origin of the FCC regulations.”

The U.S. Wireless Association (simply called the CTIA) also refutes minority alarmists with more reputable science.

A statement on the trade group’s consumer awareness website summarizes the current science: “Leading global health authorities, such as the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have reviewed this research or have conducted their own, and have found that the available scientific evidence does not show that the use of wireless phones is associated with any health problems, including cancer.”

The Interphone project, coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, is the largest study of cellphone use and brain tumors ever undertaken and included substantial numbers of subjects using cellphones for 10 years or longer.

Even that massive, long-term study wasn’t conclusive, however; researchers noted ultimately that “an increased risk of brain cancer is not established from the data from Interphone.” The group noted, however, that some areas for further observations among those with the highest usage rate — but they hardly said to put the phone down.

When asked by FoxNews.com for additional details on potential health risks of cellphones, the CTIA deferred to the above research.

Of course, both the GSMA and CTIA exist to protect the interests of for-profit cellphone companies. And research to track the long-term health effects of cellphones is in no way final. In fact, it’s ongoing.

Study Results Vary Depending On Who Pays For Study

Okay now what is my point?  You will see this over and over.  Their are “thousands” of studies on both sides of this safety argument.  The ones put out by government agencies or that are paid for by the technology industry all say that it is all safe and everything is fine.

But all of the truly independent studies, those not by government agencies nor paid for by industry all say that the RF or Microwave radiation put out by cell towers, cell phones, and other wifi or cordless technologies are not safe at all.  In fact they say that they are very dangerous.

Now I had to delete several of the links in that Fox News article because the article was written in 2011 and many of the links did not work any longer.  But I left the ones that still work.  But here is my point.  If you click on the link “consumer awareness website” from their article it takes you to a industry run website “cellphonehealthfacts.com”.  They blatantly lie on this website.

For example if you click on their frequently asked questions menu option on the website, and then click on “learn more” it takes you to their frequently asked questions on safety.  In there it says “Are cell phone base stations and towers safe?

Radiofrequency energy (RF) from antennas used by cell phones result in exposure levels on the ground that are typically thousands of times below safety limits set by the FCC. These safety standards include significant extra margins of safety for tower workers and the public.
