Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Determining How Many Rounds to Carry Concealed Everyday

A common misconception for new concealed carriers is that a smaller gun is always the better option. While there are some advantages of carrying a smaller gun, micro-compact single-stack handguns have some significant limitations. Diminished capacity is one drawback. So how small is too small, or rather how many rounds should you carry?

P365 With SIG 365 V-Crown Ammo

The old cliche “if you can’t do it in 6, you can’t do it at all” is just that, a cliche that does not necessarily represent the most current information on how best to approach self-defense.

Contrast that with this statement from Massad Ayoob prefacing his research into the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies’ switch from 5-6 round revolvers to 15-18 or 20 round semi-automatics;

5-6 rounds was usually enough… but usually isn’t always

I don’t usually carry a gun.

I always carry a gun. I carry a gun that I trust will always work. Not a gun that usually works, or I  hope it will work.

What does it mean to have a reliable everyday carry (EDC) handgun?

I choose to carry a firearm with as much capacity as I can comfortably accommodate and at least one additional magazine. I alternate between the HK P30L and the FNX 45 Tactical and an extra magazine or two.

Counting rounds in this video is tricky, but I approach it in this manner, the bad guy has 40 rounds in his AK47. So, count off the first 37 rounds and attribute those to the criminal.

Then start the counting over and attribute all the remaining rounds to the officer, and I ask the question, “how many rounds does this guy take before he is no longer a threat to those officers?”

The two police officers fire a total of 54 rounds.  Is the bad guy still a threat when he is on his knees trying to lift the gun and put more rounds downrange? Absolutely.

By my count, he takes about 30 rounds of the 54 total that officers fire before he is not a threat. The remaining rounds fired as the assailant lays on his side are likely because the officer is terrified for his life. He and his partner are injured and cannot afford to allow this guy to get back up and finish that 40 round mag.

I want to mention that there is a difference between the “typical” law enforcement self-defense shooting and the “typical” shooting a citizen defender finds themselves in. However, I choose to determine my load based on how the human body reacts to gunshot wounds rather than solely on the specific mission.

You Train A Lot, and so Every Shot is going to “Count,” Right?

Self-Defense Accuracy StatsOne of the biggest mistakes we make is to think we will replicate the same speed, accuracy, and fluidity during a deadly attack as we do on the range.

Dave Grossman, in his book “On Combat,” discusses many of the physiological and psychological pitfalls naturally programmed into our bodies. Some of the side effects of being in a deadly force situation include; loss of bowel and bladder control, tunnel vision or fog of war, loss of fine motor control, auditory exclusion, loss of depth perception, and more.

In life or death situations that happen at lightning speed and come with debilitating physical reactions from our bodies, we cannot expect to target every one of our shots perfectly.

In fact, according to several studies about police and law enforcement shootings conducted by the NYPD, the LAPD, and FBI, we find that the percentage of rounds fired that hit the threat, on average less than 20%.

To do some quick math, 20% of 8 is 1.6, so if in a gunfight you are better than average because you train weekly or bi-weekly and you carry 8 rounds in your gun, you can expect to be in slide lock and have only put 2 good, effective hits into the target.

Apply this to the above video. Out of the 54 shots fired by the officers, it’s possible only 10 of the rounds actually hit the assailant. The actual number of gunshot wounds the assailant in the video suffered is unknown.

So then, if 5-6 shots were “usually enough but not always,” we would need 25-32 rounds on our person. This number accounts for the average number of missed shots in typical gunfights while still getting the 5-6 good hits prescribed in the cliche.

Having Less Capacity is Ok if You Have a Larger Caliber, Right?

stopping power of defensive handgun rounds

Well, he had to use so many rounds because he was using a 9mm. If he was carrying a .45 he could have gotten it done in less rounds

I have created this table using Hornady’s ballistic chart PDF available on their website. Therefore this is only looking at the rounds that Hornady manufactures and their energy in foot-pounds at the muzzle.

Because most defensive shootings occur between 5 and 21 feet, the foot-pound measurement at 50yds is negligible.

Foot pounds is an energy measurement for the amount of work an object can do. For example, 1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to move a 1 pound object one foot off the ground at a certain altitude.  We use JHP or jacketed hollow point rounds in our EDC gun because the “work” destroys vital organs, which effectively stops the attacker by disrupting the connection where the brain tells the finger to pull the trigger.

We want the round to penetrate the assailant, to transfer all of its energy into the target doing as much damage as possible in the form of expanding the projectile, creating heat energy, and transitioning raw, violent force to the vital organs.  Foot-pounds are not the “end all be all” way to discuss the lethality of a particular round. Still, it remains our most scientific way to discuss something that inherently combines many different factors that are all needed to stop an assailant effectively.

However, at a most basic level, we can use this to see what capacity each of these rounds has to do “work.”

The 9mm averages around 332-foot pounds, where the .40 S&W and the .45 ACP average around 409 foot-pounds. For a real difference of 77-foot pounds or about ¾ the energy in a .22.

Many states have laws defining minimum foot-pounds needed in a projectile to humanely (effectively) take a deer or an Elk. Most have pinned that number around 1,000-foot-pounds. So to stop a strong, healthy 150-pound animal requires at least 1,000-foot-pounds of energy. And we know that even still, many of these animals can run and evade or survive after being shot, even if the shot damages vital organs.

If your 150lb animal is another human bent on killing you, the scary fact is that alone, none of these handgun rounds has even half that capacity to do work.

Assuming that all factors remain the same and we switch out the officer’s 9mm for .45ACP, a compelling case cannot be made for the .45 ACP doing a substantially better job at stopping this bad guy faster. So we can make a case that .45 ACP might do a better job some of the time but not ALL of the time.

Indeed, it cannot do 2x or 3x the damage of the other rounds as it is so often reported.

That still leaves us with the issue that a handgun capable of holding 15/18 rounds of  9, .40, or .45 even still wasn’t enough to stop this guy. At 1:10, we hear the officer do a magazine change and then empty his second magazine into the attacker to stop him eventually.

I think too often we think, “well, if I need a second magazine, then I must be in a much worse situation than is reasonable to anticipate.” EJ Owens talks about this in his video about whether to carry a round in the chamber or not. He says something like, “If I need an extra magazine, then that guy is REALLY in trouble.”

Again, to me, this video illustrates the point that having an extra magazine and needing to reload in the middle of a gunfight is a little more prevalent of a concern than maybe we are all willing to confront mentally. Even though the vast majority of citizen defensive gun uses don’t involve magazine changes, it is scary to think you would have to reload in the middle of a gunfight.

When was the last time you practiced a tactical reload? Did you move to cover, or were you standing in a lane at a gun range? If we don’t develop the necessary skills, they won’t be there on demand.

Don’t Forget the Physiology of being stopped by gunshots

In a deadly force situation, your objective is to stop the threat as quickly as possible.

Shoot to kill, shoot to maim, shoot to injure does not exist in real life.

Hollywood has led many of us to believe in the essence of a “kill shot” or one-shot kill. It is portrayed as a clean, sanitized ‘easy’ thing to do with one bullet—the Villain and the Hero circle each other with guns drawn, well-aimed, and fingers on triggers.  The hero shoots, and the other dramatically dies in a few seconds, gripping and pointing their gun, gasping for breath, a look of shock on their face, and for some unknown reason, the inability to squeeze the trigger on their still aimed gun and respond to the hero…  Roll Credits.

The truth is that one or three well-placed shots are unlikely to immediately stop the threat because of the way the brain, the nervous system, and the muscles work. For example, the brain can continue to tell the finger to squeeze that trigger up to 2-3 minutes after the heart and lungs have been damaged due to several shots to center mass and no longer pump blood to the brain.

We either need to cause MASSIVE trauma like the officer in the video did by putting shot after shot into the assailant. The assailant’s body eventually shut down and gave up in around 1 minute.

Or we shoot a target area that is difficult to hit (ocular occipital), and hopefully, we are just really super accurate. Or we find a place to hide while we wait for the bad guy to succumb to their injuries.
