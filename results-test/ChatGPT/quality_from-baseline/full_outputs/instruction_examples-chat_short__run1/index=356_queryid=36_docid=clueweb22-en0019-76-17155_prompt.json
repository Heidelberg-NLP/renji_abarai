Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Golf a Lifelong Sport

Golf a Lifelong Sport

RelationshipsGolf is a lifelong sport you can play into your 90’s. So, why should you consider taking up the sport? First, it is a great way to stay active and strengthen your core.  Whether you are looking to remain active, build relationships or just have a good time, there are many health and mental benefits to playing the game of golf.  And, did I mention you don’t have play like a pro to benefit from the sport?  Here’s just a few of the reasons to make golf your lifelong sport of choice.

 

Benefits of Golf as a Lifelong Sport

Exercise – Although you might be tempted to take a golf cart, if you do decide to walk the course and carry your bag or use a pull cart, you could cover 4 to 8 miles during the round.  That translates to 9,200 to 18,400 steps!

Build New and Existing Friendships – Golf is more than a sport.  It is a great way to networking on the golf courseget together with friends.  Enjoy a round of golf and then head to the 19th hole for a refreshing beverage and food.

Family Connections – If your whole family plays the game, it’s a great way to get 2-4 hours of together time with your significant other and children.  What a better way to spend the day then on a golf course with those that are closest to you.

Networking – Golf is a great opportunity to network and strengthen relationships with clients.

Improve your Health – Walking has been shown to have a positive effect on cholesterol, body composition and metabolism, according to a review in the British Journal of Medicine.

Enhance your Mental Health – If you are able to hit a very small ball, then you are forced to concentrate which may help improve your problem-solving abilities.

Paradise Coast:

Naples is known as the golf capital of the world.  You may be surprised to learn there are more than 150 golf courses throughout southwest Florida. What better place to buy a second home, relocate or retire if you are a golfer?

Begin Your Own Naples Property Search:

So, if you’re ready to begin your property search, I encourage you to explore my website to find information about communities in Naples, Bonita Springs, Estero or Ft. Myers.  If golf is your game, I specialize in golf community real estate and would be happy to help you navigate the more than 100 different golf communities in our area.  If you prefer a more direct approach, I will provide a list of properties that meet your criteria and/or communities that meet your needs.

Bottom Line:

If you are buying a home in a golf community, you will find it is more complex than a normal home purchase.  As you can probably imagine, there are significant differences between golf courses.  Also, there are hidden fees, different membership fees, pet restrictions and very different demographics in each community.

Or, if you are considering new construction, remember the contractor’s real estate agent represents the builder’s best interest, not yours.  There is no cost to you to have an agent represent you. In fact, I can help you save money and negotiate for extras which the builder may not let you know about.

So, if you are looking for information about a specific community in Bonita Springs, Estero or Naples, contact me and I will prepare a custom market report for you.  Most importantly, I can provide the market information and insights to help make sure you select your dream home.

Lastly, I will handle all of the contract negotiations for your property from the first offer to close.
