Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

This chapter presents a sample of the arguments used by the opponents of strong federal gun control to support their position since the 1990s. Chapter 9 provides arguments put forward by supporters of strong federal gun control.

STATEMENT OF SENATOR KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON (1943, R-TX), ON WASHINGTON, D.C., GUN BAN CASE BEFORE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, MARCH 18, 2008

Today's oral arguments were a major step forward in the case that for the first time gives the Supreme Court a clear opportunity to establish the second amendment right as one of an individual to protect themselves in their home with possession of a gun. I was pleased to submit an amicus curiae brief to the Supreme Court with the most signatures of members of Congress ever obtained for a brief to the court. Our amicus brief, signed by 54 Senators, the Vice President and 250 members of the House of Representatives firmly stated that every congressional act has assumed this second amendment to be one for individuals, not an organized militia. It is my hope that the Supreme Court will settle this clearly so that there will be no further attempts by gun control advocates to undermine this important right established by our Founding Fathers.

SPEECH BY SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (1936, R-AZ), AT THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA's CELEBRATION OF AMERICAN VALUES CONFERENCE, WASHINGTON, D.C., SEPTEMBER 21, 2007

For more than two decades, I've opposed the efforts of the anti-gun crowd to ban guns, ban ammunition, ban magazines, and paint gun owners as some kind of fringe group, dangerous in modern America. Some even call you extremists. My friends, gun owners are not extremists, you are the core of modern America. The Second Amendment is unique in the world and at the core of our constitutional freedoms. It guarantees an INDIVIDUAL right to keep and bear arms. To argue anything else is to reject the clear meaning of our founding fathers.

But the clear meaning of the Second Amendment has not stopped those who want to punish firearms ownersand those who make and sell firearmsfor the actions of criminals. It seems like every time there is a particularly violent crime, the anti-gun crowd comes up with a plan to capitalize on tragedy and limit Second Amendment rights for all Americans. I opposed the ban on so-called assault weapons which was first proposed after a California schoolyard shooting. I thought it made no sense to ban a class of firearms based on cosmetic features. I opposed waiting periods for gun purchases. We lost on both of those in the short run, but it has worked out better in the long-run. Fortunately, that gun ban sunsetted after 10 long years. And, I was proud to vote against those who tried to extend it in 2004.

I also opposed efforts to cripple our firearms manufacturers by making them liable for the acts of violent criminals. This was a particularly devious effort to use lawsuits to bankrupt our great gun manufacturers. A number of big-city mayors decided it was more important to blame the manufacturers of a legal product than it was to control crime in their own cities. Fortunately, we are able to protect manufacturers from these frivolous lawsuits.

In my years in Washington, I have seen what I will call three myths used by politicians to excuse their support for gun control. First, is the big city myth: that it is acceptableeven necessaryto fight crime in big cities. If you have a crime problem, they say it's really a gun problem. So instead of increasing police patrols, instituting tough sentences for lawbreakers and other measures that would actually address crime, we restrict ownership of guns and limit the rights of law abiding citizens.

We are meeting today in a city that represents the worst of this myth. The citizens of the nation's capital do

not enjoy the right to keep and bear arms. That is why I have co-sponsored legislation repealing the ban on firearms possession for law abiding citizens in the District of Colombia. The Second Amendment is not just for rural Arizona, it is for all of America.

The second myth is that of the bad gun. This was at the core of the debate over so-called assault weapons. Proponents of this myth argue that some kinds of guns are acceptablefor nowbut others are not if they have certain featureslike a pistol grip or an extended magazine. I will continue to oppose those who want to ration the Second Amendment based on their views of what guns it applies to.

Finally, there is the hunting mythif you show your bona fides by hunting ducks or varmints or quail, it makes up for support for gun control. This myth overlooks a fundamental truth: the Second Amendment is not about hunting, it is about freedom.

Let's be clear. If [the Democratic candidates] are elected President, they will go after the rights of law abiding gun ownersjust as Bill Clinton did when he was president. MoveOn.org, which seems to be calling the shots in the Democratic Party these days, will have more influence on gun control in the Oval Office, not John Dingell. These Democratic candidates voted to ban guns or ban ammunition or to allow gun makers to be sued out of existence as Senators. Think how much worse it would be if they had the power to appoint Supreme Court Justices, name Attorneys General and use the full power of the federal government.

TESTIMONY OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY (1942, R-GA), ON H.R. 1384, FIREARMS COMMERCE MODERNIZATION ACT, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SUBCOMMITTEE ON CRIME, TERRORISM, AND HOMELAND SECURITY, MAY 3, 2006

Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support of my bill, H.R. 1384, the Firearms Commerce Modernization Act.

I introduced this legislation after I learned about some of the severe and, quite frankly, obsolete restrictions that Federal law imposes on businesses and individuals who want to sell firearms legally through our Nation's interstate economy.

In general, since 1968, it has been illegal for any person without a Federal firearms license to buy or sell handguns across State lines. Licensed dealers cannot sell firearms, except certain collectibles, at a gun show outside of their own State.

Even between dealers, who go through a thorough background check to get a dealer's license, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives does not allow face-to-face transfers. So dealers who agree on a sale must go back to their stores and ship the firearm.

Gun theft is a major source of the firearms used in crime, and it is senseless under current law to make a licensed dealer ship a firearm when they can make a legal and documented transaction at the time of purchase.

My bill would do three simple things, Mr. Chairman. Firstly, it would make it legal for a licensed dealer to sell a handgun to a resident of another State as long as they do the sale in person, and they obey the laws of both States as well as Federal law.

And secondly, it would allow dealers to do business at out-of-State gun shows. Again, they would have to obey the laws of the State they were visitingthis addresses Ranking Member Scott's concernsas well as all the Federal laws and regulations they normally obey.

It would allow, thirdly, dealers to transfer firearms directly to one another, instead of risking theft or loss during shipment.

The reason we can make these changes today is really quite simple. It's based on technology. These restrictions were imposed in 1968, when the only way for a dealer to conduct a background check on an out-of-State buyer was by sending a certified letter to the police in the buyer's home State, waiting for a reply, and then waiting a week before making the sale. That was 1968 technology.

But today, dealers can request background checks with a phone call or online by either contacting the FBI directly or by contacting a State police agency that uses the FBI's database. They get an answer in seconds and with an exceptional degree of accuracy. This routine applies one way or another to every gun sold by every dealer in every State.
