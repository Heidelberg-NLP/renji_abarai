Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is There a Constitutional Right to Concealed Carry?

October 28, 2021

On November 3, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in New York State Rifle in Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen. The case was brought by two men who were denied New York concealed carry permits, along with New York’s National Rifle Association affiliate, against the superintendent of the New York State Police, Kevin Bruen. The lawsuit challenges a provision of New York’s law regarding concealed carry permits—which allow owners to carry guns in public in a concealed manner—requiring anyone who does not automatically qualify for a permit (including some state judges, correctional facilities employees, and others) to show that they have “proper cause” for the permit in order to receive one.

On this week’s episode, host Jeffrey Rosen is joined by two legal scholars who filed briefs on opposing sides of the case—Judge J. Michael Luttig who filed in support of Bruen and David Kopel who filed in support of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association. They detail the arguments they made in their briefs as well as what’s at stake in this case, and debate how to interpret the text, history, and meaning of the Second Amendment in light of whether the Court should uphold the New York law.

TRANSCRIPT

This transcript may not be in its final form, accuracy may vary, and it may be updated or revised in the future.

 [00:00:00] Jeffrey Rosen: Hello, friends. I'm Jeffrey Rosen, President and CEO of the National Constitution Center, and welcome to We the People, a weekly show of constitutional debate. The National Constitution Center is a nonpartisan nonprofit, chartered by Congress to increase awareness and understanding of the Constitution among the American people. On November 3rd, the Supreme Court will hear the Second Amendment case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association versus Bruen. The question in the case is whether states can deny people the right to conceal carry a weapon outside the home. On today's episode, I'm thrilled to be joined by two of America's leading commentators on the Second Amendment, who have written important briefs on opposite sides of the case.

David B. Kopel submitted a brief in support of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association. He is research director at the Independence Institute, an adjunct scholar with the Cato Institute and an adjunct professor of constitutional law at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. He's the author of the forthcoming case book, Firearms Law and the Second Amendment, and was part of the team that argued the landmark Second Amendment case, District of Columbia versus Heller. David, it is wonderful to have you on the show.

[00:01:18] David B. Kopel: Thank you very much for having me. It's the, the whole program, the Constitution Center does is, is very good for for civic virtue and the continuation of our constitutional republic.

[00:01:29] Jeffrey Rosen: And Judge J. Michael Luttig wrote a brief in support of Kevin Bruen, Superintendent of the New York State Police. He is currently counselor and special advisor at the Coca Cola Company. He was previously judge on the United States Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, a great friend of the Constitution Center who is celebrating his 40th wedding anniversary this week with his wife Elizabeth. Judge, it is wonderful to have you back on the show, and happy anniversary to you and Elizabeth.

[00:02:02] Judge J. Michael Luttig: Thank you, Jeff Rosen. I sincerely appreciate the well wishes. It's a pleasure to be with you and, and the National Constitution Center always. It's a special pleasure to be here today with Professor Kopel.

[00:02:14] Jeffrey Rosen: Well, let's begin with the New York State statute and the stakes in the case. David, the New York statute authorizes local official to issue unrestricted license to carry loaded handguns on a showing of proper cause. Seven other states have statutes like New York, requiring the showing of particular need to carry a handgun in public. Tell us about the New York law and those seven other states and what the stakes are in this case.

[00:02:40] David B. Kopel: Sure. So as you say, the norm in the United States, and in 42 states, and in the District of Columbia, yeah, and, and in some of our territories as, as well, is that if you want to carry a firearm for protection lawfully, in many states you don't need a permit and in many other states you do need a permit, and the statute specifies fair objective reasons for people to qualify for the permit. For example, you might have to go through a biometric fingerprint based background check and also pass a safety training class.

There are three states that nominally have on the books statutes for issuing the carry permits, but in practice, virtually nobody ever gets a permit. That's the situation in Hawaii, where only security guards on duty get permits. In Maryland and New Jersey, you basically have to prove an imminent specific death threat in order to get a permit, and in five other states including New York, some of the jurisdictions in those areas issue fairly to qualified proper trained background checked adults, but some of them are very arbitrary and say, "You can't exercise your right to, to bear arms unless we decide you have a good enough need such as specific criminal threats or maybe you're a diamond merchant carrying your wares." things like that. So that really negates the Second Amendment, because the Second Amendment right belongs to the people as a whole, and just as the government can't say, "Oh, you don't really need to keep a gun in your home for protection.", the government can't likewise say that only a tiny subset of the people can be able to bear a, an arm for lawful protection.

[00:04:30] Jeffrey Rosen: Judge, you have written that the eight states that require a showing of particular need to carry a handgun in public are not the only laws that would be rendered unconstitutional if the court rules against the New York law. You note that many other jurisdictions, in fact most of them restrict carrying handguns in many public places, including schools, parks and public transit, and these laws too could fall if gun advocates prevail in Bruen. Tell us more about those other laws that might be vulnerable and, and your view of the stakes in this case.

[00:05:01] David B. Kopel: Yes Jeff, that's correct. You know as Professor Kopel explained, there are seven to eight states that have proper cause requirements for a, a license to carry a firearm in public. There are a host of other states who have what are called multiple location restrictions on the public carry of, of firearms. So for instance in those states, variously they, they may prohibit public carry and on the public streets, in public buildings, in schools, in homes of worship, houses of worship, in businesses, theaters, concert halls sporting events and the like. But all told, today, across America, there are, there are many, many restrictions on the public carry of, of firearms. And depending upon the, the, the court's ruling and, and the scope of, of that ruling, most, most of those laws would, would would subsequently be held unconstitutional.
