Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

How to Get Your Private Student Debt Discharged via Filing for Bankruptcy

In 2019, is it still possible to get rid of your private student loan debt by filing for bankruptcy? Yes, but it’s so difficult to actually qualify for one that I honestly feel bad in even making it seem like a possibility.

While it’s true that there has literally never been a better time to attempt to discharge your private loans via Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings, it’s still something that’s only going to work for a tiny percentage of people (like 1 in 1,000, at best).

Why is it so hard to get a bankruptcy discharge for private loans? Because the approval requires proving, in court, that your student loan debt is causing an “undue hardship” on your life, meaning that it’s making it difficult for you to afford basic necessities (like food, housing, medical care, etc.).

Anyone who lives a normal standard of living in the United States, even who isn’t buying a new phone each year, taking vacations, having an occasional Starbucks coffee or spending money on anything other than food, shelter and medical care, probably won’t end up being approved for the discharge.

Even if you’re making less than the poverty line, on food stamps and welfare, and have a good-sized family, you probably STILL won’t be approved for a bankruptcy discharge.

With that said, this Guide goes through the process of how to get a private student loan bankruptcy discharge anyway, talking about the differences between filing via Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, explaining exactly what an “undue hardship” is, and offering advice on how to improve the chances that your bankruptcy discharge application is approved.


But Before I Go Through All Those Details…

Please take my word that it is probably NOT worth your time to pursue a bankruptcy discharge, because it’s so extremely difficult to qualify for that the odds are terribly low that this strategy will provide you any sort of debt relief whatsoever.

Instead, what you should do is call my partners at McCarthy Law PLC; a group of attorneys who specialize in dealing with PRIVATE Student Loans. They're the only company who can significantly reduce your private debt and lower your monthly payments, no matter how much you may owe or how long you've been in default.

How do they do it? First, they negotiate with your lender to settle your private debt for around 40% of whatever you currently owe by promising that you'll pay off the entire settled amount in a single, lump-sum payment.

Don't have 40% sitting around in cash? Don't worry! They'll get you a new loan for the amount your lender settles on, allowing you to pay off the settled loan in its entirety, restoring your credit, and reducing your monthly payments.

McCarthy Law is the only company I trust to help my readers with Private Student Loans, but please DO NOT CALL them if you only have Federal loans, because they won't be able to help.

To get McCarthy's help with your Private Student Loans, call them at 1-877-317-0455.


What Bankruptcy Laws Have Changed Recently?

Recent years have seen several large court cases settled favorably for the person attempting to discharge their student loan debt, but remember, “several” out of millions doesn’t mean that pursuing the discharge is actually a good idea.

The increased number of bankruptcy discharge approvals have set a precedent that made it far more likely for future cases to get approved, meaning that you have a better shot at getting your loans discharged than you would have in years past, but the odds are still extremely low.

On the bright side, there are many signs that things are headed in the right direction for people with excessive student loans, and it is possible that we may end up getting some bankruptcy reform at some point in the near future, since everybody’s talking about how big a problem the student loan crisis is, and I’m starting to hear media and even Congressional speculation on why it remains so difficult to use bankruptcies to eliminate private student debt.

Even though the odds of receiving a bankruptcy discharge approval remain quite low, I still want to cover all the technical details of the process of applying for one, because if even ONE of my readers manages to get the discharge, I’m sure that it will turn their entire financial life around.



Can You File Bankruptcy on Private Student Loans?

Yes, you absolutely can.

In fact, it’s never been easier to file bankruptcy on private student loan debt, and the bankruptcy process is literally the only way I know of that allows you to get your private loans entirely forgiven (discharged, wiped out, erased), without having to pay a single cent for them.

Winning a private student loan discharge does require going to court, however, and it is almost certainly going to require the assistance of an attorney, so make sure to keep that in mind and to consider the costs of hiring a lawyer to help you with bankruptcy proceedings if you’re truly thinking of going this direction.

Honestly, I advise friends and family to try other alternatives first, especially Private Student Loan Consolidations & Refinancing Programs, because these programs are way more likely to work out in their favor.

How Does Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Work?

During the bankruptcy process, you’ll need to issue a formal complaint arguing that your student loan debt is placing an “undue hardship” on your life, preventing you from being able to provide basic life needs for yourself and/or your dependents.

It’s tough to receive an undue hardship discharge for certain types of private students loans – in some cases, it’s impossible. But there are really rare cases where this may be possible, so let’s talk about how to make that happen.

The difficulty in proving an “undue hardship” is determined by the type of school you attended, the specific school where you received your education, the type of educational program you borrowed money to attend, and your specific financial situation that you’re currently facing.

It’s that last element that’s most important, because to get approved for the discharge you have to be able to prove that your loans are making it difficult for you to afford basic necessities, thereby essentially threatening your ability to survive.



Loans that are Easy (Easier) to Discharge

Here are the types of private student loans that are typically easiest to discharge via filing for bankruptcy:

  • Private student loans taken out to attend a school that is not on the Department of Education’s list of “eligible educational institutions” (explained below in the section called “Am I Likely to Receive Approval for Discharge?”)
  • Private student loans that were provided by large, national lenders, like well-known banks or other massive financial institutions
  • Private student loans that are being serviced by Navient, who was recently sued by the Federal Government for all sorts of nefarious activity, leading to the creation of the Navient Student Loan Forgiveness Program.
  • Private student loans that were issued for education that isn’t offered at traditional four year colleges and universities, such as technical training programs, vocational training programs, truck driving schools, IT training courses, coaching classes, mechanic schools, cooking schools and beauty schools

Keep in mind too that even if you don’t qualify for a full discharge, you may end up being eligible for having some percentage of your private student loan debt erased during bankruptcy proceedings.

This is way more likely than acquiring the full discharge, but it’s still a strategy with a very low percentage of success, so don’t do it unless you think you’ve got a slam dunk case.


How to Get Your Loans Discharged

Getting your private student loans discharged during bankruptcy proceedings doesn’t happen automatically, as it’s not a part of the basic or normal bankruptcy process.

To receive a discharge for your debt, you’ll need to file a petition (called an “adversary proceeding”) that requests a court judgment (called a “determination”) on whether or not you will receive approval for having your private student loan debt discharged.

After filing the petition, you’ll have to prove to the court that paying off your loan “will impose an undue hardship on your and your dependents.

The basic idea here is that the court has to agree that your loans are destroying your life by making it virtually impossible for you to provide food, shelter and other basic needs for yourself and/or your family.

This isn’t an easy to thing to do, even if your loans really are causing you serious financial hardship, especially because different courts use different “tests” to determine whether or not you’re truly facing an “undue hardship”.



Which Undue Hardship Test Will You Face?

I can’t answer that question with any shred of accuracy, and to get an accurate answer, I’d recommend that you consult with a local bankruptcy attorney.

Courts in different parts of the country use different tests, but it appears to be up to the judge’s discretion (at least in some cases) on how this stuff is handled.

And to add to the confusion, some courts take the test as an all or nothing deal where you either qualify for having your entire loan discharged or fail to qualify for having any of it discharged, while others will allow you to discharge some portion of your loan depending on the results of the test.

However, to help give you an idea of what you’ll be facing when trying to get approval for an undue hardship discharge, here’s a breakdown of the most common undue hardship tests in use today:



The Brunner Test

The Brunner test for undue hardship allows you to discharge student loans in bankruptcy proceedings if, and only if, you meet all three of the following conditions:
