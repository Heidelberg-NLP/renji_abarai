Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

In 2020 the United States administration put forward its peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Called by some “The Deal of the Century,” the plan provides, in part, for: Israel to annex about 30% of the West Bank; the opportunity for Palestinians to establish a state in the remaining areas of the West Bank and Gaza, with some additional lands adjacent to Gaza that Israel will cede to them; and a package of grants and loans to help kick-start the Palestinian economy. From what you know about the plan, is your attitude favorable or unfavorable? (Zogby Research, June 24-July 5, 2020)

Imagine that Israel and the Palestinians return to negotiations that try to achieve an agreement that ends the conflict. Imagine that these negotiations result in a final status agreement between the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority that includes the following details:
• Both sides declare an official end to hostilities and violent conflict.
• A demilitarized Palestinian state alongside Israel, based on the
1967 border with some land swaps that allow most Jewish settlers to
remain in Israel.
• A Palestinian capital in the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.

“The coalition agreement signed between Likud and Blue and White says that after a discussion between Netanyahu and Gantz, a plan coordinated with the United States for applying sovereignty to parts of the West Bank/Judea and Samaria will be brought for the government’s and/or the Knesset’s approval.
