        "content": "The debated topic is whether high school students have too much homework. The pros include that homework improves student achievement, reinforces learning, and teaches time management skills. The cons include that it can be harmful, disadvantages low-income students, and there is a lack of evidence that homework helps younger children. Additional arguments against homework include that it discourages creative endeavors, encourages sedentary lifestyles, and is often too time-consuming for students to develop important life skills. On the other hand, arguments for homework suggest that it allows parents to be involved with their child's learning, reduces screen time, and creates better communication networks. However, research suggests that excessive homework can lead to student stress, lack of sleep, and an inability to focus in school. Arguments for homework suggest that it is a form of self-regulated learning, with students taking responsibility for managing their own behavior and academic progress. Ultimately, the debate centers around finding a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of homework in terms of student achievement, academic progress, and overall well-being. \n\nWorks Cited:\n- Bembenutty, H.
