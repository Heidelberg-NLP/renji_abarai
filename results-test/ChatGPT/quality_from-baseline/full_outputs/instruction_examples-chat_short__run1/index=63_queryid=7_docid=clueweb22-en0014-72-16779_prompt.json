Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Are Felons Allowed to Vote in Texas?

Are Felons Allowed to Vote in Texas?

The right to vote is something Texas residents and other U.S. citizens take pride in because they have the power to make their voices heard and participate in our democracy. With the midterms coming up and the presidential election only two years away, millions of Americans have registered to exercise this right.

However, can felons vote in Texas? While it is generally assumed that felons are prohibited from voting, that is not always the case.

Felons cannot register to vote if they obtain a final conviction Texas. However, a felon who has successfully completed his/her sentence—which includes their period of confinement, term of probation, term of parole, or has obtained a pardon—can register to vote.

If a felon’s conviction is on appeal or has obtained a deferred adjudication, he/she can still vote. Additionally, if an individual is merely prosecuted or indicted for a felony, he/she can still vote.

Keep in mind, ex-felons must re-register to vote, instead of simply showing up at the polls. They can request an official, postage-paid voting application, or download an informal application, from the Secretary of State’s website. It is possible to register to vote when renewing or applying for a Texas driver’s license.

Once the registration is complete, they can mail it to their designated County Voter Registrar or turn it in by hand to the same office. The office should receive the application 30 days before the scheduled election to obtain eligibility to vote. A voter registration certificate will then be mailed within 30 days.

To determine if a felon is eligible to vote, the Texas Department of Public Safety sends information which lists individuals who have a final conviction to the Secretary of State’s office each week. The information is then compared to the data of all registered voters. When matches occur, the results are sent to the specific counties of those individuals. The counties will then send these individuals a written notice of investigation, which they must respond within 30 days or be removed from registration.

Felons who are not eligible to vote but do so anyway could face criminal penalties.
