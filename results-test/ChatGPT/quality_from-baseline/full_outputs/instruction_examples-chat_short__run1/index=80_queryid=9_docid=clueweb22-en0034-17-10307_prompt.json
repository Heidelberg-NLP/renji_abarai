Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?

I read the article “Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?  I was about a debate between two sides.  The pro school uniforms and against school uniforms.  The pro school uniforms say, “School uniforms make schools safer for students. They say that uniforms create a “level playing field.” Students who wear uniforms are less worried about who has the nicest clothes. So they pay more attention to their schoolwork.”  Against school uniforms say, “Kids express themselves through their clothes. They argue that making them wear uniforms limits this freedom. They also say that uniforms don’t make students behave better or do better in school. Uniforms don’t hide the differences between rich and poor students, they argue. In fact, uniforms actually make them worse.”  Which side would you be on?  I think that I would be on against school uniforms.  I think that school uniforms ruin the fun of expressing yourself through clothes.  I am noticing how some children get in trouble just because they refuse to wear the school uniform.  I think that is unfair.  All they want to do is wear their own clothes and they get in trouble.  What do you think about this situation and how do you think people could solve it?

  1. Great Job 🙂 I think kids should not wear uniforms. I used to wear a uniform in kindergarten at my old school. It was not fun.

  4. well I think school uniforms are necessary for the students because they’ll look more smarter in school uniforms and it’s shows identity to the schools as well.
