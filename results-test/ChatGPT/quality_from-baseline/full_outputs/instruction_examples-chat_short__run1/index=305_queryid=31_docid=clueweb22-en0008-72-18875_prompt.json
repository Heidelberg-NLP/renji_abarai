Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Comments & Discussion

Boston University moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation. Abusive, profane, self-promotional, misleading, incoherent or off-topic comments will be rejected. Moderators are staffed during regular business hours (EST) and can only accept comments written in English. Statistics or facts must include a citation or a link to the citation.

There are 26 comments on Is Obesity a Disease?

  1. Excellent and balanced article . By rhe way -what is obesity and what is dis- eaae? Is it a chronic relapsing condition or a continuum/spectrum similar to alcohol and drug use disorders abd addiction with genetic bio- psycho-social and environmental determinants? Clarity and agreement on the meaning and mechanisns of obesity would be most helpful to begin to address social stigma and to protect the health of the public against extremes we often see today in self punishing dieting on the one hand and compulsive stress reducing comfort eating on the other. We can learn from the long standing debate on to what extent is unhealthy alcohol and drug use a dis- ease.

  2. This is ridiculous. Obesity should be considered part of a disease if someone has a thyroid problem that they cannot control or some debilitating disease which limits their ability to process food, exercise and/or diet correctly. Frankly, this is a way of making parents feel better because they let their fat children sit around and watch tv all day instead of sending them out for exercise.

    I have family who are fat and who literally sit around and feel sorry for themselves. They do not have a medical condition, other than type II diabetes. They also eat excessively and do not exercise.

    I feel awful for those who, because of some underlying medical condition, cannot lose or gain weight. But we as a society cannot apologize for the other fat people who will take this as justification for being lazy.

    In a time where medical expenses are high, we can’t afford to inflate our medical costs by inventing diseases, when we can fight other diseases which may help people with their weight.

    1. I agree with this. I mean I have the utmost sympathy for people who aren’t happy with themselves but it seems to create this notion that problems are “disorders” and can be solved by a pill or surgery. It’s not impossible to lose weight, albeit very difficult, especially when someone is obese, but hiding behind the defense of an illness is a bit of a cop out. Virtually everyone on earth has some sort of difficulty, and putting a blind eye to the fact that we are both sedentary and unhealthy is a bad thing.

      It isn’t fair to feel contempt for obese people, but certainly just accommodating obesity by making larger seats sends the wrong message. The predisposition to weight gain is certainly genetic in some ways, but one often isn’t born obese, they become so by way of their lifestyle. We need a cultural shift in America which puts an end to pill-popping as shortcuts.

    2. I’m an individual who has been challenged with the disease of obesity. I don’t hide behind it’s label just as I don’t hide behind the labels of heart disease, etc… I also don’t hide behind the label of obesity as a condition for folks that choose those semantics… Or, the label of heart condition.

      I firmly believe that genetic, social, environmental, & psychological factors can influence the disease. Furthermore, reliable treatment options are available. I’m no longer obese because through very hard work I fought the disease with psychotherapy for Binge Eating Disorder, gastric bypass surgery, mindful eating habits & exercise with a personal trainer.

      Many folks believe that gastric bypass is the easy way out. Ha! That’s ignorance. The surgery is one tool in the disease management process. One still must eat mindfully and exercise to manage the disease. Additionally, gastric bypass is the best option for successful and long-term treatment (see Cleveland Clinic).

      Am I cured? No! I will be required to eat mindfully, exercise, continue psychotherapy for the rest of my life. If I do not do so? The disease will rear its ugly head. I won’t allow it to control me. I’ve come too far to do otherwise.

      For folks who want to keep the semantically argument going… have at it! It means very little to my success to argue! The teeter-totter of the argument will only convince those on either side of it. For me, I recognized it was a disease in my life and did something about it!

  3. I was listening to the radio yesterday and heard talk show hosts debating this news. An announcer made a point to say on air, “don’t go buy the large bag of Doritos and instead buy a bag of vegetables. It’s as easy as that”. But it’s not as easy as that. Some poor neighborhoods without healthy foods (aka Food Deserts) do not have access to vegetables and healthy alternatives to a ‘Large Dorito Bag’. It’s hard for those in good neighbors to imagine those in impoverished areas, and we take even buying a bag of vegetables for granted. Although I agree, there are Americans who choose to not exercise and to eat bags on bags of Doritos, but let’s not forget those who can’t help it. This new classification will help those in poor neighborhoods (which is great) but it’s going to take much much more but this is the first step. So well done AMA!

    1. I do not necessarily agree that in areas of poverty people cannot afford vegetables. There was a time when I had to be on food stamps and was very careful with what I bought. When I compared the price of junk food, processed food, and so on, compared to vegetables, meat, fruit, and, this latter food was actually cheaper. I am not saying everyone who is impoverished can even afford those kinds of food and I understand that. But if they can afford a big bag of Doritos or super size their fast food, or other things of that nature, they can sure as heck afford meat, veggies, fruit, and some starch.

      I agree with the comments that say if someone has a medical condition that makes it hard to gain or lose weight, that is understandable. I have a thyroid condition and it is a slow process for me to lose weight and to keep it off, however, I am not obese, but I am not lazy either. However, the people who just eat junk food all day, sit around all day, and cry me a river because they are overweight or obese, I have no sympathy for. I am not saying everyone has to be stick thin either, but if someone actually eats right, is active, and is at least trying to maintain their weight, good for them. I do not know how I feel about calling obesity a disease. Yes, it is a problem in America, but I agree with some of the other comments, that if it is called a disease, for the obese who are just plain lazy, this will be cop-out for them. I think there are other ways that America can fight and help the obese without calling it a disease.

      1. Totally in agreement. It’s all about Food security I guess. You had the opportunity to use food stamps for healthy foods in your neighborhood, but there are stores that do not accept food stamps for certain healthy foods and accept food stamps for only unhealthy foods (because of price differences). Or, there are stores that label unhealthy foods as healthy (i.e. fruit juices, dairy products…etc.) These neighborhoods don’t give their constituents fair treatment.

        What I was trying to get at in my post was yes, this classification may help, but more importantly there should be an emphasis on building healthier neighborhoods and communities (because there will always be those better off who will choose to eat 1000000 bags of doritos, we should try to help those who can’t help it).

        Anyway, there is an excellent documentary called “Unnatural Causes” which I watched many times in my many classes (professors seems to love this documentary, which is great because I love it too).There is a section on neighborhoods and health. Here is a link to the documentary with the more relevant episode if you are interested! It’s great! Thanks for the response too, really well thought out :)

  4. Clever way to boost the pharmaceutical industry and take any responsibility away from the individuals. How do we supposedly contract this ‘disease’? Is it genetic? Because that would suggest that all those people who successfully overcame their obesity via exercise and a healthy diet actually altered their genetic make up.

    Also, how is it that so many individuals in countries like the US and UK have this ‘disease’, while in other countries this is simply not the case? I think a closer look at the food system here in the US would be much more useful, and would help explain why it is so hard for many people to lose the weight: High fructose corn syrup abounds, treats such as soda and ice creams come in GIGANTIC portions (even when a small is requested), and farmers have to jump through many hoops at great expense to have their food certified as organic, while the way is free and clear for others to mess with our food and use GMO’s as they see fit (which, btw, are banned in many non-obese European countries).
