Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should the death penalty be banned? | Debate.org
  • No to death penalty

    I believe that no one should be sentenced to the death penalty because no one should die just sentence to life in prison and i think that the family will felt bad but made at first but no one should feel that pain but at least that they kinda deserve

  • Yes the death penalty should be banned, Because:

    1. Since Canada stopped executing the murder rate has dropped by 44 per cent. Thus, The death penalty does not actually deter crime.
    2. We can’t give back a life once it is taken, And for one I would prefer a cautious approach to even the slightest possibility of taking an innocent person’s life. We can’t take back death, We know that systems make mistakes
    3.

  • Yes, death penalty should banned

    I think that death penalty should be banned for a number of reasons some include: if they are killed then you have done no favor to the world as they will never learn from their mistakes however they should be put in a long term jail and make them suffer the same way that the person they killed or did whatever to suffered. This way it will teach them a lesson and they will hopefully NOT do it again. Whereas in places that the person contentiously does hurt people will then be thought about having death penalties as that will be a sensible choice.

  • Yes, the death penalty should be banned.

    The death penalty should be banned for a number of reasons. Alternate appropriate punishments exist, including life in prison without the possibility of parole. The death penalty remains an arbitrary punishment, and continues to disproportionately impact poor people and racial minorities. A full 139 countries around the world no longer utilize the death penalty, according to the United Nations.

  • Yes, the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment.

    As more and more developed nations ban the death penalty, it is becoming clear that it is a form of cruel and unusual punishment, which is against the law. There is also no definitive way to know for sure that a person is guilty, making the process highly flawed and costing taxpayers too much money.

  • Yes, there are other forms of punishment that are more effective.

    Any sort of killing, whether it is government sanctioned or not, creates an environment where violence is an accepted norm, rather than an anomaly. Killing people for their crimes does not provide further justice nor greater comfort to the victims' families, but it does contribute to the violent cycle. With other, non-violent forms of punishment available, the death penalty is an inhumane penalty not befitting a developed nation.

  • In virtually all cases

    While I am in favor of using the death penalty for the worst of the worst (mass shooters, etc) I am against an overwhelming majority of the instances it has been used in. It's a barbaric practice that we should be past, yet here we are in a world that there are states freaking out about having difficulty getting their hands on the chemicals for lethal injections. This is not a culture we should be encouraging.

  • The death penalty is needed.

    I really do believe that there are some people in this world that truly need killing. And I do think that the state is sometimes justified in fulfilling that need. Sometimes the crimes are so great, the loss so profound, that the only way to make society whole again is by permanently removing those who dare to unravel it so brutally.

  • The death penalty should be banned.

    The death penalty is barbaric and it should be banned. It is not right to kill people, even if they have committed a serious crime. Also, a lot of people convicted for life have later been exonerated when new evidence comes to light. If they had been executed, it would have been in error.

  • Death penalty is beneficial for our lives.

    The death penalty should not be banned. Yes I agree that this goes against our human rights, But if the people who hurt others, Who disturb the girls which go home alone at night, Who kill someone who disturbs them did not get any punishment of their dishonest work, They will continue doing that and no one will dare to stop them. When they cross their limits in doing these things, They should be sentenced to death because they did not let the other people to live, And now they have also given up their most basic human right, "the right to live".

  • NO, death penalty should not be banned

    The death penalty should not be banned because it is equal justice for a number of crimes...But death penalty should not be extra painful or very cruel and evil like there used to be in history.Red raging bull,bamboo torture..All these execution methods were way too cruel...For example...In the house of dr.William 2 people came..Beated dr.William almost to death,raped his wife,sexually assaulted his 2 daughters which were 11 and 14 and then when everyone was alive they set the house on fire...Do you think it is okay to just give the 2 murderers life inprisonment or a fine or any other punishment...I think they should be given death penalty...Thankyou

  • The death penalty is a deterrent against heinous crimes.

    While the death penalty should only be used in extreme circumstances, it should be allowed as a deterrent against violent and heinous crimes such as murder and rape. The lack of potential punishment for a crime only encourages people to act upon some of their most violent natures, because they know the punishment will be less severe if they get caught.

  • Keep it going!

    I have always been a pretty big supporter of the death penalty. Even though I think a lot of people have some mix reactions and feelings about it. The way I see it, there are a lot of sick people out there, who commit sick crimes and I feel they deserve to be put to death.
