        "content": "This passage seems to be discussing a debate about whether or not the legal voting age in the United States should be lowered to 16. The author of the article argues that 16-year-olds possess the cognitive skills necessary for informed decision-making in a voting booth. Additionally, the author suggests that young people under the age of 18 should have a say in issues that impact their lives, such as gun control measures. The reader is asked to consider whether the brain science discussed in the article supports the argument for lowering the voting age, as well as what other reasons might exist for lowering or keeping the current voting age. Finally, students are asked whether they would vote if the voting age was lowered."
