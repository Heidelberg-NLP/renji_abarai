Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Disfranchising Convicted Felons and Restoring Their Right to Vote

Disfranchising Convicted Felons and Restoring Their Right to Vote

Voting is a civil right. Each state must comply with Federal civil rights laws and the US Constitution, but each state has flexibility in determining if people convicted of a felony lose the right to vote in local, state, and Federal elections.

Virginia became the first state to ban felons from voting, in 1830. When Virginia adopted its second constitution that year, white males who met the minimum property requirements lost the right to vote once they were convicted of an "infamous offence." Prior to the Civil War, most other states followed the example of Virginia and banned felons from voting.1

That restriction has been retained and expanded in all subsequent constitutions. In 1851, conviction for bribery was added as a disqualifying act. Specific reference to felony convictions was added starting in 1869. County officials were directed to create and maintain registers of all people convicted in local courts, which documented who had lost the right to vote.2

Disfranchising felons was not a law passed by the General Assembly originally to suppress the African-American vote in 1830, since the opportunity for a free black man to vote in 1830 was tiny. However, the governor took note of how the percentage of free blacks in jail was four times greater than the percentage of whites, so the racial element was considered when the 1830 law was passed.

The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, theoretically ensuring black men the right to vote. The Virginia legislature then took advantage of a provision in the 14th Amendment, which said:3

But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

The key clause was "except for participation in rebellion, or other crime." In 1876, the General Assembly added petit larceny to the list of crimes which barred a person from voting. Arresting and convicting black men of petty theft was an easy process, when judges were exclusively conservative white men and juries were filled with white men who still viewed blacks through the lens of enslavement. Those convicted might serve a short sentence, but could be blocked from voting for the rest of their life.

The potential for Federal troops to ensure equal application of the law disappeared in 1877. The US Army was withdrawn from Virginia as part of the bargain to resolved the disputed 1876 presidential election and place Rutherford B. Hayes in office. Without Federal law enforcement, local officials were able to use the power of white sheriffs and white juries to selectively convict black men of crimes and disfranchise a bloc who voted consistently for Republican candidates (the "party of Lincoln"), or for the Readjuster Party until it collapsed in 1883.

Intimidation and manipulation of the voting process were used to disfranchise voters not expected to support conservative Democratic candidates, minimizing the impact of the Fifteenth Amendment. Election officials segregated voters into white and "colored" lines, then selectively sped the white voters through the process while delaying black voters.

Courts were required to send a list of those convicted to registrars. Electoral boards, registrars, and local police were almost always conservative white men. Democratic operatives, stationed at key precincts on election day, reviewed the list of those who had been convicted of petit larceny or felonies and challenged the right of black men to vote.

Disfranchising black Republicans and associating the Democratic Party with white power made Virginia one of the one-party states in the South. After the defeat of the Readjuster Party in 1883, the primary of just the Democratic Party determined who would be elected in the general election. That one-party dominance based on maintaining white supremacy lasted for nine decades. A republican was finally elected governr in 1969, as a relative liberal who made promises to support racial equality. The realignment of the political parties in Virginia, in which the Republicans became the conservative option for local/state offices - as well as national offices - occurred in 1973.

In 1982, 63% of the voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the General Assembly to modify Section 1, Article 2 of the state constitution and alter the automatic disfranchisement of felons. After the turbulent 1960's and passage of civil rights legislation at he Federa level, the automatic loss of voting rights for petit larceny was dropped from the Virginia constitution in 1971. That mitigated the impact of the disfranchisement provision, but did not eliminate racial imbalance. Felons were still automatically disfranchised after implementation of the constitutional amendments in 1971. Disfranchisement based on felony convictions still discriminated against blacks, since minorities were convicted at far higher rates than whites:4

As of 2010, over 20 percent of the state's voting-age African American population could not vote as a result of a felony conviction, and nearly 7 percent of the state's total population 18 and older was disenfranchised. These statistics reflect both the extent of Virginia's felon disenfranchisement laws and the fact that African Americans in Virginia are currently incarcerated at a rate of approximately six times greater than the white population.

Governors had a way to counter the racial imbalance. When a new state constitution went into effect in 1870, the governor gained the power to restore voting rights. A Virginia Supreme Court decision in 1883, Edwards v. The Commonwealth, ruled that pardons should not be used to restore citizenship rights, but governors could still take a separate action to re-enfranchise those who had been disqualified.

The provision in the state constitution that stripped away the right to vote from those convicted of petit larceny was retained in the 1902 constitution, but removed in the 1971 revision. As of 2021, the state constitution still said (emphasis added):5

Section 1. Qualifications of voters

In elections by the people, the qualifications of voters shall be as follows: Each voter shall be a citizen of the United States, shall be eighteen years of age, shall fulfill the residence requirements set forth in this section, and shall be registered to vote pursuant to this article. No person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to vote unless his civil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority. As prescribed by law, no person adjudicated to be mentally incompetent shall be qualified to vote until his competency has been reestablished...

Federal courts in 1996 (Perry v. Beamer and in 2000 (Howard v. Gilmore) upheld the legality of Virginia's process for disfranchising felons. Judges ruled that the state was not violating the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

In 2002, Democratic Governor Mark Warner revised the process for restoring voting rights. He reduced the traditional waiting period after sentencing for non-violent crimes from five-seven years down to three years. In 2013, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell made 350,000 felons eligible for restoration, if they had completed their sentences and paid all costs mandated by a court. Until that time, only 3% of felons had managed to complete the process to apply for restoration and get the governor to allow them to vote.

In 2016, Governor McAuliffe issued a blanket restoration of rights for all felons who had served their time and had completed any supervised release, parole or probation requirements. The governor used the powers granted to him in Article V, Section 12 of the Constitution of Virginia to restore civil rights, including the right to vote to 206,000 people in the state's database of felons eligible for restoration under McAuliffe's criteria.

Much of the news coverage suggested focused on how the newly-enfranchised voters might support Democratic candidates in the 2016 election, and Republicans filed suit to block the blanket restoration of rights. The Virginia Supreme Court quickly ruled in a 4-3 decision that the governor's blanket restoration order was not constitutional, and he had to individually re-enfranchise the felons:6
