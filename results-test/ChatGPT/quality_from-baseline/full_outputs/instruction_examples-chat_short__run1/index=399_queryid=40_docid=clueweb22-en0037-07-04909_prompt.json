Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Imagine finding out that one of your classmates, cousin, or companion (alliteration), was brutally raped, shot, murdered (Climax), and left on the street like a dead animal. Justice might not be properly served because you do not know what kind of punishment the murderer will get because he or she can be charged with 3rd degree murder or the murderer can be considered insane, thus not being guilty. Murder is stealing the chance for people to achieve their dreams. (Metaphor)
An issue that has created lots of tension in society today, the death penalty is constantly questioned on whether or not it gives proper justice. Many see the death penalty as a violation of the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution, stating that it is a “cruel and unusual” form of punishment. However, according to disastercenter.com, 11,251,828 crimes were reported in 2007, with 16,929 being murder. That is an average of 46 murders per day, all around the United States. The sole purpose of the legal and criminal justice system of the United States is to protect its citizens. To do so, punishment must be given out to stop potential criminals. Although many oppose using the death penalty as punishment for murder due to the fact that there are options such as life in prison and it exhibiting a wrong message, the death penalty should be used for people who kill others because justice is better served, it is cheaper to use the death penalty in the long run, and it prevents criminals another chance to kill.
The death penalty serves justice to the victim in that if the murderer is sent to jail, they are still provided with the necessities to live. According to Jonathan Richards on an article about Federal Prison states, “You will be fed three times a day by a guard or inmate orderly.” It is unfair that murderers can be fed three times a day, whereas some people in the United States cannot even eat one...

Conflicting Viewpoints

...Essay Andrea Counts Professor Lincoln Schreiber Critical Thinking May 3, 2015 Capital punishment, or the death penalty, is the punishment for a crime by death ("legal definition of capital punishment," n.d.). It is usually administered via the use of lethal injection for heinous crimes such as murder and other serial offenses. I am a defendant of capital punishment for several different reasons, which are detailed in this assignment. One of the main premises that support my position as a defendant of the death penalty is the separation of church and state ("Should the death penalty be allowed?" n.d.). Many opponents of the death penalty contend that it is an immoral act, as it essentially murder and that murder is inherently wrong. This viewpoint is flawed due to the fact that the United States is a country that believes in separation of church and state. Murder is a sin in many religions, but religion cannot play a role in how punishment for crime is carried out, nor is there anything in the constitution asserting that the death penalty as a form of punishment is against any civil liberties afforded to the citizens of this country. The death penalty is reserved for and carried out on the worst of the worst ("Should the death penalty be allowed?" n.d.). I agree with this premise and it goes back to my original statement in which I said the death penalty is used as punishment for those who have committed heinous crimes. There are those who commit crimes so......

Death Penalty

...Abstract The essay outlines the arguments for abolishing the death penalty, also including any counter arguments that can be used for a use of the death penalty. The arguments made in this essay for death-penalty abolition are its devaluation of human life, eliminating of the possibility for revenge, its violation of human rights, as well as including the view of religious groups. This essay argues that all of these arguments address that human life cannot be taken away from a person, even if the person is a murder, simply because then the society is not being better than the murder him- or herself. I have investigated many research and scientific studies in order to back up my arguments as best as possible. Furthermore I have also investigated into the methods of death penalty, such as lethal injection. This essay views practice of capital punishment as an expression of anxiety about safety, in particular it counteracts the argument that death penalty would deter any future crime, and terrorist attacks. I also looked up numbers in order to show how costly death penalty is, in order to emphasize that there are more cheaper and less inhumane methods to sentence a murder. I also draw attention to countries that use death penalty as a way to eliminate any enemies, using it as a political weapon to silence any troublesome individuals. I suggest that every life is valuable, and that death penalty does not consider the risk of killing an innocent person, but rather emphasize......

Death Penalty

...Death Penalty: the easy way out Capital punishment is one of the most controversial issues discussed in the United States. Capital punishment or the death penalty, is used throughout most of the U.S. The debate is over if the death penalty is humane or cruel and unusual. Those against the death penalty believe the death penalty should be removed from the United States all together. There are also some who are against the death penalty because of their religion. Anti-death penalty activist are not only against the death penalty because of the inhumane acts associated with it, but also because of the expenses. I, too, am against the death penalty. With the death penalty part of our country, I believe that we are no better than any other country. The death penalty is wrong and so are the methods used to execute those sentenced to it. There are many reasons to why the death penalty should be abolished from the United States. This year alone, twenty-eight people were executed. Last year forty-three were executed and in 2005, sixty people were executed. The year of 1990 has the most executions at an outstanding number of ninety-eight executions. Since 1976 there have been 1,305 executions. Out of the fifty states, only seventeen are without the death penalty. There are still about 3,170 inmates on death row right now. Throughout the years, the numbers have raised. Those states that are for the death penalty actually have higher crime rates than those who have abolished it. The......
