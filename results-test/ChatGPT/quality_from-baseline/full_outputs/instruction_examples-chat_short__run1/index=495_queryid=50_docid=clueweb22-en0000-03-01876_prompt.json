Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

What Is Universal Basic Income?

Universal Basic Income Explained

Universal basic income (UBI) is a government-guaranteed payment that each citizen receives. It is also called a citizen’s income, guaranteed minimum income, or basic income.

The intention behind the payment is to provide enough to cover the basic cost of living and establish a sense of financial security for everyone. The concept is also seen as a way to offset job losses caused by technology. Learn more about how it works, its pros and cons, and what it might look like in the U.S.

Definition and Examples of Universal Basic Income

Universal basic income is a program where every citizen receives a flat monthly payment, regardless of whether they're working and earning an income.

Different programs outline who exactly receives the income—some state that all citizens would get it regardless of what they make, while other programs may only give it to those who fall below the poverty line. One proposal would pay just those left jobless due to robotics, a plan that 48% of Americans support.1

  • Alternate names: Citizen’s income, guaranteed minimum income, or basic income
  • Acronym: UBI

In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. argued that a guaranteed income would directly abolish poverty.2

How Universal Basic Income Works

Proponents of universal basic income vary widely in their views of how to fund and execute the program. Some plans call for a tax increase on the wealthy, while others say corporations should be taxed.

Economist Milton Friedman proposed a negative income tax. The poor would receive a tax credit if their income fell below a minimum level. It would be equivalent to the tax payment for the families earning above the minimum level.3 

In 2018, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes outlined his plan in his book "Fair Shot."4 He argued that U.S. workers, students, and caregivers making $50,000 or less a year should receive a guaranteed income of $500 a month.

“Cash is the best thing you can do to improve health outcomes, education outcomes and lift people out of poverty,” Hughes has said in interviews. His guaranteed income plan is financed by taxes on the top 1%. It would work through a modernization of the earned income tax credit.

Sir Richard Branson said a guaranteed income is inevitable because automation has fundamentally changed the structure of the U.S. economy. Similarly, Elon Musk said robotics will take away most people’s jobs, so a universal income is the only solution.

Pros and Cons of Universal Basic Income

Pros
  • Workers could wait for better jobs or better wages

  • Freedom for people to return to school or stay home to care for a relative

  • May help remove the "poverty trap" from traditional welfare programs

  • Simple, straightforward financial assistance that minimizes bureaucracy

  • Lower administrative costs than with traditional welfare

  • More money for young families

  • Economic stability during recessions

Cons
  • Could trigger inflation

  • No increased standard of living in the long run

  • Reduced program wouldn't make real difference

  • Free income may not incentivize people to get jobs

  • Could perpetuate falling labor force participation rate

  • Many oppose giving money to the unemployed

Pros Explained

  • Workers could wait for better situations: An unconditional basic income would enable workers to wait for a better job or negotiate better wages.5
  • Freedom for people to return to school or stay home to care for a relative: Workers could improve their marketability by going back to school. They would feel less pressure to keep a job if they needed to take time to care for a relative.
  • May help remove the "poverty trap" from traditional welfare programs: Many existing welfare programs are criticized for keeping people below the poverty line. Oftentimes, if welfare recipients make too much, they lose food stamps, free medical care, and housing vouchers, even if their income is still unequal to the cost of living. A basic income could serve as a supportive springboard rather than a chain to the welfare system.6
  • Simple, straightforward financial assistance that minimizes bureaucracy: Current welfare programs are also complicated for administrators and recipients. A universal income would replace housing vouchers, food stamps, and other programs.
  • Lower administrative costs than with traditional welfare: The simplicity of the program means it would also cost governments less. Cash payments that went to everyone would eliminate costly income-verification paperwork.
  • More money for young families: Some countries are concerned about falling birth rates. A guaranteed income would give young couples the confidence they need to start a family.
  • Economic stability during recessions: From a macro-economic viewpoint, it would give society a much-needed ballast during a recession.

Cons Explained

  • Could trigger inflation: If everyone suddenly received a basic income, it could create inflation. Most would immediately seek to spend the extra cash, driving up demand and, eventually, raising prices.
  • No increased standard of living in the long run: Higher prices would soon make the basics unaffordable to those at the bottom of the income pyramid. In the long run, a guaranteed income would not raise their standard of living.
  • Reduced program wouldn't make a real difference: A guaranteed income that’s enough to eliminate poverty would be too expensive. That makes a truly effective program a difficult investment.
  • Free income may not incentivize people to get jobs: Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, says it would make work seem optional.7 Many recipients might prefer to live on the free income and would not acquire work skills or a good resume.
  • Could perpetuate falling labor force participation rate: This cycle could prevent some from ever getting a
