Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

IN his opinion piece in MJA InSight, Professor Emeritus Ian Maddocks proposes an integration of palliative care, euthanasia, and physician assisted suicide (EPAS). As palliative care practitioners, we know this supposed common ground is both a contradiction in terms and contrary to sound medical practice.

From our experience of caring for people who are ill and vulnerable, legalising EPAS is unnecessary and unsafe.

Despite its inevitability, dying is not a popular topic for discussion in Australia today. In the words of American surgeon Dr Atul Gawande, we have “forgotten that we are mortal”. Death is not a medical or pharmacological event. It remains instead a profound mystery and the natural end of the complex journey of life. It is universal yet unique, personal but communal. It affects us all.

Dying can be traumatic, terrifying and painful for the patient, and challenging for the grieving family. In the face of inevitable death, some patients are willing to explore improbable alternative therapies, or burdensome or experimental treatments that may have a very low success rate. If people insist that “everything be done”, they are likely to die in the medically confronting environment of an intensive care unit, possibly prolonging the process of dying itself.

Good palliative care helps patients and families avoid both overtreatment and neglect of treatment. It enhances patient autonomy and decision-making capacity by improving symptom control and empowering patients to participate in their care. We affirm the patient’s right to choose their therapy; decline futile therapy; choose the place of dying; choose who should be present; receive the best possible relief of symptoms, even, on rare occasions, deliberate palliative sedation (not terminal sedation); and refuse to prolong the dying process. Ideally, this should be readily available for all those with life-limiting illness.

Autonomy does not include the right to demand that a clinician kills the person. Contrary to public opinion, the use of therapeutic doses of analgesia or sedation in order to relieve difficult and intractable discomfort does not hasten death and is not a form of euthanasia. Appropriate end of life prescribing of analgesia is simply good clinical practice when the patient is actively dying.

Supporting people when they are dying is utterly different to intentionally causing them to die. What Professor Maddocks calls “a single effective intervention” is in fact an act of killing.

The term “voluntary assisted dying” conceals the true nature of what is proposed in the bill before the Victorian parliament. The patient’s dying is not assisted; rather, a doctor is required to kill the patient or to help the patient commit suicide. The word “voluntary” attempts to emphasise the patient’s autonomy. Ironically, EPAS legislation weakens patient autonomy by devaluing the final stages of life. Further, overseas experience has shown that supposed safeguards within these laws do not effectively guard the autonomy of those most vulnerable to the extension of these laws.

In an attempt to make EPAS publicly acceptable, its proponents sanitise the language, using euphemisms such as “voluntary-assisted dying” and “go gentle”. However, the inconvenient truth remains that at the heart of EPAS, the action of the doctor is to end a patient’s life or assist patients to kill themselves. This has profound ramifications for all health professionals. “Do not kill” has been a core ethical principle of every civilisation and the practice of medicine; we violate it at society’s peril.

Quality health care manages the causes of patients’ distress rather than ending life. In our experience, requests to terminate life prematurely are uncommon and often a cry for help. Such requests rarely spring from uncontrolled pain, but rather from despair, a sense of loss of control, or fear of being a burden to others. Evidence shows that a person’s desire for hastened death changes over time and reduces when care is good. It is illogical and immoral to even consider euthanasia legislation before ensuring there is universal access to palliative care.

The 1990 World Health Organization definition states that palliative care affirms living and dying as a normal process, and “neither hastens nor defers death”. Likewise, after extensive research and consultation, the Australian and New Zealand Society for Palliative Medicine (ANZSPM) issued a position statement on EPAS in 2013.

This statement affirmed that:

  • the discipline of palliative medicine does not include the practice of EPAS; and
  • ANZSPM opposes the legalisation of EPAS.

In the Netherlands, often quoted as a euthanasia success story, so many doctors have refused to kill their patients that the government has established mobile euthanasia teams to perform EPAS across the country. Doctors in Canada are increasingly requesting to be removed from “assisted dying” lists. The legalisation of EPAS results in great harm to vulnerable individuals, families, the community and health professionals.

Paradoxically, it is in dying naturally that many people find healing and realise what is truly important in their lives. They may experience profound personal growth and family reconciliation. Indeed, as Canadian surgeon, Professor Balfour Mount, who coined the term “palliative care” wrote: “It is possible to die healed”.

We write as an informal network of Australian and New Zealand practitioners in palliative care. We do not represent any particular organisation, institution or philosophy. Some of us have practised palliative medicine for more than 30 years. We acknowledge that death, like birth, can be distressing and messy. We are deeply concerned at the increasingly determined attempts to legalise the practice of EPAS.

We believe that these attempts may be sincere and well meaning, but unfortunately are based on ignorance and misunderstanding. The first step towards a clear understanding of the issues is to use clear, unambiguous terminology. Irrespective of whether EPAS is legalised in Australia or New Zealand, EPAS has no part in the ethical and professional practice of palliative medicine.

    If physician-assited euthansia is legalised there will ensue a more sombre quality in the oft-repeated threat that parents tell to their misbehaving children at the doctor’s surgery – “Behave yourself, or the doctor will give you a needle!!!”
