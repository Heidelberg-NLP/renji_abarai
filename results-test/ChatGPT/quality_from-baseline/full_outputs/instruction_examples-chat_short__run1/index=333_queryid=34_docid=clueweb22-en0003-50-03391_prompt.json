Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Positive Impact of Social Networking for Our Society

Many people use technology as a tool to help communicate with other people throughout the whole world. This is a great and positive impact on our society; we are putting our technologies into use. Many people say they get updated current information mainly on social networking sites. Social networking sites are‚Äú‚Ä¶an online service that is based around the building and reflecting of social relations among individuals‚Ä¶‚Äù says Boyd (as cited in Sweeney, 2011).

Some examples of social site would be Facebook, Bebo, MySpace, and etc.

People in our society are so busy to the point that they do not have time to inform everyone on their contact list about something important and this is when social site becomes useful. Everyone is already added on as your friends on people‚Äôs profile and by just posting up a status everyone will see your updates. Social networking sites are a positive influence on our society by making our communications strategies easier, meet new people, and also allows having fun on a site that can lead you to many apps.

For example, in Sweeney‚Äôs article she states, ‚Äú‚Ä¶sites encourage you to edit your profile and that includes adding your interest, full name, where you live, who your top friends are, your email address and even personal details like your phone number and relationship status‚Äù.

This statement is true, however, the word ‚Äúencourage‚Äù is too strong. It‚Äôs more like they gave their users an option to put your information on your profile if they want to. These sites offered many apps as I‚Äôve mentioned, and all these examples that Sweeney stated in her argument is considered non-problematic. Many users know that they may refuse to put on any significant information onto their profile; therefore there is no one else to be blame but the user themselves. For example, my friend Cindy decided to make a Facebook account a couple years ago, she added all the people she knows, made her profile only viewable to only friend, put minimal information, and everything was fine. She had control over her social media application and was easily connecting with others sharing her chosen limited information, and having fun.

Technology‚Äôs purpose is to make life easier for all of us, so why blame it when we have the power and choice to decide to put information on our profile by our own freewill. These social networking sites are mainly for us to communicate with people and also to meet new people from other places. It‚Äôs up the uses to have a positive impact on our society and they are the ones who give purpose to social networking. Like I have mentioned, users are the real problem here. For example, bad users attempt cyber bullying, interfere with work, and many more. One of the main thing that affects people the most is cyber bullying ‚Äúbullying through information and communication technologies‚Äù Webster (as cited in Sweeney, 2011).

For example, my nephew was being threatened by some other students in school; we contacted Facebook, report them as spam and blocked them. And after that we never heard from them again, so sometimes to make sure that things are safe contact the web owner and take actions. Things can be changed with the help of users and the site to make sure that the purposes of those sites stays positive and safe and fun. Social networking websites again is a place to meet new people, and it‚Äôs supposed to be an enjoyable website not a crime or bullying website.

Some apps on these websites are supposed to be fun and entertaining. There are apps such as games, chatting, birthday club, and many more. Social websites are a positive influence on our community. Communicating is a very important routine in people‚Äôs lives, and technology is one of the greatest ways of how people communicate. Social networking sites purpose is to make it easier to meet new people and to let people enjoy the website. These sites are not meant to hurt anyone, and with the help of users and the website making it safe and fun for everyone, these websites will continue being a positive place for communicating. Be the better person and make these websites go back to their better ways and make sure it stays like that.
