Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Pro & Con Quotes: Is Golf a Sport?

PRO (yes)

Pro 1

Jentry Barton, National Director of Fitness at US Sports Camps, stated in her Jan. 23, 2019 article titled “Believe It Or Not Golf Is A Sport,” available at scga.org:

“In the golf swing, your body twists, torques, and turns to create a violent energy. While using the ground as force, it spirally connects your legs, core, and spine to create impact into a tiny white ball…

Now, don’t be fooled. Golf is hard. Even the professionals have days where they can’t get it to go straight. The hardest working athletes still fall, and especially in golf. Golf is not just a challenge of the body, but also of the mind. But do not be mistaken, golf is a sport. The golf swing is a learned, yet athletic move.”

Pro 2

Jake Woolf, style writer at GQ, wrote the following in his Aug. 17, 2015 article titled “In Praise of Swole Golfers,” available at gq.com:

“When [Tiger Woods] first turned pro in 1996, he stood 6’1” and weighed only about 150 lbs wet… Within a few years, he had bulked up to the 185 lb frame he has today, along the way winning 14 majors and proving that if you want to be the best golfer in the world, you better hit the weight room after 18 holes instead of the 19th hole bar.

The fact that these guys consider themselves athletes at all is evidence of a seismic shift in the landscape. Ultimately, these young guns took a page out of Tiger’s book and literally beat him at his own game, putting as much effort into their core as they do into their chip shots. Though golf may still be considered a leisure sport, the sheer power Rory McIlroy exhibits when driving a ball 350 yards off the tee looks like anything but a walk in the park. (Or, you know, 436 yards.) With the results to prove that fitness leads to wins, this new generation of planking, squatting, deadlifting golfers have finally erased the stigma that golf is just for fat old men.”

Pro 3

Mario Santos-Davidson, college golfer at Whitman College, stated the following in Sep. 20, 2015 article titled “6 Reasons That Prove Golf Is a Sport,” available on the Odyssey website:

“The general perception of golf is that it is a hobby for old, rich, white men who have nothing else to do with their lives. While this may have once been true, golf has since spread all around the world and to all age ranges. Golf may seem boring, or easy, or otherwise unlike other sports, but it really should be counted among the likes of football, soccer, and basketball…

Golf may seem simple from the outside, but it’s one of the most complicated sports to date. So many factors go into every single shot, that no matter how long you play the sport, no two shots will ever be exactly the same…

Golfers must walk about 5 miles during a typical round, while carrying a 30-pound bag along for the 4 or 5 hour trek. This is not to mention the violence of the swing–twisting and turning your spine 40 times in a day requires some serious agility and athleticism. Hitting a golf ball requires an unbelievable amount of coordination.”

Ed Sherman, former golf writer at the Chicago Tribune, stated the following in a list titled “Golf Is a Sport,” published in the 2011 book Golf List Mania!: The Most Authoritative and Opinionated Rankings of the Best and Worst of the Game that he cowrote with Len Shapiro:

“If you’re going to discount golf as a sport because players like John Daly (the fat version), Tim Herron and Craig Stadler don’t have chiseled bodies, then I’ll present to you the image of the 340-pound offensive lineman with 60 pounds of flab hanging over his gut. Technically, all they do is stand up and try to get in somebody’s way. Carl Lewis, they’re not. I know there’s much more involved in being a lineman, especially with footwork. Hey, fat guys can be athletes, too…

If golf isn’t a sport, then how come the best athletes in the world can’t master it? Jerry Rice might have been the best football player ever, yet he shot a round in the 90s when he tried to tee it up on the Nationwide Tour. Michael Jordan only dreams of being a professional golfer. Yes, golf is a hard sport…

Sadly, if you can take steroids to improve your performance, then you’re a sport. Golf falls under that category. Golf was way behind the curve on this, but officials finally did institute testing for performance enhancing drugs. Just like sports such as baseball and football, golf reacted to curb a potential problem…

Just like the other sports, the mental aspect is huge in golf. The player who can think his way around the course, who can handle and overcome adversity, who can stare down an opponent, who can will the putt in the hole with everything on the line, always will reign supreme in golf. Michael Jordan had it in his sport. Tiger Woods has it in his sport.”

Mark Willard, ESPN Radio Host and Columnist for Fore Magazine, stated the following in his Summer 2014 column titled “Range Tokens: If Golfers Aren’t Athletes, Then Why Do So Many Athletes Play Golf?,” published in Fore Magazine:

“I hear the silly argument all the time: Golfers aren’t athletes. Funny, I only hear it from people who don’t play golf. That’s because the golfer understands how many athletic movements are needed in order to play well. There is athleticism in trying to hit out of a bunker, plain and simple. Hooking a ball around a tree to get back in the fairway takes athleticism…

Maybe the best evidence is the fact that so many athletes from other sports play golf. In other words, what does a big time athlete do to challenge themselves outside their normal game? They play golf…

What is the anatomy of an athlete? An athlete uses his or her body to get competitive juices flowing, release stress and energy, express themselves and have fun. So, that makes golfers athletes. And it makes athletes want to golf.”

Brett Hull, Hall of Fame and two-time Stanley Cup winning former National Hockey League (NHL) player, stated the following in an article by Peter McCleery titled “Are Golfers Really Athletes?,” published May 2, 2007 in Golf Digest:

“Sure it’s a sport. People don’t understand what it takes to be an elite athlete in any sport. To me the mental preparation and toughness in golf blows away what it takes in any sport. Just because golfers don’t wear running shoes and don’t run down the fairway doesn’t mean they aren’t athletes.”

Pro 7

Neil Wolkodoff, PhD, Medical Director at the Denver Center for Health & Sport Science, stated the following in an Aug. 10, 2010 New York Times article written by Bill Pennington titled “A Little Scientific Research for All Those 19th-Hole Debates,” available on nytimes.com:

“There are a lot of ways to define a sport. But we know that the golf swing uses almost every muscle group in the body. We know it uses a pretty significant amount of energy — not as much as running a 10K but more than people think. And one significant measure of a sport is whether physical training improves your ability to perform, and I think that’s been proven in golf.

So in my estimation, it’s absolutely a sport.”

Aug. 10, 2010 - Neil Wolkodoff, PhD

Pro 8

Sterling Sharpe, television analyst for the NFL Network and former Green Bay Packers wide receiver, stated the following in a Jan. 3, 2011 video produced by Nike titled “Is Golf a Sport?,” available at YouTube.com:

“What makes golf a sport is that it combines, just like all the other reactionary sports, it combines both physical and mental… You have to have the physical ability to move the golf ball from point A to point B, but you also have to have to mental capacity to understand how to get that done in the best, most efficient way possible. So, combining both the physical and mental makes golf a sport.”

Jan. 3, 2011 - Sterling Sharpe

Pro 9

Stephanie Wei, golf blogger and former member of the Yale University women’s golf team, stated the following in her July 22, 2009 article titled “Is Golf a “Real” Sport?,” published on The Huffington Post:

“While I can’t deny the argument that golf doesn’t demand the same strength and power required in other sports such as basketball and football, it does require athleticism…

It’s called being able to consistently swing a club with the same motion and tempo. And it’s not as easy as it may look.

There’s also a little something called endurance. Even an athletic person will tire after playing and walking 18 holes. Try carrying your own bag around a hilly course in 90-degree heat. Or repeating the same swing all day, and with accuracy. Then get back to me about golf not requiring any kind of athletic ability.

Most professional golfers are in great shape. They do work out. Golf calls for tremendous coordination, stamina and strength, albeit a different kind. Call it whatever you want — a sport, game or hobby. It doesn’t matter. In my opinion, Old Man [Tom] Watson’s epic performance [at the 2009 British Open] further validated why golf is the best sport ever.”

July 22, 2009 - Stephanie Wei

Pro 10

Tim McDonald, Contributing Writer for TravelGolf.com, stated the following in his July 11, 2010 article titled “Golf Isn’t Just a ‘Sport,’ It’s the Hardest of Them,” published on TravelGolf.com:

“[I]f you believe a sport requires eye-hand coordination, intense focus, stamina and a cut-throat sense of competition, you cannot help but call golf a sport.

The hardest of them. If it isn’t difficult, then why do so many, even the pros, have such a devil of a time hitting a ball straight that isn’t moving? The last time I looked, golf doesn’t throw high and tight sliders at you…

Golf is much more physical than, say, softball or bowling, and you never hear those sports’ legitimacy being questioned. Or at least you hear them questioned less often.”
