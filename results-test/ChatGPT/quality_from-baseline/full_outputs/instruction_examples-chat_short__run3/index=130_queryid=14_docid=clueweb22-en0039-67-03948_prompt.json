You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is sexual orientation determined at birth? | Debate.org
  • No its not

    No bcuz gay ppl probly got bitton buy a bug or smhtn. In my Opinion there is a bug that containes the gay sindrome and thats how pepol becum super gay. An exampole of dsi is whn my bigger bruder was in de woods and got bit and became gay.

  • It's a intuitive feeling

    This homosexuality is in your body even in your genes so how could we deny that homosexuality is abnormal or acquired with education or social media (I don't say they don't effect our thoughts)? Homosexual people is tortured and harassed by narrow-minded also devote people so why they keep loving the same gender or both genders even if they're harassed or killed?
    Suppose that we choose our orientation, why in nature over 450 species of animals are homo?

  • Determined at birth

    There is no way that sexuality is a choice. I'm a lesbian and I have recently looked back at my childhood and found many girl 'crushes' and non-attraction to boys. It's absurd how I can look back and realize i was like this all my life and this isn't a choice and I shouldn't be ashamed or have to defend my side.

  • Why would they choose this life

    Studies show that homosexually attracted people have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why would someone willingly choose to enter a life that could very well lead to that? They are born the way they are, and that's not abnormal. Homosexual attraction is shown to affect the same parts of the brain as left-handedness. No one considers a left-handed person to be abnormal, or born with some defect. Love is love.

  • Born That Way

    All of the LGBTQ+ members that I know of have told me that they feel they are born that way, and all the straight people I know of say they don't believe it. There has been similar genes found in gay males, which is still being fully discovered. Being questioning (which I have been for as long as I can remember) , I feel that was born like that as I was questioning at such an early age.

  • You are born with your sexual orientation, you do not choose it.

    A person's sexual orientation has been shown to be determined at birth or a very young age. When speaking with members in the LGBT community, they will state that they are not making a choice for their sexual orientation, but there was always a need or preference towards a particular gender.

  • People are who they are

    There is no way to tell a person what their sexual orientation should be. They have something inside them that tells them what to feel and who to feel it for. This is inside them since birth. It isn't possible to sway someone because you don't like what they are choosing.

  • It's determined at birth, Not chosen

    A boy suddenly starts liking is friend who is boy. Did he choose that? No, It just happened automatically because of his genes and hormones. I, A girl, Who like boys not because of choice but because I was born with it. It makes me feel weird when I think about liking girls, Even if I was pressured into it. I would not like girls because I was born with a brain like that.
    Same with other people, Their feeling come from their hormones and genes, Not choice

  • There is definitely a bug

    I swear I saw that bug my guy was talking bout. I definitely felt it bit me but I had some epinephrine so it's cool. I think it comes with the winter wind. Just make sure to cover up in the cold and always carry some halls. Good luck Yall's'.

  • You are who you are. Never be embarrassed because of it.

    In my honest opinion. You can not say that it is determined by your home life because I am a transgender pansexual person and my parents hate it. I have always been like this. I never understood what it was really but, Now I do. I knew I was gay at a very young age when I realized I liked my best friend more than other people liked their's. I just recently figured out I was trans, Though. I had spent most of my life hating girly things, Hating my name, Hating being referred to as a girl and I never really understood why until my friend explained it to me. It was indeed determined at birth. I didn't change over years. I've been this way since I was born. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

  • Sexual orientation is something people either choose or are pressured into

    No one is born gay, lesbian, or bisexual or pansexual or whatever. Whether it results from child abuse, gay rape, peer pressure, or simply being called "gay" by people around you, sexual orientation is a choice. Everyone is born straight, because to be heterosexual is to follow the natural way of things. If someone is homosexual then something has happened to them to make them that way. And if someone is homosexual, it doesn't define them. They don't have to be homosexual. It is a choice

  • People get to choose if they are gay or not it depends on how they are raised and such.

    When a mom wants a girl instead of a guy they would treat their boy as a girl which is going to make him gay. And such. And when parents do this it causes people to change. This is what happend to my sister mom wanted a dude and she turned into a dike.,

  • Just no no

    How can a baby say they are gay or not its just not right just stick to nature and no need to change life ahah hahah. LGBT is just overexaggerated and they want people to feel sorry for them just grow up and be normal people like odd people yu kno

  • No one chooses sexual orientation

    It is upbringing, culture, that shapes a person yes people do have genetics that they do not have any control over but I don’t believe sexual orientation is determined after birth not at birth, if it were determined at birth it would almost certaintly be genetic, i know a set of identical twins who share 100% DNA as identical twins do, one of them is homosexual and one of them is heterosexual, nothing wrong with homosexuality but it is not determined at birth but rather determined after birth

  • A matter of what your belief system is.

    I personally feel like being anything other than heterosexual is not by design. To unequivocally call it a choice would not be correct either. I believe that culture and your environment play key roles in how a person perceives themselves to be. Yes, a person can begin to feel different from everyone else at a young age, but what was the environmental circumstances surrounding them at the time. No one can fully know, not even the person who is affected. It could have been one minute situation that swayed how that person developed in early childhood. What culture did you experience growing up? I feel like when children are their most vulnerable, is during the early developmental stages and we are all conditioned into who we ultimately become. I love everyone, gay, straight, and in between, but my belief system will not allow me to believe that God created us to not procreate. Then what would this world be if people stop creating other people!

  • You don't chose it. You experience it.

    I am bisexual myself and I didn't know that I was after kissing a girl. I was always attracted to guys but I never thought about being attracted to girls. After a small kiss from a girl, I couldn't stop thinking about how amazing it felt. But I still liked guys. At first I got very confused but now that I got to know that it is an okay thing, I learned to accept myself of being bisexual. After all those years of fear of anyone finding out that I liked both genders, I now classify myself as bisexual. Only after that experience.
