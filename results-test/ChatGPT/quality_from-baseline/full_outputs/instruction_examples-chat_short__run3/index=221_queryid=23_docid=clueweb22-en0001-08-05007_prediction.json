        "content": "The given text discusses the topic of euthanasia and argues against its legalization. The author presents several reasons against euthanasia, such as the risk of abuse, the distinction between passive and active euthanasia, and the availability of palliative care programs. The author also addresses the slippery slope argument and questions whether legalizing euthanasia could enable broader applications that could be unethical or immoral. The writing is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear examples and a logical structure. Therefore, the rhetorical argument quality of the text is high."
