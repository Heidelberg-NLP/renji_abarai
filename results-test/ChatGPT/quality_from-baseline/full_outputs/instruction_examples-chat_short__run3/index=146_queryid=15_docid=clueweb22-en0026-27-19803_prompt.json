Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Decent Essays
There are several types of animals being used for research, but not surviving the test. Animals are similar to human beings; they have hearts just like human beings. Researchers have absolutely no sympathy for these animals, including the vicious ones. All animals need some type of affection from humans, or else there is a high possibility the animals will not survive. Personally, animal researching should be banned, but doing so, the researchers would have to find something else or someone else to test the products on to make sure the products are useable to humans. The reasons for animal researching are understandable and could change a person’s decision whether or not they would want to ban animal testing. Scientific knowledge is…show more content…
N.p.. Web. 29 Jan 2014. <http://www.animalresearch.info/en/designing-research/why-animals-are-used/>.) Several pros say that animal researching is acceptable, but that side of the situation does not provide any decent reasoning or proof. The cons have good reasoning and proof. Animal researching has not saved many lives like one of the comments say. Animals are very different from humans, so they make poor testing subjects. One of the cons on the website states “Animal testing is cruel and inhumane.” Below the comment they explain that most animals are tested while being awake, without any anesthesia for relief. Testing animals might would be bearable if they put them asleep before putting them in pain. Testing drugs on animals can result in false test results. “The 1950s sleeping pill thalidomide, which caused 10,000 babies to be born with severe deformities, was tested on animals prior to its commercial release. Later tests on pregnant mice, rats, guinea pigs, cats, and hamsters did not result in birth defects unless the drug was administered at extremely high doses.” The comment above is proof that all tests that are tested on animals may not be accurate results, and could be harmful to many human.("Animal Testing." ProCon.org. N.p., 1 20 2014. Web. 29 Jan 2014. <http://animal-testing.procon.org/>.)
