        "content": "This text argues that the voting age should be lowered from 18 to 16 based on several pieces of evidence. One of them is the recent activism of high school students, who demonstrated an ability to reason logically with facts and engage in thoughtful protest against gun control issues. Another argument presented in the article is the findings of studies on cold cognitive abilities. These show that by the age of 16, young people can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Finally, the writer also refers to past social change movements when the voting age was lowered, such as the one motivated by outrage over the fact that 18-year-olds could be sent to fight in Vietnam but could not vote. \n\nThus, the article provides different reasons why the voting age should be lowered to 16. However, it also tries to anticipate some of the skeptics' concerns, such as the competence of 16-year-olds to make informed choices in the voting booth. While this is a valid concern, the text argues that teenagers can make decisions as valid as those of adults when it comes to cold cognition. Ultimately, the article invites students to take a position on the matter and provide additional arguments for or against lowering the legal voting age."
