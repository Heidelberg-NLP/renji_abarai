Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Students Have to Wear Physical Education Uniforms in School?

Before students can head for the field or the court, they must wear appropriate attire.

Physical education uniforms can help teachers get to know students better and unify the classmates. Or, they’re an unconstitutional mandate imposed by the nanny state. Public school districts that require physical education classes are divided on whether to require uniforms. Teachers love how uniforms foster discipline. But parents say they shouldn’t have to pay for something they and their children don’t want to own.

1 Appropriate Attire

A 2013 study from the Institute of Medicine found that less than half of American youths meet federal guidelines calling for at least 60 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. Mandatory physical education can help boost that figure. And if children are going to exercise, they will need appropriate clothing. The Calvert County School District in Maryland notes that not only is a change of clothes necessary after gym class due to sweat and body odor, but staph infections can result due to not changing clothes after a tough workout.

2 Pros

Central Dauphin High School in Pennsylvania mandates physical education uniforms because names written on them help teachers and substitutes keep track of who’s who in class. A teacher from that school district said uniforms help her keep track of non-students on school property. Uniforms can help schools institute discipline and provide a sense of school pride and unity among students. And uniforms eliminate any questions about what sort of clothes are appropriate and the distractions to learning that come along with inappropriate clothes.

3 Cons

But uniforms cost money, and a public education is supposed to be free. The American Civil Liberties Union sued the state of California in 2010 to block enforcement of its gym uniform policy due in part to the cost. A parent at Marysville High School in California contacted the ACLU because she didn’t want to be limited to the retailer of the school district’s choosing for the purchase of gym clothes. Some students simply want the freedom to dress as they please, a right guaranteed them by a longstanding U.S. Supreme Court decision that permitted students to wear black armbands in school to protest the Vietnam War.

4 Beyond the Uniform

The uniform debate could be settled as physical education -- and indeed regular education -- classes evolve. According to a 2012 report from the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, only 38 states require physical education classes. And not every child goes to a brick-and-mortar school. About 1.5 million American children are home schooled. CBS News reported in 2009 that 500,000 to 1 million take classes online, and that number is growing. Gym uniforms don’t matter to these children. Nor do they matter to children at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va., where teens get permission to work out before and after school but must wear a monitor to log hours spent exercising. In all three cases, the argument for gym uniforms becomes moot.
