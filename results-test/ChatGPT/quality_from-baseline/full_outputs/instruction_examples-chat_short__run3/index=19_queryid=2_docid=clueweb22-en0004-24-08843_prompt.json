Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Many now see vaping as a good alternative to smoking. But is it the safer option? Does vaping have any harmful effects? Here’s what you need to know.

Vape vs. Cigarettes

Through the years, the tobacco industry has been trying to find ways to make cigarette smoking less dangerous. However, most of these efforts, such as added filters or “light cigarettes” were merely just marketing tactics. Smoking has not become any less harmful, so smokers are looking for alternatives.

One such alternative is vaping, which uses e-cigarettes to vaporize liquids within a cartridge and produce an inhalable aerosol (hence the term, vaping). Compared to traditional cigarettes that burn tobacco to produce smoke, vaping doesn’t use combustion, which means there are fewer chemicals and carcinogens that get formed and inhaled into the body.

Is Vape Safe?

According to a recent study, vaping is better than smoking and it can help smokers quit. When people inhale cigarette smoke, they’re taking nicotine and other burnt chemicals into their lungs and those chemicals enter the bloodstream and spread through your body.

With vaping, instead of burning tobacco leaves to release nicotine, vapes (or e-cigarettes) use batteries to heat the nicotine-containing liquid to an aerosol. As such, levels of these toxicants are fewer with vaping.

Vaping Health Effects

While vaping is generally safer and a better option compared to cigarettes, this doesn’t mean that there are no vape health risks.

People who are into dual-use -- smoking and vaping, are at a higher risk. There’s also a growing number of younger people (particularly adolescents) who are getting into vaping.
