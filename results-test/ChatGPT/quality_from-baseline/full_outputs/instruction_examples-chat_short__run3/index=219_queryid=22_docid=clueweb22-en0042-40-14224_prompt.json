Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

2 state solution pros:

Both entities get their presumably agreed on lands to build their states.

2 state cons:

A lot of land is extremely disputed and claimed by both, some of which is impossible to divide - for example, East Jerusalem and Al Alsa/Temple Mount. Both sides claim both and both sides refuse to negotiate on it.

1 state pros:

None. Simply won’t work since Isralis won’t accept an Arab majority, an rightfully so. We’ve consistently (and regretfully) demonstrated we’re ready to cleanse the levant of Jews before, why should they trust us now?

Jews lose their state, bad for them, good for us for perhaps 6 months, after which we slide into 3rd world country akin to Gaza, so it’s bad for us as well.

In spite of the ongoing failed negotiations and disputes, in fact, either solution would have been…well…a solution.

But both would be a disaster for Israel. The two state solution would mark out boundaries (presumably at the 1967 “green line”) and prevent further expansionism of Israel - and undo the tons of new settlements already built in Palestinian land. Israel would either have to turn them over to Palestinians (unlikely) or demolish them. And all the illegal settlers would have to move back into legal Israel (which would have to declare its boundaries).

And all the illegal settlers would have to move back into legal Israel (which would have to declare its boundaries).

The one-state solution, which at this point seems the only one remotely feasible, also would mean the ending of apartheid and the military occupation, and the granting of full citizenship to Palestinians. This would mean, of course, that Israel would no longer have a Jewish majority, i.e. a Jewish identity. Quel horreur!

In fact, whatever rationale the Israeli government uses — or what you believe — Israel wants fervently to avoid both solutions, and endeavors to keep the status quo, of a Jewish state in which Palestinians are irrelevant and preferably invisible.

This might sound unconventional, but hands down I’d go with blue-chip art. A Basquait painting soared 2,209,900% when it was bought for $5,000 and sold for $110,500,000. And if you think that is crazy, a Leonardo Da Vinci painting skyrocketed 5,328,894%. Although not guaranteed, if you can f

Let’s start with the 1-state solution: it is insane, and will not happen. Why?

  1. The Palestinians hate (or at least deeply dislike and distrust) the Jews, and have shown willingness to cleanse the levant of Jews (as some other answer here mentioned). It is unlikely they will settle comfortably into a state where half the population is Jews.
  2. The Jews under no circumstances will make so many Arabs into citizens. We do have experience with genocide, and believe the Palestinians (Hamas, anyone?) that they want to inflict one on us. We also the experience with Gaza, where we vacated in 2005, and never

  2. The Jews under no circumstances will make so many Arabs into citizens. We do have experience with genocide, and believe the Palestinians (Hamas, anyone?) that they want to inflict one on us. We also the experience with Gaza, where we vacated in 2005, and never got a moment of quiet after that.
  3. The status quo (as sad as it is) is much better the a 1-state solution. Actually, an Apartheid state (which is much worse than the status quo), or ethnic cleansing (arguably, even worse), are better than a 1-state solution.
  4. And don’t even think on forcing Israel into a 1-state solution. Between economic pain (which the world can inflict on Israel) and genocide (or at least a civil war), we will take economic pain every day.

A 2-state solution has the distinct advantage of being the only one with any possibility of working. If the two people are willing to keep to their side of the border, and not lobe bombs over it, all is good. Moreover, Israel has already shown ability to fulfill its peace agreements with Arab countries (Egypt and Jordan). Israel is (and will remain) much stronger militarily than any possible Palestinian state.

However:

  1. Despite being the underdog, the Palestinians have been willing to fight non-stop, when all it brings is misery for their population, and some limited pain to the Israelis.
  2. The Palestinians keep supporting organizations like Hamas, that are sworn to Israel destruction.
  3. The Palestinians are split into 2 major factions (and many minor ones), all fully armed, belligerent, and a deal with one (a big if), does not obligate any of the others.
  4. As a result for the Gaza unsuccessful disengagement, more and more Israeli Jews do not see a real possibility for peace, and will not want to take risks.

Bottom line: a 2-state solution is the only viable “democratic” / “desirable” one (ethnic cleansing and apartheid are also viable, but not democratic or desirable). Unfortunately, it is not likely to happen any time soon.

The con of the two state solution is that the train has left the station. The con of the single state model is that it will arrive de-facto, unplanned and unrecognuzed, like an unwanted and disowned child, and the process of straightening itself out without any help will in the worst case scenario drown the region in blood and in the best case would produce traumas for generations to come. There. I didn’t want to spell it out for you, but you asked.

Oh wait, you asked what would be the pros and cons for Israelis and Palestinians. In other words, you asked who would suffer more. It’s like asking

One state: (Looking at the condition of Israel and Palestine)

1. Palestinian Rule: Muslims will murder all the jews and try to establish Islamic rules destroying the freedom of everyone in the state.

2. Israel Rule: The state will progress like no other nation and will reach at the top giving the nation unprecedented wealth and freedom to live. Eventually most progressive and educated muslims will leave Islam and merge with the society further strengthening the country.

2. Israel Rule: The state will progress like no other nation and will reach at the top giving the nation unprecedented wealth and freedom to live. Eventually most progressive and educated muslims will leave Islam and merge with the society further strengthening the country.

Two State: Both the states will be in constant fear of war because Islamic Palestinians and nations (Iran, Pakistan etc.) do not consider Israel to be a legit country. Muslims will keep dying of poverty, malnutrition, illetracy and violence of their own leaders (HAMAS, HEZBOLLAH etc.).They will still keep blaming everyone except themselves for their condition. Israel will need to spend its resources on security which will hinder its progress.

We've put together a list of 8 money apps to get you on the path towards a bright financial future.

Short answer:

A one state solution would be the end of Israel being hollowed out from the inside.

A two state solution would bring constant terrorism to Israel, because the Muslim Arabs don't want Israel to be, want to destroy Israel and kill all Jews, worldwide.
