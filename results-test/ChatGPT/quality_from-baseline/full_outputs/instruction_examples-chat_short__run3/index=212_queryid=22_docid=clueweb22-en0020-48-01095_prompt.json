Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is there no solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? - Opinion - The Jerusalem Post

Is there no solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? - Opinion

ENCOUNTERING PEACE: Let’s not be mistaken: The lack of conflict resolution does not only hurt the Palestinians, it directly affects Israel as well.

The right-wing solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is: We have no solution. The forming of the current government of Israel was predicated on the modus operandi that there would be no solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for as long as the government exists. The right wing of the Israeli government is simply incapable of facing the reality of the existence of a Palestinian people.

There are some on the Right and on the Left who say there is no solution to this conflict. Those who understand the conflict in all its complexities say, under the present conditions, the prognosis is there will be constant waves of terrorism, which the State of Israel knows how to contain. There are some prescriptive alternatives to trying to resolve the conflict by using economics to subdue Palestinian national and religious aspirations (the latest alternative on the hit parade is referred to as shrinking the conflict) while continuing to employ the strong arm of the Israeli security services to preemptively arrest any suspects of terrorism (machabel chashud in Hebrew).

The Palestinian Authority’s security forces continue to comply with Israel’s demands for full security coordination and cooperation with the occupation. The more extreme ends of the right wing in Israel call for removing Palestinian residency rights, more home demolitions, expropriation of land and physical resettlement. On the ground, these actions are actually encouraged by extreme groups of ultra-violent settlers, mostly coming from illegal outpost settlements in the Hebron Hills, the Jordan Valley and around the West Bank. They have the tacit support of the Israeli army. In modern Hebrew this situation is called nihul hasichsuch (managing the conflict).

There are many throughout the entire spectrum of the right wing who continue to deny the existence of a Palestinian people and don’t believe that the 50% of the people who are not Jewish living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean have any national rights at all. A large number of the talk-backers to this column are from that group.

The more pragmatic elements within the right-wing talk about some form of autonomy for the Palestinians without territorial control, sovereignty, immigration rights, an army, or control over their external borders. Their model is more or less the one that has emerged from the Oslo Accords (1993), which instead of being a five-year interim arrangement has become a permanent political reality.

They call this less than a state. In reality, it has no resemblance to a state at all and falls far short of what would be acceptable to any Palestinian. No Israeli would ever agree to live under those terms either. The Israeli army is the legal sovereign in the occupied areas and has enabled hundreds of thousands of Israelis to live in those areas with a completely different legal and economic status than the millions of Palestinians living there. These Israelis have Israeli citizenship while many Palestinians do not. This resembles apartheid much more than any agreement of civil autonomy.

It is amazing that there are still people in Israel who continue to believe that there is no such thing as Palestine or the Palestinian people. It is equally amazing that there are Israelis who believe that the Palestinian people will acquiesce and simply give up their demand for self-determination. There are many in Israel, including the right wing members of the current Israeli government who believe that economic benefits granted to Palestinians, such as the right to work in Israel, will quell Palestinian aspirations and their right to resist the continued Israeli military occupation. They are wrong. The economic measures can delay an explosion, but they cannot prevent it.

There is a lull in political action by the international community and by the Palestinians themselves. This is due to the crisis of leadership among Palestinians, the divided Palestinian political house and the lack of political leadership in Israel willing to face the reality that this conflict cannot be managed for a never-ending period of time. Prime minister Naftali Bennett and his right-wing colleagues have declared without hesitation that they will not negotiate with the Palestinians. MK Yair Lapid has already declared that when he becomes prime minister, he too will not negotiate with the Palestinians. What hope and political horizon are the leaders of Israel leaving the Palestinians? Does anyone believe that the dream of every young Palestinian is to be a laborer in Israel?

Let’s not be mistaken: The lack of conflict resolution does not only hurt the Palestinians, it directly affects Israel as well. The continued occupation, its daily suffering felt by almost every Palestinian and the lack of hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict sends a clear message that the failure of the decades-long struggle for an independent Palestinian state means that the only option left is to fight for full equality in one state. While the international community and parts of the Israeli government cynically continue to parrot the mantra of the two-state solution without recognizing one of the two states, the Palestinian public is rapidly moving away from that political option.

The one-state reality on the ground will emerge as the only choice given to the Palestinians and eventually the international community will catch on. By that time, Israeli Jews will not be in the majority between the river and the sea (by many assessments that is already the case). Personally, I no longer have a problem with the possibility of Israel being the state of all of its citizens – including all of the Palestinians – but I don’t believe that is what the majority of Israelis want. The acceptance of the notion that the current Israeli government cannot negotiate with the Palestinians must be challenged. This is, in fact, the best government possible to reopen negotiations with the Palestinians because without the right wing engaged in actively framing the narrative no solution is possible.
