Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Blood Doping and Erythropoietin (EPO) Use Be Accepted in Sports?

General Reference (not clearly pro or con)

Elizabeth Quinn, exercise physiologist, in a Mar. 26, 2020 article, “Erythropoietin (EPO) and Blood Doping in Sports,” available at verywellfit.com, stated:

“Blood doping refers to any attempt to improve athletic performance by artificially increasing your red blood cell count. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen molecules throughout the body. The more red blood cells you have, the greater your energy expenditure and the slower you will “burn out” during extreme physical activity.

Methods of blood doping include:
–Transfusions of someone else’s blood
–Re-infusion of one’s own red blood cells
–Administration of enhancement drugs such as EPO

Blood doping is in violation of standards set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and is banned in professional sports. Even with rigorous testing among athletes, that hasn’t stopped some from doing it anyway…

EPO has been banned since the early 1990s, but the first tests did not become available until the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Abuse of EPO made world headlines when Floyd Landis, the 2006 Tour de France winner, was stripped of his title after testing positive for doping…

EPO is a naturally occurring hormone that can be synthesized in the lab and injected directly into the skin or bloodstream. In terms of sports performance, it has been shown to increase the proliferation of red blood cells and increase the amount of oxygen carried to muscles.

Increased availability of oxygen is believed to slow the progression of muscle fatigue and increased endurance during performance athletic events…

EPO has been shown to induce hypertension (high blood pressure) by literally crowding plasma with excessive red blood cells. This serves to ‘thicken’ the blood, increasing vascular constriction and the overall blood pressure. Greater blood viscosity puts a strain on the heart, increasing the risk of blood clots, heart attacks, and stroke.”

Mar. 26, 2020

The Mayo Clinic, in a Dec. 4, 2020 article, “Performance-Enhancing Drugs: Know the Risks,” available at mayoclinic.org, stated:

“Erythropoietin [EPO] is a type of hormone used to treat anemia in people with severe kidney disease. It increases production of red blood cells and hemoglobin — the protein that carries oxygen to your body’s organs.

Taking erythropoietin improves the movement of oxygen to the muscles. Epoetin, a synthetic form of erythropoietin, is commonly used by endurance athletes…

Erythropoietin use among competitive cyclists was common in the 1990s and allegedly contributed to at least 18 deaths. Inappropriate use of erythropoietin may increase the risk of stroke, heart attack and blockage in an artery in the lung (pulmonary embolism).”
