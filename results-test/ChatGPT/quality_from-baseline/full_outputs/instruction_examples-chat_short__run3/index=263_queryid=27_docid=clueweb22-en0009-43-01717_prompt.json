Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

People consider their security to be of topmost priority and believe that they should be given maximum support from the state for the provision of measures for the maintenance of their safety and protection. The increases in the crime rate and incidents of violence have made individuals very concerned and this has led to their demands for the consideration of the relaxation of gun laws. They consider that gun control measures restrict their ways of defense and hence deprive them of leading a quality life as they are in constant fear of being subjected to acts of violence and crime.

The first ruling which was passed against the allowing of guns for personal use was given by the Supreme Court of the United States in the year 1939. The Court passed a decision that gun control measures are of immense importance for the security of the individuals (Associated Press 2007). This decision was passed in a time when the rate of crime and violence was very low and in that time period strict gun control laws were the most appropriate decision to uphold the peaceful environment and living of the individuals so as to avoid the falling of weapons in wrong hands.

This law prevented the easy availability of weapons and hence criminal groups could not flourish due to the ban on these weapons. The decision could have been the best one in those times owing to the fact that criminal offenses were not persisting at a very high rate in the society.With the changing times and the trends in society, this decision requires serious revision considering the happenings in society in today’s world. The crime rate has greatly increased and many innocent lives are lost owing to this surge in the criminal acts.

Many people are killed every day in acts of violence. These losses should not be ignored and this calls for proper measures for the security of human lives. It should be considered that so many losses can be avoided if certain laws are amended and revised.
