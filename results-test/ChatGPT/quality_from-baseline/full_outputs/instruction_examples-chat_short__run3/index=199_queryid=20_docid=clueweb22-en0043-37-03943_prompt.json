Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Can drinking human milk be considered cannibalism? - Quora
3 Answers

Milk isn’t really a part of people.

It’s a little murky on how to draw the line, but I doubt drinking pee, tears, piss or nut is really cannibalism since those aren’t integral to a person and are naturally expelled.

No. Cannibalism is eating the flesh of your own species. Milk is not meat. And humans are mammals. Drinking human milk is what humans are supposed to do (well, baby humans, anyhow — most adults are lactose intolerant).

NO! Cannibalism is consuming the flesh of a human, not the mammary secretions. All mammals consume the mammary secretions of their mothers, from apes to zebras.

Benefits for the Mammal (Human female)

How breastfeeding benefits Woman's health

Oxytocin also has an antidepressant effect. One study found that mothers who had higher levels of the hormone had fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. In fact, for as long as you continue to breastfeed, oxytocin will help you feel calm, reduce stress and blood pressure, and even raise your pain threshold.

The longer you continue to breastfeed, the more health benefits you’ll enjoy. “There are so many advantages for mums,” says Professor Hartmann. “Breastfeeding lowers your lifelong risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Every extra month that you breastfeed also reduces your risk of a number of cancers, including those of the breast, ovaries and uterus.”

How breastfeeding can help you lose weight

If you’ve ever wondered how many calories are burned breastfeeding, the answer is up to 500 a day18 – about the same as an hour-long bike ride. And if you’re pumping breast milk the results should be similar. These extra calories burned with breastfeeding can help you shed any weight you’ve put on during pregnancy. Or alternatively, it might just let you get away with eating a few extra cakes and biscuits!

You may have to be a bit patient, too, as Professor Hartmann explains: “Lactating women can lose body weight when they’re breastfeeding, but mostly that takes a while. You have to breastfeed past the six-month period to really get some benefit of weight the loss.”

Why breastfeeding saves you money

A lactating woman has the tendency to produce sufficient milk for the family use. Ss human mammal's breasts works according to demand and supply system. The more she pumps out or gets her breasts suckled with intervals, the more milk her body will make . Thou , a woman can not produce milk for commercial use, but she has the tendency to produce enough milk atleast for her family's personal use.

Breast milk is available 24/7 and the most important and noticeable point is, Completely Free, which is a big saving for a family.

When do the health benefits of breastfeeding end?

They don’t! Believe it or not, you could still be reaping the rewards of breastfeeding now in your twilight years. “Breastfeeding improves bone mineralisation, so you’ll be less likely to suffer from osteoporosis and fractures in later life if you breastfeed, explains Professor Hartmann.

Breastfeeding can even boost your brainpower: “Putting it simply, breastfeeding improves a mum’s IQ,” says Professor Hartmann. “women undergo alterations in their brains that mean they can undertake some tasks more effectively.” So if you feel like a superwoman now you’re a superwoman!

Breastfeeding from the source, increase blood flow in women and that is very good for health of woman's heart as well as for her skin.

Human being every organ is for some purpose, if the part if the body is stopped deleberatly functioning then sooner or later that part of the body shall create problems.

I hope the above details shed light on importance of breastmilk as well as its benefits for both

Not really drink but taste.

I breastfed all my three children and when I was lactating my eldest son, my cousin also had her baby, just a week older than my son.

However, her daughter was never breastfed as according to my cousin, her daughter pushed her tongue out everytime she tried to breastfeed her.

My cousin asked if I can try to breastfeed her daughter as it amazed her how my son was nourished through my milk.

When we tried, her daughter sucked for a long time and she seemed to be satisfied.

My cousin said her milk tasted a bit salty so she asked for a drop of my milk to check. She was surpri

My cousin said her milk tasted a bit salty so she asked for a drop of my milk to check. She was surprised that it tasted sweet. I got curious too so I took out a few drops and indeed my milk tasted sweet.

Well, I am thankful that I could breastfeed my children for three years each and I have donated a lot of milk to the hospital when I worked in the nursery as a nurse.

Aside from that, I gave my milk to impoverished and malnourished kids from poor families in some communities. Their mothers were malnourished too so they couldn’t provide milk.

Having been blessed with abundant milk is something to be thankful for and I was glad to share to many children aside from mine.

YES!!!! Ask her. You won’t know if she’s ok with it unless you ask her. Hold off on doing it after she has the baby for the first 6 weeks so baby can get all the colostrum. But before and after those weeks, yes! My husband and I enjoy the whole breast lactating thing! 😉👍 also when I didn’t have a pump near by he would help me relieve some of the pressure and he liked the taste of it! 😂😂

Mostly in bed for the night my husband cuddles me a drinks from my breasts.

I have thought about this question a lot and tried to figure out my emotions.

I have mommy feelings over him and they may be odd but, ownership of him is another way to say it.

I feel endeared to him, and that he protects his family, and I am there for his need at night.

Im aroused by it, greatly. It doesnt feel like a mother/son relationship but a deep natural sense of nurturing that men could likely not appreciate. Im not a guy so i dont know.

He has fallen asleep on my nipple and that makes me feel an odd sense of love t
