You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Electronic cigarettes, vaping devices

Battery-powered E-cigarettes (e-cigs), vaporizers, vape pens, atomizers, electronic nicotine delivery systems

Electronic smoking devices when carried by passengers or crewmembers must be carried on one's person or in carry-on baggage. Electronic smoking devices are battery powered and have a heating element that vaporizes liquid. Passengers are required to take effective measures for preventing accidental activation of the heating element of the device when transporting the devices.

Examples of effective measures to deactivate the device include, but are not limited to: Removing the battery from the electronic smoking device; separating the battery from the heating coil; placing the electronic smoking device into a protective case; using a protective cover, safety latch, or locking device on the electronic smoking device's heating coil activation button; and electronics or technology in the device designed to prevent accidental activation, such as those requiring the electronic smoking device to be powered on before the heating coil button can be activated.

Spare lithium batteries also must be carried on one's person or in carry-on baggage and must be individually protected so as to prevent short circuits. Battery terminals (usually the ends) must be protected from short circuit (i.e., the terminals must not come in contact with other metal). Methods include: leaving the batteries in their retail packaging, covering battery terminals with tape, using a battery case, using a battery sleeve in a camera bag, or putting them snugly in a plastic bag or protective pouch.

Each battery must not exceed 100 Wh for lithium ion batteries or 2 grams for lithium metal batteries. Recharging of the devices and/or the batteries on board the aircraft is not permitted.

Check with your airline on any limitations on the number of devices that can be carried for personal use by a passenger.

See the regulations: 49 CFR 175.10(a)(19)
