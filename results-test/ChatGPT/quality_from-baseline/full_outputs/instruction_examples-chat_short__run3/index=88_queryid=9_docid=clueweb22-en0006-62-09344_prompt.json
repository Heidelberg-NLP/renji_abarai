Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

  • Its much better because

    Students wuldnt buy many clothes and waist their money on alot of clothes, Reason 1, Reason 2 is students may waist their time on choosing an outfit because there is alot of clothes, Reason 3, Students may get lost outside the school like in field trips or something else, Uniforms are much better.

  • Uniforms should be mandatory

    What is wrong with it? It provides one with a sense of discipline which is what we learn in school. You are showing the respect towards your school and one knows that you are from this school. It shows that we are united in spirit. It shall also display us a sense of identity and school pride.

  • Uniforms should be required

    Uniforms should be required to prevent bullying over the newest sneakers and hottest jacket. They save the student time in the morning when choosing what to wear and the parents money because 4 pants and 5 shirts will last a school year. It also pushes students to express themselves and show their uniqueness in new ways like writing, singing, dancing, sports, etc.

  • Students should be able to wear uniforms

    As i have heard before and i will say, students with uniforms don't need to worry about being picked on for what they wear. Lots of kids i know wake up 30 minutes earlier just to pick out the "right" outfit for the day. With my opinion i think that schools should choose uniforms to release the stress of picking out clothing for the day. I can see how the other side looks at the situation though, i know lots of people want the right to pick out their clothing and i respect that. I do want to say one last thing though, with uniforms you only have to pay for one set of clothes (or two, depending on P.E.) and you don't have to constantly buy new clothes for school each year.

  • Schools should be required to wear uniforms

    Schools should be required to wear uniforms because it causes less teasing about what the student chooses to wear. It also gives the student more focus on their schools work instead of worrying about what they wear or how they look like. Furthermore, buying individual clothing pieces may cost more money to be spent, but if a uniform is bought, less money is spent on buying clothes.

  • Schools should require students to wear uniforms

    Schools should require students to wear uniforms. This is because of the fact that there have been studies on students who wear school uniforms versus students who follow a dress code or none, and the results have shown that the students are more obedient, less distracted, and less unruly when they wear uniforms.

  • Uniforms Are Better

    I believe schools should require uniforms for students. I think this makes it easier for the students and can help create a more neutral environment. People often say that uniforms cost to much money, but this simply isn't true. Shirts are generally sold for $8-$15 dollars and the slacks can be found for the same price as jeans.
