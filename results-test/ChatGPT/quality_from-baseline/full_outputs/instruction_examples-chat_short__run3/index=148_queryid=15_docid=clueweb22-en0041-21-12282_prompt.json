Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Why Animal Testing Should Not Be Banned

Every year, millions of animals were suffering or killed due to scientific research. Some animal rights groups suggest that we should ban animal experiments because use animals for experimentation is cruel and animals should have the same right of living as human beings. A report from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that more than 100 million animals are killed in U.S. laboratories for biology lessons, medical experimentation, and chemical, drug, food, and cosmetics testing. There are some other people believe that the death of animals will help and save millions of human lives. Personally I believe that the experimentation on animals for scientific and medical should not be stopped.

The contribution of animal testing is significance. A report from California Biomedical Research Association states that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example Diabetics used to be the disaster to humans before the insulin was found. Frederick G. Banting solved this problem by doing

The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) of United States gives some protections to warm-blooded animals used in research laboratories, which only cover 5% of animals normally used for testing. Under AWA, all testing on animals which are covered must minimized the pain on animals and provide appropriate veterinary care. The AWA should make further improvements which cover as much animals as possible. In UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 defined regulated procedures as animal experiments that could potentially cause "pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm”. It prevents animals from unnecessary suffering. Actually all testing and research done on animals should be under the control of government. The last and the most things is that it’s our responsibilities to take care of all the animals, even though they are just using for
