The essay presents both the sides of the arguments and provides relevant examples and references to support them. The essay argues that while insider trading can be beneficial to investors by speeding up market efficiency, it is still an illegal and unethical act. The essay also highlights the legal aspects of insider trading and the vague ethical dilemmas it poses. The author concludes the essay by suggesting that the laws should be revised to allow insiders to make their trades known to the public to ultimately benefit the market."
