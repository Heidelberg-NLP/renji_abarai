Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

In the wake of the 2015 Obergefell same-sex marriage ruling, political and cultural opposition to religion has ramped up, with some calling for the revocation of tax-exempt status for religious entities. A 2020 presidential hopeful unabashedly promised that any religious institution that does not fully embrace the LGBT agenda would lose its tax-exemption if he were elected. In light of those pronouncements, let’s take a look at why tax exemptions for religious entities exist, and why they should remain in place. 

Historical background

Federal tax exemptions for religious donations date back to the First World War. To fund the war, the federal income tax top rate was raised significantly, but to ease fears that charitable giving would dry up because of the higher taxes, Congress added the exemption. It was not a baseless fear. The data bear this out. For example, tax law changes in 2017 that doubled the standard deduction provided a disincentive for those who itemize deductions, and charitable giving flattened out, after years of successive increases. 

State tax exemptions go back to colonial times.

How large is charitable giving in the United States? Giving USA reports that American individuals, bequests, foundations and corporations gave an estimated $427.71 billion to U.S. charities in 2018. Not all of that goes to religious institutions, of course, but a significant portion does.

There Are Social Benefits for The Common Good

Churches and religious organizations, like other charities, provide a social benefit to society. They minister to the needy and poor in their communities, and they provide an influence on society that helps to reduce crime and encourage good citizenship. The links below are to articles and information that quantify some of the benefits that churches provide:

The Separation of Church and State Is Maintained

Making churches and other religious organizations tax exempt is the cleanest way to avoid government entanglement with (and exercising undue influence over) religion, which is prohibited by the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion…” As Chief Justice John Marshall stated back in 1819, “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.” Keeping churches tax exempt removes the temptation from government to interfere with the free exercise of religion, also guaranteed by the First Amendment. In 1970, the U.S. Supreme Court held that property tax exemptions for churches were in keeping with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. (Walz v. Tax Commission) 

Churches Would Close

Many small churches cannot afford to stay open without the benefits of tax-exempt status. The median church in the U.S. has 75 regular participants in worship on Sunday morning. From encouraging donations to having enough income to pay the pastor’s salary, those familiar with the finances of small churches know that losing tax-exempt status would spell the end for many churches operating on a shoe-string budget. In small towns across America, where small churches are the norm and central to community activities, this could mean depriving some populations any organized churches whatsoever.

Tax Exemption Is a Founding Principle

By the time of the American Revolution, nine of the original thirteen colonies were giving some kind of tax relief to churches. The idea can be traced back to Roman times when Emperor Constantine granted the Christian church a complete exemption from all forms of taxation.

Tax-exempt status for churches and religious organizations serves a continuing social benefit to American society and is consistent with our country’s commitment to keep the government from unnecessary entanglements with religion. It is a policy that is in keeping with the best social and constitutional traditions of this nation.
