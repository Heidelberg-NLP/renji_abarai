Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

There are 79 new community cases on Tuesday, with four of these being in Waikato.

According to the Ministry of Health's latest 1pm update, there were 10,660 doses of the Pfizer vaccine administered nationally on Monday, with just 4937 being in Auckland.

It comes as students in years 11 to 13 return return to onsite learning on Tuesday in preparation for exams. But not every school is opening their doors, with some saying their community is too vulnerable to have students back in large gatherings.

9:10pm - About 40 percent of New Zealand's workforce will need to be fully vaccinated after the Government announced a sweeping vaccine mandate on Tuesday afternoon.

The compulsory vaccinations apply to businesses like hospitality, retail, hairdressers and gyms.

Basically if under the traffic light system the business uses vaccine passports then all staff will need to get two jabs.

The Prime Minister says if a customer has to be vaccinated, staff should be too. And she has signalled there could be more mandates to come for the public sector.

8:40pm - Several Waikato mayors have banded together to call for the region's district health board to improve its vaccination drive and consult better with those on the ground.

Locals are increasingly frustrated that the region remains in the strictest version of level 3.

"We need to have a more coordinated approach," Waipa District Mayor Jim Mylchreest says.

"Councils are sitting waiting to help. We've got the local contacts, we can assist the hospital board - we are not being asked to."

He's supported by Ōtorohanga Mayor Max Baxter and Waikato District Mayor Allan Sanson.

8:10pm - One of today's positive cases is in the town of Waiuku, on the outskirts of Auckland.

But news of the case hasn't shocked locals, one of whom says it was "inevitable" the virus would reach them.

"It's just another day in Waiuku and life goes on," they told Newshub.

"It's everywhere, isn't it. It's going to go everywhere so the best thing to do is just get get vaccinated," another said.

Waiuku Health Centre announced its first positive test result today, saying it is a household contact of another recent case.

The swab was taken on Saturday. The person didn't enter the building but was tested outside in their car. All staff were wearing PPE.

The centre has increased swabbing capacity and says anyone who needs a test should book an appointment.

Clinical lead, Dr Lychhun Kouch, said they were twice as busy as usual today.

"We did roughly maybe 150 today, normally we do about 80."

He said everyone's thoughts are with the family.

Waiuku College had been due to reopen today but remained closed for now "to alleviate any stress and confusion in the community".

7:50pm - National's COVID-19 response spokesperson Chris Bishop says it's time to end "the lottery of human misery" that is MIQ.

"More than 100 people with COVID are isolating at home in Auckland right now, yet fully vaccinated travellers with no COVID have to spend 14 days in MIQ. This system makes no sense. It is unfair and illogical," he says.

"Data I revealed last week shows that fully vaccinated travellers to New Zealand present a negligible risk to the community, particularly a community with COVID already circulating. Just two out of thousands of fully vaccinated travellers to New Zealand have tested positive for COVID in MIQ on day eight or later since August 23."

Bishop says thousands of New Zealanders have been shut out of the country thanks to the "inequitable lottery" and the Government needs to make "substantial changes" to the system.

"A good place to start would be to implement National's plan of fully vaccinated travellers with negative pre-departure tests and negative post-arrival tests being allowed to either isolate at home for a week (from medium-risk jurisdictions) or be free to go without self-isolation altogether," he says.

"National's plan would allow thousands of Kiwis to come home for Christmas, reuniting families and boosting tourism and business.

"It's time to reopen New Zealand to the world. We can't remain stuck in isolation forever. It's time to start tearing down the barriers of Fortress New Zealand and bring Kiwis home."

7:20pm - Professor Nikki Turner, director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre at the University of Auckland, says since New Zealand has chosen to have a broader vaccine mandate, this needs to work with balanced supportive strategic approaches.

She says international evidence for the effectiveness of vaccination mandates is mixed - if they are poorly directly, implemented in isolation, or without supportive community approaches in place, they are at risk of backfiring by polarising communities, creating entrenched attitudes and potentially marginalising further.

"It is vital that we continue to focus on genuinely listening to local communities and the range of reasons why some are not taking up vaccination options, and being compassionate to the historic and current reasons behind why some communities have lower trust and lower engagement with health services to avoid wherever possible further marginalisation," she says.

"The recently announced extra funding into local service delivery particularly for Māori communities is important to allow communities to create their own solutions with their own local health services. Successful immunisation uptake across multiple diverse communities is a complex balance."

6:45pm - Auckland hospitals may start discharging COVID-positive patients as the system reaches "tipping point".

The region's hospitals have been told COVID-positive patients can now be sent home as long as they can leave hospital without spreading the virus to others.

"The system is tipping into community management because of the high number of cases we're now seeing with COVID," says Royal NZ College of GPs medical director Dr Bryan Betty.

"If that continues to increase, this trend will continue so it is a very, very fast-moving situation at this point."

6:10pm - National is calling on the Government to ditch vaccine certificates after 90 percent of the eligible population has been vaccinated against COVID-19. 

Judith Collins, who earlier on Tuesday said she supported vaccine certificates but also didn't want "two classes of people" in society, later added that she believes the certificates should no longer be required once 90 percent of the eligible population is jabbed.

"The National Party doesn't agree with the Government in their plan to impose restrictions with the mandatory use of vaccine certificates after we have hit their vaccine target of 90 percent across all DHBs," Collins said. 

"Once the target is achieved, National supports the existing rights of all private businesses to choose who they do business with. Some businesses will choose to require proof of vaccination. Others will not."
