Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

How can illegal immigrants sue the US government? - Quora
Data for the people. In-depth analysis of how each level of government is spending your money.

The duties owed by the U.S. and the rights that the government is obligated to protect belong to “persons” not “citizens.” Illegal immigrants are law breakers at least with regard to our laws restricting immigration. However, they are persons. Thus they can sue the government where government power is used to infringe upon the rights of persons.

Sue the US government for what? For having the gall to actually enforce their immigration laws?

For what being illegals? Certainly not successfully if there is some idea about their detention being so difficult for them. They adopted the risks when they knowingly staged a bum rush on the border. I’d love to be a juror on such a case.

They are not immigrants. If I go to any country I'm an Alien. I'm only an immigrant if I give up my citizenship from one country then get legal citizenship in another country . And yes they are ILLEGAL. Not undocumented. To become undocumented you need a document like your passport then your in another country then get a warrant in another country then immigration in the country your in takes your passport then your undocumented. Anyone can sue. That don't mean your going to win.

What makes you think they shouldn’t?

My dad once told me…the law is: ANYONE can sue ANYONE in the US (and they often do). You only need a lawyer who thinks they might be able to win your suit. There is no stipulation that the plaintiff must be a legal resident of the US.

The reason courts aren’t MORE overrun with litigious people suing each other is this: Some lawyers simply won’t take on a case, because they know they will lose.

For what? You have to have something to sue for. Can’t sue for coming across illegally and not liking your living conditions in a cell when you broke the law in the first place.

You’ve done it. You’ve built up a little cushion in your bank account — $1,000! It feels good, right? Those days of checking your account balance in a panic are behind you. But, there are six moves you should make once your bank account gets past this magical number. ​​1. Invest in Famous A

Illegal aliens are “persons” under the Constitution the same as permanent resident aliens, naturalized citizens and people born in this country. They have all of the constitutional rights of any other person.

In one case involving illegal alien children attending public schools, the Supreme Court held that illegal alien children are a protected class along with classes such as race and religion. That means the government, state and federal, must show that any law based on that classification of people is subject to strict scrutiny to determine if it is constitutional.

They sure can, however, unless they are suing them for not being deported fast enough, I’m not sure what they sue about.

The United States government operates within the legal jurisdiction of the United States and it’s various states. Therefore, when the US government, or agent thereof, commits a violation of US law, it can be held accountable under those laws. The US Constitution proscribes that all persons receive equal protection under the law, so any person that has standing may sue the US government when it may have violated US law (which includes treaties to which the US is a party).

If there’s a claim that the US government violated US law, and those affected by that violation are illegal immigrants, then

Think about that for a moment.

Now consIder asking if it is illegal to employ illegal immigrants in the USA. The answer to that question is YES. Why is that not enforced?

This post has turned out to be rather long. Sorry about that. But if you will read to the end, you will see how it is that Latino labor is so treasured in this country, even if the workers are undocumented.

I operated a landscape business for 20 years. I had a lot of Hispanic workers in that time. But my business attorney guided me through the process so as not to trample the rights of any Hispanic that was perfectly legal to work in the U.S.

I’m not familiar with E-verfy. For me at that time, I was required to submit the proper tax forms (W2s, I9s etc) and Social Security information just like

I’m not familiar with E-verfy. For me at that time, I was required to submit the proper tax forms (W2s, I9s etc) and Social Security information just like I would with any worker. If the worker was undocumented, his/her paperwork would be bogus. In about three to four months, I would get a letter from the Social Security Administration explaining that my employee’s SS number did not match any of their numbers on file. We called this a “No-Match” letter. I was then t
