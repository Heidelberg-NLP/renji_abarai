Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Standardized Testing Policy

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NYU has modified  its testing requirements for the 2022-2023 application cycle for first-year and transfer applicants.

NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university, including an extension of our test-optional policy we have implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students who elect to submit testing as part of their application for Fall 2023 admission should submit one of the following:

All applicants must meet our English language testing requirements.

SAT

SAT tests should be taken in advance of NYU's application deadline if they are to be considered as part of your application. While we aim to  consider scores received after our application deadline, we cannot guarantee that we will wait for those scores to arrive before making an admission decision. 


NYU will accept test scores reported by the student for application review. Upon admission and matriculation we require official scores be sent to us electronically from The College Board. NYU’s school code is:

  • SAT: 2562

If you’ve taken the SAT more than once we will review the highest combination of SAT scores you submit.

ACT

ACT tests should be taken in advance of NYU's application deadline, if it is to be considered as part of your application. While we aim to  consider scores received after our application deadline, we cannot guarantee that we will wait for those scores to arrive before making an admission decision.

NYU will accept test scores reported by the student for application review. Upon admission and matriculation we require official scores be sent to us electronically from ACT. NYU’s school code is:

  • ACT: 2838

If you’ve taken the ACT more than once, we will recalculate a new composite using the highest of each section, regardless of test date.

International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma

For many students, IB Diploma results will not be available prior to NYU’s application deadline. If this is the case for you, you must submit predicted scores through the Official Predictions Submission Response form (this unique form is sent to the school official/counselor after receipt of the School Report for any student opting to submit predicted exam results). We require predictions for 6 subjects for Full IB Diploma students, we do not require predictions for the Extended Essay or Theory of Knowledge (TOK).

Beginning in 2021, NYU will accept the Higher and Standard Levels of either Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches or Mathematics: Applications and Interpretation for any major at NYU. However, applicants applying into Math, Engineering, or Business programs are encouraged to take either the higher or standard level of Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches or Higher Level Mathematics: Applications and Interpretation.

If you are a school official/counselor and are unable to submit a School Report and/or the Official Predictions Submission Form on behalf of your student through the Common Application please email admissions.ops@nyu.edu

Note: While your offer of admission may be made based on your predicted IB results, we reserve the right to withdraw an offer of admission if your final Diploma results are not within an acceptable range of your predicted results.

SAT Subject Tests

If you choose to submit three (3) SAT subject test scores to fulfill the standardized testing requirement, you are required to send at least one (1) score from each of the following academic areas:

  • Literature & Humanities
  • Math & Science

The third Subject Test may be in any subject area.

Some of our schools have their own requirements for subject test results:

  • The Stern School of Business requires one of the subject exams to be Math Level 1 OR Math Level 2.
  • The Tandon School of Engineering requires one literature or humanities score, one math score, and one science score.

You can refer to the expandable below to see into which category each exam falls.

Other International Examinations

As part of NYU's Flexible Testing Policy, we accept dozens of examinations and other qualifications from around the world. The qualification must meet the following criteria:

  • It shows you completed, or if submitting predicted results show you will complete, your secondary education;
  • It was administered by an independent body (not your school); and
  • It was approved by NYU.

We understand that some examination results may not be available prior to NYU’s application deadline. If this is the case for you, you must submit predicted scores through the Official Predictions Submission Response form (this unique form is sent to the school official/counselor after receipt of the School Report for any student opting to submit predicted exam results).

If you are a school official/counselor and are unable to submit a School Report and/or the Official Predictions Submission Form on behalf of your student through the Common Application please email admissions.ops@nyu.edu:

Please remember: While your offer of admission may be made based on your predicted results, we reserve the right to withdraw an offer of admission if your final results are not within an acceptable range of your predicted results.

You can refer to NYU’s International Qualification Tool to see which examinations you are able to submit and the supporting documentation required.

Note: if any official documents are not in English, they must be accompanied by an official English translation, either issued by a school official or by a translation agency that is accredited in the country of the educational institution.

Common International Credentials

Artistic Programs

We believe that in attracting the most talented artists to Steinhardt and Tisch, an audition or portfolio, along with a student's academic record and engagement in activities, is a more effective gauge of potential student success in the arts than standardized testing. As a result, our evaluation process is based on one's academic record and artistic review of one's required audition or portfolio, along with other application materials including extracurricular experiences, recommendations, and essays.

All artistic programs in Steinhardt and Tisch require an audition or portfolio for admission, with the exception of Educational Theatre and Interactive Media Arts for which testing is required. All programs at NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai require testing.

If you are interested in being considered for alternate programs in addition to artistic programs at Steinhardt and Tisch, you will still need to submit testing to be eligible for admission to those programs.

If submitting standardized test scores is optional for your intended program of study and you do send us your test scores, we will consider them in our evaluation process.
