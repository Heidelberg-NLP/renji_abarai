Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Don't Be Skeptical...Protect Yourself with Safe Cell

Studies have shown that cell phone radiation and health hazards associated with cell phones are related to a wide range of health problems including headaches, pressure or tingling in the head, earaches, fatigue, brain tumors, DNA damage and even changes in the brain's electrical activity

Cell phones emit radiofrequency radiation (radio waves), a form of non-ionizing radiation, from their antennas. Parts of the body nearest to the antenna can absorb this energy. ... Over time, the number of cell phone calls per day, the length of each call, and the amount of time people use cell phones have increased. 

The WHO/International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, those used for cell phones, as possibly carcinogenic to humans, based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of bra Radiation from cell phones can possibly cause cancer, according to the World Health Organization.

A team of 31 scientists from 14 countries, including the United States, made the decision after reviewing peer-reviewed studies on cell phone safety. The team found enough evidence to categorize personal exposure as "possibly carcinogenic to humans." associated with wireless phone use. In another study, by Hardell, they looked at long-term use of cell and cordless phones. In conclusion it was found that, "this study confirmed previous results of an association between mobile and cordless phone use and malignant brain tumors.
