Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

In September 1970, the economist Milton Friedman wrote a seminal essay entitled “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.” Company leaders, Friedman argued, should be entirely concerned with making money for shareholders, not with their businesses’ environmental, social, or broader economic impacts.

Friedman’s tract was influential—and damaging. Over the ensuing five decades, corporations prioritized short-term profits even at the expense of their home countries, communities, and workers. CEO compensation at the top 350 U.S. firms rose by 940 percent in the four decades after 1978, compared with a 12 percent rise for the typical worker over the same period—a change driven by the idea that giving executives higher compensation would get the best performance. It is hard to believe that these dramatic financial incentives at the top have made much of a difference for the U.S. economy, looking at its performance before and since the mid-1970s. But the pay bump shouldn’t be a surprise. If greed is considered good, greed will become the new normal. The worldview Friedman advocated has undermined social norms that allowed the capitalist market system to work for the majority.

But as the essay has passed its 50th anniversary, Friedman’s doctrine might be in terminal decline. Amid the human and economic carnage of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extreme weather events of the last few years, sentiments in the financial markets appear to be shifting. In December 2020, for example, Engine No. 1, an environmentalist hedge fund, won three seats on ExxonMobil’s board after shareholders rebelled against the oil giant’s reluctance to reduce its carbon footprint. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank have asked financial institutions to conduct stress tests for different climate-related risk scenarios. The business world is also independently reevaluating its purpose. Klaus Schwab, chair of the World Economic Forum, wrote in Foreign Affairs in 2020 that companies must actively take “steps to meet social and environmental goals” or risk having “employees, clients, and voters . . . force change on them from the outside.”

There is certainly a great deal of interest among businesses in how to measure and report their societal impacts. Increasingly, companies are flocking to adopt voluntary standards for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, including those published by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. This means that in addition to reporting their financial returns, as publicly listed companies are already required to do, many businesses now attempt to measure and divulge how much carbon they emit, for example, or how much plastic they use, or how many people of color sit on their boards. These responsibility metrics become part of the profile of a corporation and can help attract or dissuade potential investors. Consequently, there is a rapidly growing industry of ESG advice from consultancies and think tanks, and it will probably not be long before regulators start to crystallize these metrics into a required standard.

Many corporations are not genuinely interested in bettering the world.

The movement toward ESG reporting certainly highlights important issues, such as climate change and the treatment of workers, and it is welcome that corporations want to engage in the debate. But the belief that companies can solve such pressing issues—through pursuing ESG standards or otherwise—is deeply flawed. Despite purportedly having good intentions, many corporations are not genuinely interested in bettering the world, and some use ESG metrics or other sustainability measures mainly to launder their reputations. Fixing some of the world’s most vexing problems will require that businesses dramatically alter their own practices, and it makes little sense to entrust systemic reform to the very institutions that themselves require change.

Instead, action must come from elsewhere: namely, governments. States must impose new regulations on the market economy to ensure that businesses are delivering shared productivity and social progress. Politicians will need to create laws that make markets work well and embed values—such as environmental sustainability or higher wages for low-income workers—that reflect the mainstream views of society. Renewed regulatory activism must include restoring competition through effective antitrust enforcement, legislating for the national interest over global profits, and tilting the balance of economic returns from older, wealthier generations to younger, poorer ones. It should also mean regulations to fight climate change, such as emission limits, mandates to end the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles, or bans on the use of certain materials.

This doesn’t mean that governments should discourage ESG standards and reporting. Officials should still urge manufacturers to disclose, say, the amount of pollution they produce and set reduction targets. But for the speed and scale of change that the world needs, states will have to force corporations to take steps that they would never agree to take on their own. The job of creating a more just and sustainable world cannot be outsourced to the private sector.

HOW NUMBERS LIE

At first glance, it seems possible that mandating ESG reporting would force businesses to be socially responsible. If corporations were required to disclose their societal and environmental impact, firms or people looking to invest in sustainable ways could make apples-to-apples comparisons and buy accordingly. Journalists might more easily scrutinize how companies affect their surrounding communities and the wider world. This could, in turn, incentivize executives to cut back on harmful corporate practices.

But the value of relying on required ESG reporting is questionable for several reasons. The first is temporal: the world’s problems are pressing, and it is still far from settled what the regulatory and governance framework for the corporation of the future will be. Laws move more slowly than public opinion, and although the intellectual case for a broader definition than Friedman’s of corporate purpose is advancing in the academic world, plenty of politicians and lawmakers (not to mention executives) have yet to be persuaded. Change in legislation and legal enforcement may be slow.

The second problem with mandated ESG reporting is more fundamental: the outcomes it aims to measure are broad and complex, whereas metrics are by definition tightly specified. There are inherent challenges in capturing complex, interrelated economic, social, and environmental phenomena—with all the nuances of interpretation involved—in easy-to-produce metrics. This means that even if states could quickly implement ESG requirements, it is unclear how useful they would be. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, to which much of ESG reporting is linked, clearly demonstrate the challenge. There are 17 of them, all worthy aims, including eliminating hunger, producing affordable and clean energy, and fostering responsible consumption and production. They are divided into 169 targets, measured by 232 indicators. But although progress on most (although not all) of them can be tracked, the monitoring is imperfect, and there are tradeoffs between many of the targets. This would also be the case for ESG targets. The costs companies incur in adopting new production methods for environmental reasons, for instance, might make it less likely that workers down the supply chain would receive wage increases.

Focusing on GDP harms the ability of governments to deliver prosperity.

Even when there are no tradeoffs between the targets, reductive metrics can have damaging consequences, as the political scientist James Scott explained in his masterly book Seeing Like a State. The social world, which is embedded in the natural environment, is messy and disorderly, and so imposing order through classification and measurement requires shaving off or tucking in many rough edges. Scott gives many examples of how this has backfired. To hit forest management targets, for example, Germany grew standard trees in ever more standard ways. Given the narrow criteria used to determine which forests were successful—namely the ease of controlling them and their ability to supply timber—this system made forests more productive and profitable at first. But it ultimately harmed biodiversity, and much of what was grown died in the longer term.

Similarly, the seven-decade-long practice of measuring economic activity in terms of GDP has led states to overlook some of the most important consequences of business and policy decisions. GDP is not a natural object; rather, it is an intellectual construct. For example, it decrees unpaid work in the home and natural environmental processes, such as pollination by bees and climate cooling by forests, as outside the economy because there are no market prices for them. As a result, the worlds of policymaking and scholarship have failed to see the importance of laws and regulations that would enable higher growth and living standards over time. Relying on this indicator alone harms the ability of governments to deliver prosperity.
