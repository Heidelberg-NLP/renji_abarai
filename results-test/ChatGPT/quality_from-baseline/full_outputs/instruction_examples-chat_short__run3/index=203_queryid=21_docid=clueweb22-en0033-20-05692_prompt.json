Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

HUMAN ACTIVITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE

WILLIAM WRIGHT
GRANTHAM UNIVERSITY

In this paper I will discuss Human Activity and Climate Change. I will discuss different human activities that might affect climate change, things such as the burning of fossil fuels and how they might contribute to climate change. To begin I will discuss what the definition of climate change. Climate change is the change in the atmosphere by the amounts of carbon dioxide levels that come from using fossil fuels. Climate change can occur when the Earth’s atmosphere become warmer than what it naturally should be. Affects that can happen from climate change is extreme weather change which can cause flooding in areas that it has not flooded before as well as drought and glaciers to melt as well as cause the environment to change. A lot of climate change is directly due to human activity; one of the activities that humans have done is released large amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which is a greenhouse gas that comes from burning fossil fuels. Greenhouse gases have wrapped around the earth’s surface like an extra blanket causing the Earth to heat up much more and affecting the balance of nature. Greenhouse gases are not only limited to large factories but also the amount of vehicles on the road; cars produce carbon dioxide as well. History has shown that the choices that we make can affect us on a large scale to include changing our environment as well as our climate.
