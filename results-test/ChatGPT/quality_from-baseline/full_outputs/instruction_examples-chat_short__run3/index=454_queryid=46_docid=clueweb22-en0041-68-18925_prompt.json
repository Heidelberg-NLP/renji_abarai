Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

FCC chairwoman tells Republicans she won’t cave on net neutrality

Republicans told Jessica Rosenworcel last year they didn't want net neutrality rules to be restored.

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel told a group of Republicans that she still supports net neutrality rules despite their efforts to push her to keep the repeal of them on the books.

In April last year, a group of 26 Republicans, led by Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) sent a letter to Rosenworcel—then the acting chair of the agency—where they said they were opposed to having the FCC’s 2017 repeal of net neutrality reversed.

The Republicans filled their letter with numerous arguments against net neutrality rules that have been pushed for years, including that they preferred “light touch” regulation and that the 2015 Open Internet Order hurt broadband investment. That argument has been criticized and debunked by net neutrality advocates.

Last week, Rosenworcel responded to their letter and made it clear: she supports net neutrality and that “returning to that successful framework is the strongest foundation for the internet economy as a whole.”

Rosenworcel was confirmed for another term at the FCC in December and was named the chair of the agency by President Joe Biden after serving in an acting capacity since early last year.

“It is unfortunate that individual states have had to fill the void left behind after the misguided rollback of the Commission’s net neutrality policies. I stand ready to work with Congress on this topic, as necessary. However, I continue to support net neutrality and believe that the Commission has the authority to adopt net neutrality rules,” Rosenworcel wrote in her response to the Republicans.

While Rosenworcel has long been a vocal advocate for net neutrality under Title II of the Communications Act, the FCC will need a third Democratic vote if it seeks to restore the rules.

Biden nominated Gigi Sohn, a prominent public interest advocate who has drawn rave reviews from net neutrality supporters, to fill the fifth and final spot at the agency late last year. While Sohn had a confirmation hearing, she did not receive a vote in either the Senate committee or the full Senate by the end of the year. Because of that, Biden re-nominated Sohn on Tuesday.

If and when Sohn is confirmed, the FCC would have a 3-2 Democratic majority, giving it the needed votes to restore net neutrality.
