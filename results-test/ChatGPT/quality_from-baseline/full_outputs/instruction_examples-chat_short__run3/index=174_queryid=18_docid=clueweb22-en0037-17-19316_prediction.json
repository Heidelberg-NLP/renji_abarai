The text provides arguments for these institutions to be tax-exempt and provides information on how they are differentiated under the tax law. The text also suggests why a church law attorney is important for these religious organizations, providing reasons such as navigating compliance and protecting their rights. Overall, the text is well-written with a good structure and provides informative content. I would label it as \"high\"."
