Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should the death penalty be legal? | Debate.org
  • Empathy towards the victim's family

    Think about it. It is not fair to the family if the person who raped or murdered their kid gets to live a life in jail why their kids are traumatized for the rest of their life or worse, dead. Honestly, death penalty should be legalized because of the proverb, "eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."

  • People have been MURDERED.

    Death penalty should be legal, for murdering and raping at least. What happens is that some people, whilst robbing or committing crimes, murder people. Sometimes people murder on on purpose! Why? Hatred? Personal revenge? Even then murdering is still wrong. Just imagine, someone murders, goes to jail, comes out, murder again. These people should be hanged to death! I mean, why should someone be allowed to play sports, read books, even LIVE, when they have taken a life away from someone else? As for the raping, it's worse than murdering. Invading someone's privacy. Actually it's demolishing a human right! Would you be able to live with that on your conscience? I wouldn't.

  • Kathlynn Shepard's murder

    Yes, the man killed himself, but before then he was in prison for kidnapping and rape before. While also being linked to two other girls. He was let out early, and because of this, two more girls were abducted, and one was murdered before her time. The fear of most children has risen, as well as fear for parents whom have young girls. This is not fair that this man was let out early and a young girl was taken from this world. He should have been put to death for the first two, instead of having the luxury of being able to end his own life, on his terms. This does not give the families the justice they deserve, instead gives them a larger heart ache. Being the oldest sister of six, and one of the twins being molested at 8 months makes my heart break, especially since this man was never caught.

  • yes, it should be legal

    The death penalty serves justice. If you think that you have the right to end someone's life, you deserve the death penalty. If you don't have respect for someone else's life then you don't deserve the right to die. Our jails are for people who commit small crimes. Our tax money should go toward keeping death sentenced people alive.

  • Justice must be served.

    In this time of vagrant disrespect for the law we need the death penalty. Way too many times justice is not served and people get away with murder. The legal system is too lenient and does not let the criminal pay the price of the crime which was committed. Too many times instead of the death penalty the criminals lawyer fights for a more lenient sentence such as life imprisonment instead of the death penalty.

  • Death penalty should be legal everywhere!!

    Yes I believe the death penalty should be legal because if you kill someone you shouldn't be able to just go to jail. You should have the same punishment as the crime you committed. There has been some cases where the criminal gets off on parole. Also they could be stuck on death row for max 20 year!

  • Death Penalty Should be legal.

    Death penalty has been used throughout history as a way to punish individuals that have committed certain crimes. In the recent years, through research, accuracy in one receiving the death penalty has increased. Many things have been discovered by Psychologists,involving things such as why innocent people confess.Laws have been made to prevent the innocent from being executed. There was a time when innocent people confessed to murder because of brainwashing incidents. With the increase of knowledge , and more laws added concerning the death penalty, those individuals sentenced to death have actually committed the crime they have been punished for. Each individual in the United States has been educated abut the death penalty and crimes that have capital punishment.With the increase in knowledge, he decrease in sentencing innocent people to death, the death penalty is fair.

  • Yes, it should be legal

    I think if you kill someone, especially if it it premeditated, you should be killed too. Yes, it is somewhat harsh, but killers should not be living and have a possibility to escape prison, and get to eat, sleep, and other activities in prison. People in poverty have it worse than them, and they didn't comit a cold blooded crime. Also, tax payers should not have to pay for them to live and be supported in jail. An argument comes up that they don't learn their lesson just dying,but the suspense and ultimate fear they get when sitting on that table with the needle in their arm, the fear is unbearable.

  • Yes, it should be legal

    I say that the death penalty should be legal because of how our justice system works nowadays. It happens way too often, where a murderer will NOT serve their entire sentence due to good behavior. A few cases have been where a person had a life sentence got out on parole. This SHOULD NOT be okay, and It's not acceptable. The death penalty should be for those criminals who commit terrible crimes, like murder in cold blood and murderers who killed a lot of people.

  • Yes

    I strongly agree with enforcing the death penalty in all states. I believe if you kill someone or cause bodily harm that results in death or a severe loss of quality of life, you should also be sentenced to death. The only problem is that many people who are on death row in states where it is legal sit on death row for 20 years. So that being said the system should be fixed as well. Life is prison sometimes is too good for the disgusting people who kill others. I say make the death penalty enforced everywhere.

  • Ban the death penalty.

    The death penalty should be banned! All life is important. It's just not right. God made that person for some reason, we just have to figure that out. Also, it costs more to kill a criminal with the death penalty than to keep them in jail. Think about your dad, mom, siblings, or anyone close to you being killed, not just by a criminal but by the government.

  • Death Penalty is against the Constitution!

    The constitution of the United States has always paraded the words, "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness." I believe this should extend to even the worst of the worst. Under no circumstances should ANY higher authority take away the life of another human being unless it is consensual. Even the government. Murdering a murder is not justice. It is hateful revenge.

  • Death is an Escape

    If someone commits a crime, why should they be allowed to have the easy way out? Yes, maybe what a person did was terrible but they deserve to rot in jail and think about it for the rest of their lives. That is so much more torture than just giving them a place to lie for the rest of time.

  • Death penalty opinion.

    I think that the death penalty should not be legal because that's obviously why we have jails and prisons. We don't need a whole lot of punishments, I mean, that is just retarded if we already have punishments and want more. It's like asking for more food when you already have.

  • No no no

    It harshly kills a lot of people and it does not deter crime it is againt the bibles wishes and it is a stupid escape from torture jhvyjltgbyutyuvryur vkutfgyugtl v uicyufyff jnjhjhgv gbkjhgykjgul guygfyufyuf kujgbg hgkugjfm vhfdg fjtfjgff fdjdndnd fdjdnbdhndnb difbed fjd fjd djf fjd fdjsd fdkj fdjs fdks dfk

  • No, it shouldn't be legal

    The reason why is because we are all humans and we all make mistakes, yeah i'm against people killing humans because God brought us into this world and he should be the one deciding when we die. But we shouldn't put others on death row because they are human and they can regret what they did and ask for forgiveness , the only person who can judge him is God and he should worry about what he thinks and then the family he/she hurt.

  • Evil for evil

    The Bible says, "Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you have been called, that you may obtain a blessing."
    The death penalty repays murder for murder, and therefore evil for evil. This is against what the Bible says to do.

  • No it should not be legal.

    Everybody deserves life and a second chance. We should have mercy on each other, not put each other to death. Many killers have a mental problem/disorder, and they can't control themselves. They should have life in prison, but the death penalty is too far. Upon first glance, people who have killed others are nothing but disgusting pigs. But if you take the time to look at their past, which is often extremely traumatic and painful, you might be able to understand them a little better. The worst thing in the world is to murder someone or take someone's life from them--which is why these murderers deserve life in prison. But we shouldn't take their life from them.
