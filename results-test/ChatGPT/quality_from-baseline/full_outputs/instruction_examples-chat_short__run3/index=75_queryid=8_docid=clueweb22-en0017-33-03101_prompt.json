Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

    Abortion has become a popular topic over the years. An abortion is the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy (Daum, 2012). Some people are Pro-abortionist, meaning that they believe it should be legal. Others are Anti-abortionist; they believe it should be illegal. The ongoing debate of whether abortion should remain legal or illegal aroused in the 1970‚Äôs during the Roe vs. Wade case. In 1969, Norma L. Mc Corvey known as Jane Roe discovered she was pregnant with her third child. Abortion was only legal in cases of rape or incest in Texas at the time. For this reason, Roe falsely stated that she was raped in order to obtain a legal abortion. However, this scheme failed due to the lack of evidence and police reports. Jane Roe then filed suit in a U.S District Court in Texas, alleging that the abortion law in Texas violated her constitutional rights and the rights of other women.

    The defendant in the case was Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade. The Supreme Court sided with Roe and in 1973 ‚Äúthe US Supreme Courts declared the procedure of abortion a fundamental right‚Äù (Lewis, 2012), legalizing abortion throughout the US. Jane Roe was able to provide the US Supreme Court with enough reasoning on why abortion should be legal, but does that necessarily means her claim is right? Is abortion murder? Many Pro-abortionist think that abortion is not murder, but in fact ‚ÄúDr. Micheline M. Mathews-Roth, Harvard Medical School, referenced medical textbooks that claimed that human life begins at conception‚Äù (Rose, 2009). Therefore, the fetus or embryo is actually a human. When a woman gets an abortion, it stops the life and growth of a human being, killing them.
