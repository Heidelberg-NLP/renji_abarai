Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

  • Why are Ministries and Churches Tax-Exempt Institutions?

    In the United States, there are over 300,000 religious congregations that ascribe to Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhism, and other faiths, according to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research center. All of the 300,000 places of worship fall under the tax-exempt code for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), referred to as 501(c)(3). This code also applies to nonprofit organizations with the primary purpose of education, hospitalization, or charity.

    With places of worship, the treatment is different under the tax law. Since the First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion in the United States, the IRS treats churches as tax-exempt institutions. While the driving purposes of a ministry and church may be similar or even the same, there are important differences in the way they are treated under tax laws.

    How are Ministries and Churches Treated Differently?

    A ministry needs to prove that it fulfills a tax-exempt purpose under the IRS code 501(c)(3). The difference in the way a church and a ministry are treated under tax law starts from the very beginning of either group’s organization. A church never needs to file for Recognition of Exemption from the IRS, while a ministry needs to file for tax-exempt status within 27 months of incorporating.

    A church is defined as a building for Christian worship, and a ministry is defined as an activity carried out by Christians to spread their faith. However, the IRS has a list of criteria for determining if an organization is a church, and by its nature, a ministry might not fit the definition. The IRS determines an organization as a churchwhen it performs the following:

    • Has a distinct legal existence
    • Has a recognized creed and form of worship
    • Has a definite and distinct clergy hierarchy or ecclesiastical government
    • Has a formal code of doctrine and discipline
    • Has a distinct religious history
    • Has a membership not associated with any other church or denomination
    • Has an organization of ordained ministers
    • Has ordained ministers that are selected after completing prescribed courses of study
    • Has its own literature
    • Has an established place of worship
    • Conducts regular congregations
    • Conducts regular religious services
    • Conducts Sunday school for the religious instruction of the young
    • Provides schools for the preparation of its members

    One might think that the tax-exempt status is more quickly achieved by an organization that already has a building; however, it is more complex than that. Churches, as defined above by the IRS, have a set time and place for meetings and have a regular membership or congregation. A ministry might not have regular meetings, a regular group of members, or a set meeting place. If an organization is a ministry, it does not automatically mean it could qualify as a church. Ministries are often directed outside church walls and include Bible studies, conferences, retreats, community outreach efforts, and mentoring. They may not meet at set times or places.

    While both churches and ministries qualify for tax-exempt status under the 501(c)(3) code, there are important differences between ministries and churches under tax law. One could argue that the overarching purpose for a ministry, like a church, falls into the category of 501(c)(3) automatically. Many ministries are charities, and many churches actually refer to their charitable efforts with parishioners and with the world outside of the congregation as ministries. For a ministry, this purpose needs to be demonstrated, and there are forms to qualify for the tax-exempt status.

    What Would Keep a Ministry from Being Considered Tax-Exempt?

    The IRS will not consider a ministry as a 501(c)(3) entity if it is an action organization.An action organization essentially means the ministry cannot take part in political campaigns for or against candidates or attempt to influence legislation as a driving force behind the organization. If any of the ministry’s earnings go to one individual or shareholder, this will also negate the 501(c)(3) standing.

    The paperwork that a ministry needs to file with the IRS to achieve tax-exempt status includes Form 1023 or Form 1023 EZ. This process can take up to six months. After the ministry is recognized as a tax-exempt entity, the organization needs to file Form 990 each year with the IRS, which is a form that churches are not required to file. There are several benefits for a religious organization to file as a church rather than a ministry.

    Why is a Church Law Attorney Needed?

    Most often, people who are running a church or are employed by one are thinking more about the organization’s cause than how much money is being made. A church or ministry leader can easily make the mistake of not knowing the laws that can impact the organization. This is preventable by hiring a church law attorney who can help strengthen the business side of the congregation. Knowing how to organize a business is crucial for a nonprofit too, even if the cause is religion-based.

    A church law attorney, specifically one with corporate experience, can help with all the big decisions of any religious organization, including:

    • Drafting bylaws
    • Filing articles of incorporation
    • Protecting assets
    • Selecting board members
    • Complying with discrimination and employment laws
    • Understanding tax law and exemptions
    • Dealing with zoning restrictions

    Having a church law attorney to navigate these decisions and weigh their impact is critical to the successful future of the organization. Churches and ministries can also make legal mistakes without realizing it, such as remaining unincorporated or not understanding their constitutional protections. This can lead to liability issues that stem into an organization’s finances. A church law attorney can help these organizations remain compliant and protect their rights.
