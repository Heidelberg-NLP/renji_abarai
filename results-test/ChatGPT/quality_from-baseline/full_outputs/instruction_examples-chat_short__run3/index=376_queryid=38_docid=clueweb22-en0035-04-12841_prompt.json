Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.

Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Older Adults

Are you 55+? Considering your medication options? Looking for options to opioids? Medical Cannabis for older Canadians offers safe new options to older pharmaceuticals with known side effects. Edible oils, gel capsules and oral sprays all make dosage simple and safe.

Older Canadian citizens grew up during a time when cannabis was illegal in Canada and the United States. Accordingly, the golden generation may perhaps be the most misinformed about cannabis, yet, ironically, might also be the age demographic that benefits the most from this natural plant. Below are 10 things Older Canadian citizens should know about medical cannabis. Things have changed and new information and research can make your life easier and reduce pain and sleep issues.

Although medical marijuana for PTSD has not always been accessible, veterans have been using medical marijuana to self-medicate for years. Did you know that Veteran’s Affairs allows for partial coverage of your MMS membership and of your medication once you are approved?

At MMS Canada, we will be happy to help you choose the right strain of marijuana to assist with your PTSD. Once approved our Licensed Commercial Producers will bill Veterans Affairs directly for the cost of your medicine.
