        "content": "This text presents arguments for and against making Election Day a national holiday in the USA. The arguments in favor suggest that making it a national holiday will increase voter turnout, turn the act of voting into a celebration of democracy and align the USA with other countries. On the other hand, the arguments against it suggest that it will disadvantage low-income and blue-collar workers, that changing state laws and private companies' policies would be more effective and that other solutions - such as automatic voter registration, early voting, among others - would increase voter participation more reliably. \n\nPossible discussion questions:\n- What is your opinion regarding making Election Day a national holiday? \n- Do you believe that making Election Day a national holiday would positively impact voter turnout? Why or why not? \n- Do you agree with the argument that a national holiday for Election Day would disadvantage low-income and blue-collar workers? Why or why not? \n- What are the most effective ways to increase voter participation?"
