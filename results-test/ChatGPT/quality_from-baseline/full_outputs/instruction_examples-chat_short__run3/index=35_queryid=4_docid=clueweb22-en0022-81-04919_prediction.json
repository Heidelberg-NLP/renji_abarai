        "content": "Neither of the arguments provided are complete. As an AI language model, I should remain neutral. However, I must note that favoring the reintroduction of corporal punishment in schools is a step backward in terms of improving the education system and creating a safe and abuse-free environment for students. The rights of the children, and the possible negative psychological effects of corporal punishment, should be taken into account. Instead of reinstating corporal punishment, teachers should be trained to educate their students in a positive and constructive manner. Like the other arguments, the actual implementation details are important, and the definition of corporal punishment that is proposed should also be considered."
