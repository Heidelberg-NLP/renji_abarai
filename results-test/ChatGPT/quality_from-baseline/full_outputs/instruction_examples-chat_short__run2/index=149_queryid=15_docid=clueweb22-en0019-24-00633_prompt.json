Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Animals Be Used For Medical Science Research?

Decent Essays
Is the use of animals in medical science research justified? Should this be permitted? Why is it allowed that animals have to suffer so a human can use Windex or wear makeup? An estimated 26 million animals are used every year in the United States for scientific and commercial testing. Animal research testing is unnecessary to advance medical research any further. At one time when technology was not caught up with the rest of the world, it may have been useful because without animal testing, products would be based on theory. However, technology has come a long way in the last 50 years. Nonetheless, there seem to be many pros and cons to this topic as experts continue to argue on the way research should be done. Several medical research institutions make use of animals as test subjects. They are subject to experimentation and altered into conditions useful for acquiring knowledge about diseases we humans continue to fight or testing for potential treatments, solutions or cures. Rats and mice share several genetic and physiological traits with humans, which is why they are the most abused test subjects. Since they share so many of our human qualities they increasingly help further medical science research. Yes, there has been some animal testing contributed to life saving cures, but does that make it right? Proponents of animal testing also believe the animal benefits from the testing, which is the most outrageous thing I 've ever heard. If the vaccines for distemper,
