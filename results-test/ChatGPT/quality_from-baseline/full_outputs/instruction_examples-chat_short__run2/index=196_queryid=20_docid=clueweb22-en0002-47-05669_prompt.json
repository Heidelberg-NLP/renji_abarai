Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is drinking milk good for your heart?

Is drinking whole milk ok for heart health or should you switch to skimmed milk or soy or almond milk?

There is this eternal debate over milk: is it beneficial for your heart or not. Most nutritionists and experts believe that since whole milk is rich in saturated fat and cholesterol it can increase the risk of heart diseases and up one's cardiovascular risk. But we cannot ignore the fact that consumption of milk is also necessary. It is a rich source of calcium and helps to improve bone health and heart health too. This is the reason some doctors and nutritionists suggest making a switch to low-fat milk to reap the benefits of milk.

Whole milk vs skimmed milk

However, recently some studies claimed that probably milk (whole or skim) might not be all that bad for your heart. In 2014 a study published in Current Nutrition Reports tried to explore the effects of milk on cardiovascular health. Eighteen observational studies were reviewed, the results of which indicated that total dairy intake does not contribute to cardiovascular disease incidence or death. Based on available data, it appeared that milk, cheese, and yogurt are not directly associated with cardiovascular disease risk. A series of studies examined the relationships between dairy consumption, such as milk (whole, semi-skimmed, fat-free), cheese, butter, cream, yogurt, and ice cream, and the relative risks for CVD, including CHD and stroke. One such meta-analysis which included nine prospective studies indicated that the highest versus lowest amounts of total dairy consumption reduced the relative risk of CHD by 8 percent another showed that milk consumption reduced the risk of stroke by 21 percent. The study also observed that in 600,000 multi-ethnic people there was an inverse association between milk intake and CVD risk. There was a six percent decreased risk associated with each people who had 200 ml/day of milk consumed. According to this study, neither milk (full-fat or low-fat) nor butter was associated with the incidence of CVD in this study.

Animal milk vs plant-based milk

Many people give up drinking milk in a bid to protect their heart or some make a shift from drinking cow s milk to plant-based milk like soy milk, almond milk etc. A study published in 2016 in the journal Food and Research explored the benefits of switching from animal-based milk to plant-based ones. This study had the evidence that intake of milk and dairy products were associated with reduced risk of childhood obesity. In adults, intake of dairy products was shown to improve body composition and facilitate weight loss. In addition, intake of milk and dairy products was associated with a neutral or reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly stroke. Among cancers, milk and dairy intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, and not associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or lung cancer, while the evidence for prostate cancer risk was inconsistent [2].

These two studies showed that there was very less evidence to prove that drinking milk could have been harmful to heart health. If you are concerned about your heart health and want to make a healthy change probably switching to low-fat milk is a good idea. But make sure you are your calcium requirements from other foods and munching on nuts and flaxseeds to reap the benefits of good fats. If you have a heart problem, remember cutting down on whole milk (because of its saturated fat) alone won t help. Instead, cut down on other vices like smoking, drinking, sedentary lifestyle, etc and make healthy diet choices. As far as milk is concerned drinking 200 ml of milk every day will not be too much harm.
