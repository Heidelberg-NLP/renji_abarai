Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should the U.S. kill the penny?

Canada kills its penny

Canada is dropping the use of its penny today. And some economists believe the United States should be following its neighbor's example.

The U.S. Mint spent 2 cents to produce and ship each of the 5.8 billion pennies sent to banks last year. But in addition to being a money loser for the Treasury, there are arguments that the penny has simply outlived its usefulness.

Greg Mankiw, Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush, said American consumers have shown they don't value the penny, even if most polls show opposition to getting rid of the coin.

"When people start leaving a monetary unit at the cash register for the next customer, the unit is too small to be useful," he said.

Businesses say rounding to the nearest nickel would save time for both their cashiers and their customers. But they're reluctant to push for a change that could spark a backlash. That's exactly what happened last summer when Mexican food chain Chipotle (CMG) started rounding at some of its high volume stores.

"Yes it would speed up transactions, and yes that is good," said Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores. "But if it's a convenience that the customer doesn't want, we're not going to question the consumers' decision."

Advocates for keeping the penny include Americans for Common Cents, a trade group supported by Jarden (JAH), which has a subsidiary which makes the zinc and copper blanks turned into pennies by the Mint. The group commissioned a poll last year showing that two-thirds of Americans want to keep the penny. It often cites a study by Penn State economics professor Raymond Lombra that estimates that consumers would end up paying a "rounding tax" of $2 billion to $4 billion over the course of two years if the penny is eliminated.

But Robert Whaples, an economics professor at Wake Forest, has done his own study looking at thousands of convenience store purchases. That study shows consumers as a group would break even if stores rounded to the nearest nickel. He said so many pennies fall out of circulation each year because consumers don't see them as valuable, raising both the costs to the Mint as well as the economy as a whole.

"The main argument against the penny is that it wastes our time," he said. "We're clearly losing money on the penny."

Besides Canada's example, other countries have dropped their lowest denomination coins without problem.

But Whaples conceded that killing the penny is unlikely since the public isn't eager to give up the coin.

"The vast majority want to keep a penny, regardless of all the good arguments against it," he said. "It's a sentimental attachment."
