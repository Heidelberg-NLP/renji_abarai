Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Teens Be Allowed to Vote?

 

 

By Anna Starecheski and Laura Anastasia

One California city may let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local elections.

Teens can do a lot to change the world. They can start food drives. They can pick up litter. They can donate money to causes they believe in.

There is one thing younger teens can’t do to change the world. They can’t vote. People must be at least 18 years old to vote in most elections in the United States.

But that might change soon in San Francisco, California. In November, city residents will vote on whether to let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local elections.

A handful of smaller cities already let young teens vote in local elections. But San Francisco would be the first big U.S. city to do it.

Should 16- and 17-year-olds be allowed to vote? Here are both sides.

Yes!

Government decisions affect teens’ lives. So more teens deserve a voice in how their city is run, some people say. In addition, voting is a habit, others argue. People who start voting at 16 might be more likely to vote as adults.

No!

Voting is an important responsibility. But younger teens might not take it seriously, some people say. Others argue that many teens do not know enough about the government. They may not understand what they are voting on until they get older.


What do you think? Should 16- and 17-year-olds be allowed to vote? Why or why not?

Voting Through the Years

Will young teens get the right to vote? They might! The rules about who can vote have changed over time. Here is how. 

1788-1789
The first election for president takes place. In most states, only white men who own land or a business can vote.

1870
The 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is approved. It gives all men the right to vote, regardless of their skin color. But some states make new rules to stop Black men from voting.

1920
The 19th Amendment is approved. It gives women the right to vote. But some state rules still prevent Black women from voting.

1924
A new law declares that Native Americans are U.S. citizens. That means they can vote. Some states block Native Americans from voting anyway.

1965
The Voting Rights Act is passed. The law says states can not prevent or make it difficult for Black people, Native Americans, and other groups to vote.

1971
The voting age is lowered from 21 to 18. Young Americans had argued that if they were old enough to fight in the Vietnam War (1962-1975), they were old enough to vote. 

1975
A new Voting Rights Act is passed. It helps people who don’t speak English. It says cities must have ballots in other languages.

1990
The Americans with Disabilities Act is passed. It says states must make sure people with disabilities are able to vote.
