Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Economics Essays: Why University Education should be Free.

Tuesday, October 2, 2007

Why University Education should be Free.

With the expansion in university numbers, there has been a divisive debate about how much students (and their families) should actually pay.

There are several arguments to suggest the government should provide university education free at the point of use, and make it available to everyone.

1. Greater Equality.

Free education enables everyone to have the opportunity of studying. It also avoids the complexity of means testing systems

2. University Education is a Merit Good.

People often underestimate the benefits of studying at university. This is exacerbated by the fact that the benefits of studying are a long time in the future. If people have to pay it will encourage people to leave education at 18 or 16.

3. Positive Externality of University Education.

University education gives benefits to the rest of society. For example, a qualified doctor helps treat other people. People with degrees can become teachers and impart knowledge. Therefore, the social benefit of universities are higher than private benefit. Therefore, in a free market university education will be underconsumed, because the free market ignores these positive externalities. This justifies the government providing it free at the point of use.

4. Difficulty of Finance

In the US, students often leave university with very significant debts. This creates financial stress from a very young age. In the UK, student debt is becoming an increasing problem. It forces many students to take part time jobs whilst studying. Student loans can be a disincentive to get a better paid job, because low paid jobs do not need to pay them back
