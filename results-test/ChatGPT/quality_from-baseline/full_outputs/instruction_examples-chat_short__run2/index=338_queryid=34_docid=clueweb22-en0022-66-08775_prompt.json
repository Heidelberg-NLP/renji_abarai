Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

The Best Social Networking Sites for Students

best social networking sites for students

Her foray into blogging was not planned; it was accidental. Started as a writer at the age of 15, Shreya has expertise in writing engaging content for the readers and has a deep interest in unique applications of technology in various domains.

April 6, 2021

Nowadays, everybody is engulfed in social media – you, me, the young, the old. One critical approach to render learning is to reach students where they are, which includes locating social networking outlets that can be used in the classroom. While social media inherently combines with subjects such as language arts and social studies, tech-savvy teachers should realise that teamwork can function in any classroom. If you are thinking that social networking sites for students are like the regular Facebook, Instagram let me burst the bubble because the best social networking sites for students are certainly not limited to just Facebook or Twitter. 

The Best Social Networking Sites for Students

Twiducate

Defined as a “walled garden,” this platform is advertised as a protected place for teachers and students to collaborate. It is simple to use and helps teachers to build an online class environment using a class code rather than an email address. It also provides teachers full power over who enters and what is written. It’s also absolutely secure.

TweenTribune

Want to collaborate with a platform that brings kids up to date with current events? TweenTribune brings students up to date with social affairs, such as the Easthampton teen whose tongue froze to a metal pole and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s plan to lengthen the school day and the school year. It brings students into the habit of reading the news and helps them to focus on the activities of the day. Unfortunately, it contains ads (but which website doesn’t?). It just covers the good news of the day– just don’t come expecting the latest on the Syrian crisis.

30hands Learning Network

The 30hands Learning Community is an outstanding cloud-based solution for educators who want to communicate with others, track/manage students, plan activities, and more. It is one of the best social networking sites for students.

Brainly

It is a cool social network where students can ask questions and other students from all around the world can address them.

ClassHook

A perfect resource for finding instructional videos/clips that can be “skipped” to avoid objectionable material.

Classloom

It is a friendly social network that helps students and educators to connect and access resources on every mobile device. Classloom is a top-performing and one of the best social networking sites for students.

Blackboard

It is the world’s pioneer in course management applications. The choice to use Blackboard is normally taken at the district level, while individual schools can do so on occasion. Blackboard is an extremely strong, safe, one of the best social networking sites for students, and an all-encompassing forum. Many younger teachers would be comfortable with it as a product of their teacher preparation programmes. The disadvantage is the expense. This is a really pricey network, but you get what you pay for. However, it would miss any versatility for the most technologically savvy teachers.

EDU2.0

This is about instructors who wish to incorporate course management programmes such as Blackboard without incurring extra costs. Edu2.0 begins by including a free trial of all of its premium services. After the trial period expires, certain functions are disabled, however, you can continue to use the standard platform for free. These features would be sufficient for the normal consumer, but might not be sufficient for “control users.” Edu2.0 is cloud-based which would not necessitate a large expenditure in computing space.

Wikispaces Classroom

Wikispaces Classroom demonstrates that collaboration is second nature to Wiki participants. Wiki Classrooms are private media networks that provide news feeds and networking resources. It’s secure when you pick who gets invited — teachers, parents, and administrators. Within the web, you can delegate, work on, discuss, and evaluate projects. It is also capable of handling multimedia. The best thing is that Wikispaces Classroom is completely online.

Edmodo

It is one of the best social networking sites for students. Here’s just another fantastic free classroom management device. It has news feeds, evaluation software, networking functions, and protection features.

Skype

Many too many educators underestimate Skype’s potential in the classroom. It is the one website that has the ability to practically carry the outer world into your school. You may host writers, visit science laboratories, and correspond with pen pals from all over the world.

MinecraftEdu

MinecraftEdu’s hidden weapon is the ability to leverage the influence of video games to educate students. This game helps students to collaborate together, discover, and solve challenges while learning about history, finance, technology, and math. Teachers can tailor it to their own needs. MinecraftEdu is the most popular social media for students.

Sumdog

This gaming platform is like flashcards on crack. This website is common among elementary school-aged children. The opportunity to connect contacts to their profiles is the networking element. Kids will rush home from school to play them on the internet. It has entertaining degrees and clever characters.

ISTE Community

International Society for Technology & Education is a fantastic place for educators to engage in technical challenges and develop their personal learning network.

IT Peer Network Education

A friendly online group aimed at promoting online communication and increasing teachers’ technical literacy.

Otus

Puts the whole school group (parents, staff, students) together through a shared technology forum, thus presenting school leaders with actionable feedback. Otus belongs to the list of the top social media sites for students.

Plurk

A social network (micro-blogging) close to Twitter, with a timeline view and a friendly karma-based site.

Skooville

It is a great network for kids to learn about cyber protection and is one of the best social networking sites for students.

Skype in the Classroom

One of the best ways to introduce real-time video communication to the classroom through virtual field trips, “mystery” visitors, and other means.

Teamie

It is an outstanding social learning network for smartphone applications that facilitates “flipped” learning effectively.

TED-Ed

The easiest location to find instructional videos and tutorials on the internet.

Twitter

It is by far one of the most successful and one of the best social networking sites for students. This micro-tweeting platform is popular around the world, particularly in education (search hashtags #edchat, #edtech, #flipclass, and so on). Furthermore, with the upcoming parental controls, Twitter is becoming a more realistic choice for educators on a daily basis.

WhoTeaches

It is a popular social media for students network that links teachers, caregivers, and educators. This is accomplished by teamwork, which includes the opportunity to exchange documents and form communities. In addition, this website provides high-level education for students searching for tutors online or to read.
