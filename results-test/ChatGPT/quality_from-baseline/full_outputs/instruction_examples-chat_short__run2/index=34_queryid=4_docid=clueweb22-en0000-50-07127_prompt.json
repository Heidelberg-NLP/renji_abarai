Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Debate on Corporal Punishment Should Be Banned at School: Good morning, the respected jury members, my respected teachers, my opponents, and my dear friends.
Today, I ________ feel privileged to stand in front of you and express my thoughts on a debate topic that is very close to my heart. The topic is ‘Corporal Punishment should be banned at School’ and I am going to speak in favor of the motion.

Dear friends, do you have any idea what corporal punishment is? I know many of you will come up with the answer. Yes, it is a punishment by inflicting physical pain on someone, intentionally. But you also have to keep in mind that it is not only limited to physical pain. It can leave a deep psychological impact as physical punishment also affects the mental health of a child.
If we discuss the negative effects of corporal punishment we can include many to our list. We must understand why a teacher wants corporal punishment. It depends on a lot of factors, starting from the attitude of the teacher and his/her approach towards students. When a teacher is not able to coordinate with some of the students and control them, he finds corporal punishment is the only way to handle the situation. It may also happen that teacher loses his temper in extreme situations that result in corporal punishment.
I am no one to judge my respected teachers. They always hold a special place in all students’ lives. They are our guides and mentors. But sometimes they find trouble in handling certain situations those result in corporal punishment. There may be various reasons by the school authority to justify corporal punishment. But everyone should consider the fact that it can affect the child’s emotions in a very unpredictable way which is not at all desirable.
In this debate on corporal punishment should be banned at school, it is very important to establish the idea that no one has the right to play with a child’s emotions, be it, parents or teachers. Many a time it is noticed that a student withdraws himself/herself from the activities of the surroundings due to set back from corporal punishment in school. There may be a sharp downfall in his mental development at this growing age. So to be on safer side I strongly believe that corporal punishment should be banned at school.
We should never categorize students in our way because every child is different. They have different thought processes, capabilities, and emotions. It is the responsibility of teachers to provide a nurturing environment in school and handle students’ emotions with affection and care. Some students are not as obedient as others; some are not studious as expected but teachers have to find some other way to keep them on track rather than giving corporal punishment.
It has been observed that corporal punishment stops many students to flourish in the way they do so. For example, a student may not be good at studies but find pleasure in some other activities. If he/she is forced to do something with corporal punishment, his natural talents may not find a way to flourish. The child’s mind is very sensitive and corporal punishment may result in serious consequences. He gets frightened even to see others getting punished and may not open up in the fear of rejection. Children are full of energy and often act in a way that may look unusual to the teachers. But to make them disciplined and obedient, corporal punishment should not be used.
We must look at this issue that corporal punishment should be banned at school in much deeper and think of its consequences in long term. The students facing corporal punishment in school may suddenly change to a different personality. Some even try to end life if they feel insulted in front of others. Sometimes such students get humiliated by others in the school environment and take some extreme steps. So we can easily deduce from all of these, that corporal punishment should be banned at school. There may be some immediate positive effects observed by teachers and parents, but in the long run, it hampers the growth of the child.
Dear friends, so far I have expressed my views about the effect of corporal punishment on the mental health of students. But there are other aspects as well, which are equally serious. Yes, I am pointing to the physical injury which is one of the main reasons why corporal punishment should be banned at school. We come across news that some body parts of the child get damaged due to severe physical impact. Many times a student might get hurt seriously by any chance and it causes damage to some parts of his body or organs. There are cases where such damage or injury leads to serious medical complications and even puts life at risk. There were times when corporal punishment was very common in the school environment and teachers felt it was the only way to handle a naughty or disobedient student. But now any sort of corporal punishment should be banned at school. Any action which has hardly any positive reaction can’t be encouraged at any time or any level, especially when it matters to a child’s development and future.
The school authority must ensure that corporal punishment should be banned at school because student’s physical and mental well-being is of utmost importance. It is of most priority that a student who comes to school should get adequate exposure and opportunity for development. Schools are temples of learning and students come here to build a bright future. So it is the responsibility of teachers and other staff to give them the right direction which will enable the nation to prosper.
While supporting the idea that corporal punishment should be banned at school, I also want to mention one important thing that students should not take undue advantage of the absence of corporal punishment. They have great responsibilities as a student to maintain a healthy and disciplined environment in school premises. They should always follow the rules and regulations of the institutions and show respect to teachers. They must follow the guidelines given by teachers because teachers are the mentors who can show them the right way for a better future.
I think I have made sufficiently strong ground to support the opinion that corporal punishment should be banned in schools. At the same time, I must thank my school authority and teachers for guiding me in taking the steps from human beings towards being human.
