Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should the covid 19 vaccine be mandatory for children? - Quora

Forcing all to take a vaccine to hope to prevent 1 child in a million for hospitaliztion is not logical. Medical science should search for a cure.

Obviously.

Four of our five children have had their first shot. Three yesterday, since they‚Äôre under 12. The last today only because there were no appointments.

Duh.

That decision should be solely on the parents. I wouldn't do it to my kids because covid is not dangerous to children. Atleast not enough to persuade me into giving them an experimental medical treatment

We've put together a list of 8 money apps to get you on the path towards a bright financial future.

Absolutely not!. This vaccine has not been around or tested long enough to know how it might affect the body in years to come. Just because a person gets the vaccine and walks out the clinic door with no problems, there is no way to know what it might do to someone a year from now. Or two years. Or five years. Adults have the ability to accept the risk for themselves. Children don‚Äôt. They rely on their parents to make an educated decision on their behalf. The government shouldn‚Äôt force children to be guinea pigs.

Why is this a thing? You're vaccinated against polio, measles, whooping cough, small Pox all which can cripple and kill you like covid19 but yet you're making a God damn federal case of covid19.

I don‚Äôt think it should be mandatory for children to get the vaccine. But I do think it should be mandatory for children attending public schools to get the vaccine unless they have a medical exception. If you want to risk Covid for your child, well I mean it sucks to be that kid but our country allows you to make that choice. But what you don‚Äôt get to do is send your viral vector into the public schools to potentially make other children ill. There are a ton of mandated vaccines and no one blinks an eye. But when Fox News and social media turn one vaccine into a political statement we see all

But when Fox News and social media turn one vaccine into a political statement we see all kinds of crazy behavior to virtue signal the rest of the tribe. There have always been anti-vaxxers and if we are honest most of them are pretty dense. But when you add politics to the mix it gets so much worse.

This might sound unconventional, but hands down I‚Äôd go with blue-chip art. A Basquait painting soared 2,209,900% when it was bought for $5,000 and sold for $110,500,000. And if you think that is crazy, a Leonardo Da Vinci painting skyrocketed 5,328,894%. Although not guaranteed, if you can f

It shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory for anyone regardless of age. Only an idiot would get the shot because someone else told them to. Free choice.

Seeing that they can spread it to their families friends and neighbours, it is a reasonable idea. Whether it will happen is another matter.

it should be mandatory for EVERYONE, other than those with LEGITIMATE MEDICAL reasons for not taking it. PERIOD.

NO !!!

Any health choice or anything else for that matter having to do with the child should be up to the parents üôÑüôÑüò†

And as for polio, measles, vaccine, etc. ‚Ä¶..

Those things were real !! Not some Damned govment scam with a man spending billions trying to reduce the world population for the ‚Äúantichrist‚Äù (known as the 'new wicked order') ‚Äô!!!

No, it shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory at all but especially not for children. The rate of children contracting covid is near zero as it is. Vaccination does nothing to stop the spread of covid, and covid is not inherently a children's disease like the measles, small pox, polio, ect.

The decision to take any medication/drug should always something that‚Äôs discussed be between a doctor and the patient.

As a matter of personal opinion, no, not unless and until CDC and other responsible healthcare advocacies like the AMA agree that sufficient evidence exists to put the covid-19 vaccine(s) risk-benefit ratio in the same class as other vaccines that are mandated for schoolchildren.

From what I've heard so far, it seems as though the risk to children (and to adults from children) in them being unvaccinated is low, and the risks in actually taking the vaccine are higher than for adults. That would tend to suggest that mandating vaccination in that age group is probably not justified.

However, the risk from COVID-19 is probably still greater than the risk from vaccination, so a case could be made even at this level. It's uncomfortable to mandate an action thay carries risk if the risk it avoids is not far greater, but logically it makes good sense.

There is also a csse for ma

There is also a csse for mandating COVID-19 vaccination in particular, as soon as it can be shown to be safe, because we really want to bring down the spread to reduce the risk of developing further strains.

It's a complex epidemiological question that can't be answered in terms of general principles but has to be assessed in the context of specific numerical data.

If a new strain emerges that is more dangerous to children, that can radically and suddenly change the whole equation, too.

Q: Should the covid 19 vaccine be mandatory for children?

NO! ABSOLUTELY NO! In the first place they should not, and legally cannot be mandatory for anyone but other than that children are pretty much immune to this con job. Are you some kind of a Nazi? Nothing in this world should be mandatory for children or anyone else.

After several million children have received the vaccine and over several years show receiving the vaccine to be safer than not receiving it, then yes, it should be made mandatory. Until then, no. The data is just not there yet.

I was asked to answer this question.

Should the covid 19 vaccine be mandatory for children?

Answer.

Yes.

The sheeple that blindly obey their masters will get the vaxx and vaxx their kids. When the vaxxed go into, ‚Äòthe long night‚Äô, like the ferrets and spider-monkeys did in the animal studies, there will be more resources for the intelligent/educated people.

One may call it evolution or destiny. The population will be reduced and utopia is coming. After‚Ä¶.

Armageddon 2040

Note: humans have evolved and survived for millions, or 5782 years without vaccines. Do vaccines interfere with evolution?

Q: Should the covid 19 vaccine be mandatory for children?

A: Yes, so they don‚Äô spread mutated viruses to the rest of us.

Vaccines are required to enter public school, and some doctors‚Äô offices will not see pediatric patients whose parents refuse vaccinations. So far, mandates have not been required for children. You would think parents would want to protect their children when they see numbers rise of unvaccinated children in ICU‚Äôs.

if your school board decides to mandate certain vaccinations i believe they are within their rights. in saner times there were exemptions to the mandates like religious conviction or a doctor‚Äôs note explaining why a particular child should be exempt. if parents take their children out of government schools there is no compelling reason for a vaccine mandate.

Schools already require a number of vaccines. This is one additional to protect kids and their younger siblings who can't be vaccinated yet. And their older relatives too.

Of course not. Why should a nanotechnology product that has not been fully tested, and may not have long term efficacy, be mandatory for children?

All the parents I know are planning to.

It would be child abuse not to.

There‚Äôs no way to know the long term impact of these new vaccines on the vaccinated. Giving the vaccination to a 55-year old - who‚Äôs far more vulnerable to Covid than a 6-year old - is a lt different than giving it to a child.

It‚Äôs bad enough it‚Äôs happening to adults but to experiment on babies is SICK AND WRONG ! This is one of the easier pictures to look at ü§¨ the rash , the myocarditis, the FND and to force it on kids is disgusting.

Pfizer is now approved for children ages 5 to 11. Pfizer is in the process of seeking approval from the CDC for emergency use of its vaccine in children under 5.

Approved so far:

Vaccines Authorized For

Children 4 years and under:

  ‚Ä¢ None

Children 5‚Äì11 years old:

  ‚Ä¢ Pfizer-BioNTech

Teens 12‚Äì17 years old:
