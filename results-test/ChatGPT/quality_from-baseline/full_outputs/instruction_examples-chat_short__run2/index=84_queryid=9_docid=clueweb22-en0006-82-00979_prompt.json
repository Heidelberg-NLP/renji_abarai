Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should students wear school uniforms? | Debate.org
  • Yes, they do wear uniforms.

    Because, what if they went on a trip and they did not wear uniforms? What if they went on a trip and the building caught on fire and there were a lot of people with no uniforms? No one knows, no one remembers, so I think uniforms are a good thing.

  • Think about it.

    I have been reading some of these opinions and I must say that it's quite interesting. Now, school uniforms should be required. I also want to say that I come from a small Christian private school, and that we have to wear uniforms. Honestly, there is nothing wrong with uniforms. You have a dress code for a reason. That dress code is there to protect you. If you wouldn't have a dress code, who knows how immodest some people would dress. People get frustrated even disturbed when a guy takes advantage of a girl, right? But...Think about it...How was she dressed? Provocative clothing shows that someone wants attention, and they want it fast. I'm a senior in high school and I've been wearing the same school uniforms all my life. I've grown accustom to them. So they don't bother me. Anyways, I was also reading the "No" side, and I saw a lot of "...They take the creativity away from students..." or "...They're stupid, and uncomfortable..." Well, if your clothing were comfortable, then you'd be too comfortable in classes and possibly fall asleep. Also, the whole "...They take the creativity away from students..." Well, BULL CRAP...Creativity is from your mind, your imagination, it's not based on what you wear! Some people have a bigger imagination than others. Like I said, I go to a small Christian private school, and we all wear uniforms, but we're also creative and a lot of us have some crazy imaginations. Also, not all schools have those stereotypical uniforms like in the movies, you know, the pleated plaid skirts, stockings or tights, button downs and ties etc. etc., my school, we have to wear only red, white, or navy polo shirts, and only navy or khaki skirts. The skirts have to come to at least the middle of the knee and the lowness of the polo have to be no less than right below the collarbone. This really is not bad. I also read, that school uniforms take away the individual's unique personality. Well, not necessarily. Everyone has their own way of expressing themselves, and it's not all through what you wear, it's through your words, your actions, your likes/dislikes...You don't have to express yourself through your clothing. I don't and I am BIG on everyone being themselves. I add my own flare to my uniform by wearing a colorful, long sleeve shirt, or wearing my bright, yellow rain boots...Everyone has their own flare, whether they add something to their uniform or not...I also play volleyball at my school...We don't wear spandex, or super tight shirts...We wear skorts...For those that don't know what that is, it's like a skirt with shorts attached underneath, and they come to our knees, and our jerseys are loose-fitting and breathable and able to move in very easily. So I guess you can say that, I'm pro-school uniforms.

  • I Think Yes To The Issue Because ...

    In This Generation Kids Can Be So Mean / Rude / Disrespectful / Etc. Kid's Bully Others Because Of What They Wear Or How They Present Themselves . Some People Of Today Have No Clue That Some People Don't Have Money Like The Rest . Some Struggle Just To Feed There Familys , So The Last Thing They Actually Think About Is Clothing On There Backs ... I Am 14 & A Freshman @ Briggs High School . I Am All For Uniforms .

  • Bullying can stop.

    If students wear uniforms they can't get bullied for what they wear because everyone is wearing the same thing. People get bullied for wearing certain clothes that are different from others. So, if everyone wears uniforms no one can get bullied for wearing different clothing. Bulling can stop if we just wear the same clothing.

  • I think students should wear school uniforms

    There are more pros than cons with school uniforms in high schools. There is more modesty. No offensive logos, offensive texts, etc. I'm in high school and some of the clothes the girls wear are very inappropriate and immodest. So yes, schools uniforms should at least be considered in high school.

  • Yes we need to have uniforms for school!!

    I say that you would want to have uniforms because it will take affect on the bulling and that it will help with students in school. I am a student in school today, and I say that we all need to have uniforms to stop the bulling in our school system :)

  • Focus on work and bullying can stop

    When kids wear what ever they want kids are focusing on the "latest" style, but when kids wear uniforms they will focus on school work.Bullying is also a problem, kids get bullied from what they wear,but when they wear uniforms the bully will notice that they are wearing the exact same thing

  • Students are being discriminated for what they wear!

    Students who wear a school uniform are at less risk of being bullied. Students are trying to be more and more like celebrities today, students who can not afford these "high end" brands and being bullied and judged, having a school uniform will reduce this risk. . . . .

  • School uniforms must be a must

    Sometimes, some children feel inferior to children who wear designer brands. For this sense of inferiority and superiority to be broken, we can use school uniforms which will give all the children a sense of equality. Also, when a child wears colour clothes on his or her birthday, it makes them feel special. If all the kids where colour clothes, then the birthday child won't feel that special. It'll be like he/she is just another one in the group

  • Lack of Originality and Expression

    If students wear school uniforms, they will have lack of imagination or won't be able to show their expressions or originality. With school uniforms, they could also mistake one another for someone who they're not. Schools should definitely not add school uniforms to to their school. The kids are there to learn, not to dress up.

  • THEY'RE DUMB and stupid

    You have to worry about uniform violations and worry about what your classmates think. When we wear uniforms we surrender our free rights and we let the teachers unions [who I think own the country] boss us kids around . If we don't do something [like protest] then we will continually be bossed around by the teachers [whose jobs aren't to yell at us but to teach us]. We must stand up for ourselves! We must steal the mantle of power from the teachers unions. During the thing when teachers protested about how much money they get the teachers unions forced the teachers to protest or be fined a couple thousand dollars! I'm just expressing my opinion, don't yell at me!

  • Don't wear uniform clothes.

    Don't take away more creativity. No, I do not believe students should wear uniforms to school. School uniforms reinforce the idea that students are numbers and not individuals. In a school system that is continually taking art and creativity out of the hands of students, I feel this is a step in the wrong direction.

  • It is boring!

    I really don't think students need to wear uniform. School uniforms are not comfortable while P.T. ,dance ,yoga etc . School uniforms are very irritating sometimes . Sometimes school uniforms can be good but ,mostly I don't like them. The fabric of most of the uniforms are very bad making them very uncomfortable .

  • Bullying won't stop.

    People say that it will help prevent bullying, but the truth is that nothing can help it. It won't make a difference if we just make them all wear the same clothes. That doesn't make the bullies think OK I am going to stop. There are more things about the kid maybe, how they talk or act, or their face or hair looks, not just the clothes they wear.

  • Is our skin color all the same?

    I do not believe schools should have school uniforms. I believe it blocks the students ablity to be different and unique. A student should be able to show how he is different and express them selfs. School is one of the biggest social area in a childs lifes. They need to know how to express themselfs.

  • Uniforms are bad.

    I think that uniforms are so bad because you can't force somebody to use a uniform. But, in my point of view I think that you can save money with the uniforms, because you only buy uniforms, in the mornings. That's my opinions about uniforms in school in the UK and USA.

  • Don't take away more creativity

    No, I do not believe students should wear uniforms to school. School uniforms reinforce the idea that students are numbers and not individuals. In a school system that is continually taking art and creativity out of the hands of students, I feel that this is a step in the wrong direction.

  • NO UNIFORMS PlZ

    You know we have a right to choose
    So we have to learn how to choose and use it! Like choosing what to wear
    We have free dom
    I'm not saying its terrible or anything, just saying students have freedom.
    I'm a student myself and I don't really like uniforms thx

  • they can wear any type of clothes
