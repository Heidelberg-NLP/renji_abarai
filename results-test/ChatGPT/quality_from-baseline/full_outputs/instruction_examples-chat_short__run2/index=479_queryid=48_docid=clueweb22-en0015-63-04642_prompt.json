Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Argumentative Essay: Should the Voting Age Be Lowered to Thirteen?

This essay argues out whether the voting age should be lowered to thirteen. The age thirteen was picked because it is a time when a child should start thinking more about becoming an adult, and it is a time in a person’s life when the Jewish faith says a child becomes an adult.ArgumentPeople that young are too easy to manipulateOn the whole, people are easy to manipulate, especially when it comes to fear, as that is how George Bush Jr was able to run for two terms as oppose to just cheating his way in one.

People that are younger are even easier to manipulate and that will only increase the amount of fear based media and pressure when it comes to voters.Counter argumentPeople should be protected from manipulationIt is unfair to say that younger people are easier to manipulate when older people and mentally ill people are also easy to manipulate. The real answer is to make it impossible to manipulate the voters in any way, as that would means older and younger people may vote more fairly. Counter-counter argumentWe do not live in a society where such protection is possibleThere is no place in the world that has come up with a way of stopping one group or one person from manipulating another person or group of people. Whilst manipulation is possible with older people, it is still more likely to happen with younger people, which is why they should wait until they are old enough so they may vote.ArgumentRepresentation is the only way to have a voice heardThis is from the historical evidence showing that a group of people are often treat poorly until they are represented in the government in some form.

At the moment, there are no 13yr old ministers or senators, but if a younger person were able to vote then that person may vote for people with younger persons needs in mind.Counter argumentYounger people do not need representation as that is their parents’ jobIt is the job of the parents to fight for the rights and the wellbeing of their children. This is currently the case, as political candidates will often pander to the “breeders” and offer policies and attitudes that address the needs of both parents and their offspring. There is also the fact that the needs of younger people would be represented twice. The parents would still be looking out for the needs of their children, and the teens would also be looking out for their own needs. This would double the size of a certain group in unfair proportions to other groups.

ConclusionThere were some points that were missed from this essay as they are too difficult to conclude upon, such as if parents would influence the votes of their children, and people having children so that they have a bigger team of voters, etc. The arguments issued within this essay seem to point to the fact that voting ages should not be lowered.
