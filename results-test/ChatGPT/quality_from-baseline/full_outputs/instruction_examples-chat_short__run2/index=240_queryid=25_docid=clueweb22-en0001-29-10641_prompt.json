Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should All Education be Free Free Essay Example

Should All Education be Free

All education should be free to all people and paid for by the government. This statement has caused great controversy over the past decades.

  ‚Ä¢ On the one hand, it should be free since there are poor who are smart, intelligent and capable, yet the state provides no education for them. How would you feel knowing that your life is never going to get better because you don‚Äôt have the opportunity?
  ‚Ä¢ Another argument is economic development. Finishing school and pursuing a career will allow you to get a higher standard of living hence economic development.

  ‚Ä¢ The last argument for free education is economic growth. If everyone gets a well paid job, they will contribute to society by becoming taxpayers. The state will be capable of improving the country.
  ‚Ä¢ On the other hand, it shouldn‚Äôt be free as tax would need to increase to provide free education and not many are pleased with this idea. However, if tax doesn‚Äôt increase, we will get a mediocre education.

    This is seen in Peru where there aren‚Äôt even enough schools and universities.

  ‚Ä¢ In addition, if everyone gets educated, no one would want to take the low paid jobs. An example is Spain. An ex-CEO prefers not to work rather than to work as a taxi driver.

In conclusion I do think that education should be free since it is our right to get the opportunity to improve our lives. Yes, it can be very expensive for the state at first, but the advantages are invaluable to our society.
