Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Title: Alternative energy: Can renewable energy sources replace fossil fuels

Abstract

Fossil fuels have been the prime mover of industrial life for some 200 years. The burning of coal and oil have saved inestimable amounts of time and labor while substantially raising living standards around the world. But many scientists now say the use of fossil fuels, which account for 85% of US energy use, contributes to global warming and could ultimately threaten the planet's future. That concern, coupled with America's growing dependence on insecure fuel sources, has sparked new interest in alternatives. Unlike in the 1970s, however, this time renewable energy may be more than just a fad. Technological advancements have made the economics of wind and solar power much more competitive. Moreover, public utilities are beginning to consider the environmental costs of cheap fossil fuels. This article discusses the background, energy strategies, wind power, solar power, nuclear power, biomass energy, alternative-fuel automobiles, and economic analysis of using renewable energy sources.
