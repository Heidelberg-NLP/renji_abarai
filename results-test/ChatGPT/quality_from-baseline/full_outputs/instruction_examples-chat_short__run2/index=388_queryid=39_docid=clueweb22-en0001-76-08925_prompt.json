Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY SHOULD THE MINIMUM WAGE BE INCREASED2Argumentative Essay Should the minimum wage be increased?
If The Minimum Wage IncreaseThere are many variables over the debate of the $15 minimum wage. These variables canhelp the people who are in a struggle to help themselves and their families. If the minimum wageis raised, then it could have a positive impact on a group of people’s economic status.The $15 minimum wage increase will hit milestones regarding the minimum wage. Thisincrease would be above what this country has ever experienced. An amount of $15 in 2024 ismuch more than what it would have been back in 2016 (Bernstein, Spielberg para. 2). In the1960s the minimum wage was around 50 percent of the median. The increase in 2024 will putthe minimum wage close to 60 percent of the median, which is unprecedented (para. 2).The Raise the Wage Act would disproportionately benefit people who need it. Someworkers will benefit from this raise changing their way of life for the better. Of the workers whowould benefit from the raise, 55 percent come from families with incomes currently lower than$50,000 a year (para. 3).Some people need this minimum wage increase just to get by. MIT researchers havecalculated that, on average, each of the two adults in a family of four needs a full-time job payingat least $15.80 an hour to make ends meet (para. 3). Not only that, but in the lowest-wage state inthe nation, Mississippi, a single parent with one child would need $20.74 per hour to get by(para. 3). This increase may help single parents who are in need of help to get by. Research byDavid Cooper, Larry Mishel, and Ben Zipperer shows that the increase could lead to some low-wage workers ending up with higher annual earnings while working fewer hours over the courseof a year (para. 4). This effect can help single parents work and take care of their children.

ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY SHOULD THE MINIMUM WAGE BE INCREASED3The economic effects that would be put into place could be positive. The employee of ajob may be saving up for an item that they want, so they worked for it. With the minimum wageincrease, economic stimulus is put into play, allowing employees to spend more as they continueto work for what they want in their life (Halvorson para. 2). Inflation will continue to rise overtimes. To account for inflation the minimum wage must be raised (para. 2).Some may say that the workers who are paid the minimum are mostly teens working forextra money. Actually, the average of the ages of the workers who would be affected by the billis 36, not teens (Bernstein, Spielberg para. 7). Even if this was true, shouldn’t the situation befocused on the workers who need this raise to help them in their struggle?As I have explained, there are different variables to the $15 minimum wage, for theincrease could affect communities economically, socially, and could even break some oldmilestones. The $15 minimum wage is a good thing, for it affects people positively. The $15minimum wage can clearly help a group of people who actually need it through their struggle.All over the country, the federal minimum wage has been a subject of debate. In theUnited States, the policy was introduced in 1938 during the Great Depression under PresidentDelano Roosevelt. At first, the United States Congress set the rates at $0.25 per hour. Since then,the rates have been raised and currently stands at $7.25 an hour; according to the 2009 federalgovernment mandate. As of January 2018, 29 states have complied as most of them have aminimum wage higher than the required. In fact, Washington has the highest minimum wage of$11.50 per hour. This paper seeks to analyze two contrasting perspectives in order to establishwhether the country should consider raising the minimum wage.Economists have been leading the discussion on minimum wage. Some of them areworried that the process of raising the minimum wage is dividing the country in terms of income.
ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY SHOULD THE MINIMUM WAGE BE INCREASED4Others of the contrary opinion believe that the process of increasing minimum wage could act asan economic boost. People from both sides use economic studies and data to back their ideas.The following are the main viewpoints:Advantages of Raising Minimum WageProponents of higher minimum wage share the idea that the current $7.25 per hour is stilllow. They state that higher wage will encourage job creation which by extension will lead toeconomic growth. Furthermore, they associate the cause of wage inequality to the decliningvalue of the minimum wage. According to Collins (2017), if the minimum rate is raised from$7.25 an hour to $10.10 the United States economy could attract the creation of over 85,000 newjobs and a net income of $22.1 billion in over a three-year phase. Current studies reveal that mostpoor Americans do not have enough money to save. Therefore, an increase in minimum wagewill mean that the country will increase its general cash flow hence more money being directedto entrepreneurial developments. Moreover, with more money, people can afford to cater to theirbasic needs such as food and housing and thereby less disparity.Disadvantages of Raising Minimum WageOpponents of the increase to the minimum wage cite the kind possible effects it couldhave on employers, especially small and medium enterprises. In a free market, if companies areforced to oblige to a high minimum wage, they will have to make adjustments in order tomeasure up. This may result in slower economic growth and decreased rates of employment.According to Neumark (2017), raising the minimum wage pushes businesses to find ways tomake up for the loss of capital. The most common way to offset such kinds of deficits is eitherthrough employee layoffs or by increasing prices on consumer products and services. A studycarried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland established that middle and low-income
ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY SHOULD THE MINIMUM WAGE BE INCREASED5workers consider minimum wage a positive move. However, the fact is that the wage increasereduces their chances of employment, work hours, and general earned income (Eisenbeis et al.164).ConclusionRaising the country's minimum wage could be the right way to go. However, in order tomake the shift attract positive effects, there is a need for proper policies. The government needsto consider elements such as; job training, stronger labor protections, and most importantly thegaping of the inequality issues. Furthermore, higher wages should not be based on the generosityof an employer or their location. If this is done, raised minimum wage has the potential ofchanging the lives of over 2 million Americans who live below the poverty level.
