Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Universal basic income: Wales' trial 'should include everyone'

Universal basic incomes gives a regular sum to everyone, regardless of their income

Supporters of universal basic income have called for a trial in Wales to include everyone living in a test area.

UBI pays everyone a fixed sum, regardless of their circumstances.

The Welsh government has said its small trial could involve people leaving the care system.

In an open letter to the first minister, signatories, including the future generations commissioner, said it needed to cover geographical areas for it to be an effective test.

Trials have taken place in Finland and California, with a 12-year project running in Kenya.

Critics argue it would be better to invest in better public services or existing benefits and point to the cost of applying a scheme across a whole country.

But in their letter, supporters said the welfare system was "not fit for purpose".

They said specific geographical areas, such as council wards, should be used alongside the proposals for those leaving care.

In that way, they argue, the potential benefits and pitfalls could be assessed.

Some high profile celebrities, including billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, have backed the idea, while the UK Labour Party said it would explore a pilot of UBI in its 2019 general election manifesto.

'Horrible, horrible situation'

Phillip Easton lives in Penrhiwceiber, Rhondda Cynon Taf, an area with high rates of child poverty.

He runs a business selling hot chocolate, but when he was setting it up, he had a stroke.

He said the security blanket of UBI would have made a real difference.

"During that time, because I was doing little things, I was not able to claim universal credit, but I was in a horrible, horrible situation back then and if I could have just taken that time at the beginning of my business and sit back and properly take care of myself it would have been a very different situation.

"There's been a couple of points in my life where guaranteed money - where I don't really have to think about it - would have been really, really handy, especially after the stroke.

"It's left me with a couple of issues with the brain, I can't deal with paperwork easily, especially if it's new paperwork and those forms are not very easy and when lockdown came around and I potentially could have claimed for universal credit, I didn't."

Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said keeping people well "means doing new things to tackle poverty".

"It's time to accept the system is broken and, without a stronger safety net, generations to come will be left with a legacy of deprivation.

"UBI could protect not just those hit hard by Covid but every one of us from other shocks to come - like the climate emergency that's going to cause more devastation via extreme weather like heatwaves and floods."

Other signatories include Jonathan Rhys Williams, co-founder of UBI Lab Wales, Guy Standing, co-founder of Basic Income Earth Network, Cerys Furlong, chief executive of gender equality charity Chwarae Teg and Catherine Fookes, director of Women's Equality Network Wales.

The Welsh government says it is important to get the trial right

A Welsh government spokeswoman said it would listen to key stakeholders and was already working with Ms Howe's office.

"We have closely followed the progress of pilots around the world with interest and believe there is an opportunity to test a version in Wales," she said.

"We understand the excitement and the interest around this policy, however, it is important that we get it right - there is more work to be done in this area but we are interested in developing a version, potentially first involving people leaving care."

The UK government said it has no plans to follow suit.

"It would not incentivise work, target those most in need in society, or work for those who need more support, such as disabled people and those with caring responsibilities," a spokesman said about UBI in May.
