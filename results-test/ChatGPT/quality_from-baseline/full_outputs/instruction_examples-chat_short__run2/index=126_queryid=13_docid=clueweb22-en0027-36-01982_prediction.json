        "content": "The argument in the text is that renewable energy will replace fossil fuels because they will be less expensive, more reliable, and as convenient as fossil fuels. The author claims that the latent market for renewables is already in place, and while there are barriers to the transition, young people, who tend to have the strongest support for renewable energy, will eventually replace the views of fossil fuel oriented individuals. The author acknowledges that government incentives might be needed to accelerate the process. Overall, the argument is well-written and logical. Therefore, the rhetorical argument quality of the text is high."
