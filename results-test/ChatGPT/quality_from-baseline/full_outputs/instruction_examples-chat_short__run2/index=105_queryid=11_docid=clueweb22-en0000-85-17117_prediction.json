        "content": "This text presents a clear argument in favor of accepting the use of performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports. It outlines the opposing viewpoint, which argues that athletes using drugs gain an unfair advantage over their competitors and may pressure others into using them as well, but ultimately makes the case that the growing prevalence of these drugs in society and the increasing technological advancements of sports make their use inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing. Overall, this argument is likely medium to high in terms of rhetorical quality, as it presents clear points and supports them with reasoning and evidence."
