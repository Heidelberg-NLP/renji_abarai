Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Is drinking milk good for relieving anxiety? - Quora
Probiotics, but quality matters. Our experts recently listed the top five probiotic brands for 2022.
10 Answers

Besides the homey warmth of this true comfort food, milk has loads of B vitamins that reduce anxiety and improve mood. For instance, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) raises serotonin levels to perk you up.

Not in a clinically therapeutic sense, but if it helps you, go for it.

If drinking milk or having any dairy lessen anxiety or depression for you somewhat reliably you actually have a diagnosis. Probability well over 80%.

This is what happens:

Milk or any dairy can trigger an allergic reaction. If this is a strong reaction and clearly happening due to the diary you know already what is going on. Unpleasant but straight forward. Modern medicine knows its way around that very well, get an ambulance, see a doctor get to a hospital. such reactions can be severe and even deadly.

BUT!

Allergic reactions come in many forms, at many levels and at any age. Which can be devious

Modern medicine knows its way around that very well, get an ambulance, see a doctor get to a hospital. such reactions can be severe and even deadly.

BUT!

Allergic reactions come in many forms, at many levels and at any age. Which can be devious. Part of any allergic reaction is an anaphaleptic reaction and part of that is the fight - flight - freeze - response, commonly called “stress”. Part of the fight - flight - freeze - response, which comes with some Adrenalin as well as a tightening of blood vessels via the nervous system and here the small ones, the capillaries are of most concern. (Bernoulli does not like small holes! See Bernoulli's principle - Wikipedia, ev. ask an engineer for explanation - not a doctor -this is a critical point!)

A nearly imperceptible allergic reaction will only pep you up a little bit (Adrenalin, tight capillaries, blood pressure a bit up, . . . ) and if you are depressed or anxious you feel better because of it.

But this is short term gain and long term loss. As that little pickup is an allergic reaction the body has to deal with the aftermath, you can’t sleep, you feel sluggish in the morning, can’t wake up and the like. Like anxiety and depression!

But being out of being depressed or anxious is very, very pleasant and as we don’t know we think it’s harmless, or even good for us. Milk is healthy! Or so we are told. Well, not always. A glass of milk with honey can be good to fall asleep, but if that is the calcium, the magnesium or a well disguised allergic reaction is a very difficult question.

The loop from being uplifted by the allergic reaction early and short with being down trodden and heavy in the aftermath makes things worse over time. Cheese and dairy become a habit and over time an addiction.

If the cycle happens more and more often, as we go for that little pickup the immune system increases its reactions and the ways how it reacts. Over time reactions can appear very different, and to be “something else”.

Well, it can be deadly. A good friend of my wife had reliably a full blown severe anaphaleptic reaction to goats milk. Not to cows milk. And no matter how much she watched out it happened on rare occasion, like during her wedding in Greece. She was quickly enough in an ambulance and survived.

For most of us cows milk is the major problem and goats milk is by far less so. But we can be a little bit or life threatening severely allergic to about any compound, not just lactose which is in any dairy. Even just water I read lately can cause a rash fast to some. It’s puzzling and a lot of sensationalism is going round the literature too just to confuse the many issues even more.

But there are more ways how dairy can kill us:

The above image is just statistical correlation, that it happened to me and luckily I wasn’t alone surely has an influence on me bringing this up here - but neither is proof, but either are strong hints to check things out well. Whereas the steps mentioned further above are well documented science, but are not in a form that leads to sufficient awareness in common medical practice.

The occurrence of waking up lathered in sweat has a strong correlation to dairy trouble but dairy trouble comes with gluten trouble because there is a physiological connection, being inflamed gut lining, stunted and missing villi. One causes the other and once this loop is in full swing more and more auto immune trouble, allergies, food intolerances and finally auto immune disease follow. There is no reliable way to find out as faint allergies show insufficiently on tests or not at all. But there is a well known and well established way to deal with it. A period of fasting followed by some weeks of a clean diet where gluten- and dairy- free to start with are a must to find out.

Allergies don’t get better - only worse. I ate all my life dairy, love cheese, and it took 30 years for that to be a major part of what dropped me into lots of misery. Just when that happens leaving just dairy out doesn’t do much because landing in auto immune disease needs a lot more to be addressed with it just adequately, let alone heal it.

What weighs most is that no old culture has untreated dairy, usually fermented like Kefir, Yogurt, cheese or sour milk. This “processing” breaks most of the proteins up which are the most common culprits.

Milk can relief anxiety - but if that’s good is to be investigated.

Has anybody tried using fasting as a depression treatment? If so, did it help? Again, old cultures did that and it works for depression and even anger too.

In my opinion. On its own, no, a glass of milk won’t relieve anxiety. A warm glass before bed may be a little calming, but likely won’t greatly impact clinical anxiety on its own. It could help a bit, and certainly can’t hurt (assuming the person isn’t lactose sensitive or intolerant.

Anxiety is a clinical disorder that requires a multifaceted approach to treatment. As a holistic psychotherapist, I do promote a whole food diet as piece of the treatment protocol. I advocate avoidance of processed foods, excessive gluten, alcohol, and caffeine, as they may increase anxiety symptoms.

Proper amounts

Proper amounts of sleep & exercise, practicing meditation/self-hypnosis, and cognitive-behavioral therapy are the other important components.

Reducing stress can be as simple as drinking more water, pouring a glass of warm milk before bed, or sipping a cup of tea throughout the day. These drinks and more can help reduce stress levels by relaxing your muscles, reducing your body's level of stress hormones, and lowering your blood pressure.

A protein found in milk is the latest treatment for stress. The protein, lactium, appears to have a calming effect on the body by lowering blood pressure and reducing levels of cortisol, a hormone released when the body is stressed.

Chronic stress is linked to a range of conditions, including depression and heart disease. Scientists first began studying the stress-busting qualities of milk over 20 years ago, spurred on by the observation that babies become calm and settled after feeding on milk.

Stress-reducing: The protein, lactium, found in milk, appears to have a calming effect on the body by lowering blood pressure

Tests suggested that a protein - casein - played a key role.

But adults, with their more mature digestive system, would need to drink impossibly large quantities of milk for the same benefit. Now a French company, Ingredia Nutritional, has developed the protein into lactium, a highly concentrated form.
