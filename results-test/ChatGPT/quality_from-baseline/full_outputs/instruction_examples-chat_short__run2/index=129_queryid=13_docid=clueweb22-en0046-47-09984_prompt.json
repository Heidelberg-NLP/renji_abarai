Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Alternative Resources for Energy Instead of Fossil Fuels Essay

Satisfactory Essays
Alternative resources for energy are being used instead of fossil fuels being used .Fossil fuels create greenhouse gases which accumulate in the atmosphere and harms it. Some alternative options for getting energy are using solar, hydro, and wind power. Not only are these alternatives better for the environment they can still be used when fossil fuels run out. Solar energy is one of the alternatives to fossil fuels. Solar energy is used to create electricity in two ways. The first process is using sunlight to heat up water that creates high-pressure steam that spins turbine blades. The second process involves the movement and displacement of electrons to absorb the sun's radiation and create electricity (Energy Kids). Solar energy can be…show more content…
The turbines transform 2/3 of the energy in wind into electricity; which is more than fossil fuels transform. One downside to using wind power is that the turbines stand out and ruin the beauty of natural lands. Wind power is environment friendly and generates lots of power for people. Many places have started to use hydro power because many areas have become hotter and wetter. To work hydro power relies on the water cycle, and it harnesses the mechanical energy from moving water. Most of hydro power comes from reservoirs, but sometimes running rivers are used. The amount of available energy in moving water is determined by its flow or fall (Energy Kids). The water flows through a pipe, or penstock, then pushes against and turns blades in a turbine to spin a generator to produce electricity (Energy Kids). In a run-of-the-river system, the force of the current applies the needed pressure, while in a storage system, water is accumulated in reservoirs created by dams, then released as needed to generate electricity (Energy Kids). Hydroelectric dams burn no fuel, and release no polluting gases that can cause environmental powers. Hydro power is used by many countries and is friendly to the environment. Having alternative energy resources that are friendly to the environment is important for the future to have less pollution. The amount of greenhouse gases that get released into the
