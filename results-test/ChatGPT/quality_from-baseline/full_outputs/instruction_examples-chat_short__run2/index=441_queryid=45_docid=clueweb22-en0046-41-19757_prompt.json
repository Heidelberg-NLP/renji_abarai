Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

10 Facts About Pennies… (Trust Me, This Is Worth Every Penny!)

While attempting to find the value of rare pennies for some of our loyal readers, I came across some interesting info about pennies in general.

Just thought I’d share…

Did you know?…

#1 – The average penny lasts 30 years!

#2 – Pennies were the very first coins minted in the United States. In March 1793, the mint distributed 11,178 copper cents. (The amount of copper and zinc in the penny has changed significantly through the years.)

“Every penny counts.”

#3 – There have been 11 different designs featured on the penny.

#4 – The Lincoln penny was first minted and circulated in 1909, the 100th anniversary of his birth.

#5 – Lincoln faces to the right, while all other portraits on coins face to the left. This was not done on purpose — it was simply the choice of the coin designer.

#6 – In a coin toss, I always choose tails. Here’s why. (…although the U.S. Mint disputes this theory)

“A penny saved is a penny earned.”

#7 – The penny was the first U.S. coin to have the motto “IN GOD WE TRUST”. (Clarification: see Ben’s comment below.)

#8 – Lincoln pennies made from 1909 to 1958 were designed by Victor D. Brenner. His initials V.D.B. were on a limited quantity of the 1909 pennies making it one of the most sought after pennies for collecting.

Listen to some little-known facts from NPR audio about Frank Gasparro, an engraver at the U.S. Mint whose Lincoln Memorial design has graced the “tails” side of the penny since 1959 (…Lincoln’s 150th birthday. The same year they replaced the wheat shafts on the back of the penny with the Lincoln Memorial).

#9 – Each year, the U.S. Mint produces more than 7 billion pennies. That’s approximately 19 million pennies per day! 

#10 – Over two-thirds of all coins produced by the U.S. Mint are pennies. In fact, the penny is the most widely used denomination currently in circulation and it remains profitable to make. Each penny costs .81 of a cent to make, but the Mint collects one cent for it. The profit goes to help fund the operation of the Mint and to help pay the public debt.

“It’s worth every penny.”

A recent poll by Opinion Research Corporation found that approximately 70% of Americans support keeping the penny in circulation. (NOTE: elimination of the penny would lead to higher prices, since prices would then be rounded to the nearest 5 cents.)
