Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Bottled Water Be Banned in Schools?

It's estimated that 30 billion single-serving bottles of water are gulped down each year in the United State.  Some people think that bottled water is good however some people know that bottled water is just purified tap water.  I think bottled water should be banned in schools. 


There are many reasons why bottled water should be banned.  One reason why bottled water should be banned is from knowing that 25% of bottled water is tap.  In the CNN video, Most Bottled Water is Tap, one lady said that she was bamboozled and hoodwinked.  Another lady said that she would never drink Aquafina after realizing that Aquafina doesn't come from a spring or reservoir like the brand name says.  Another reason why bottled should be banned is because it is bad for the environment.  The Mayor from California said in an article Goodbye, Bottled Water “More than one billion plastic water bottles end up in California’s landfill each year, taking 100 years to biodegrade and leaking toxic additives such as phthalates into the groundwater.”  This quote is showing that plastic water bottles don’t biodegrade as easily.  Tap water doesn't biodegrade at all.  The final reason why bottled water should be banned is because some bottled water is expensive.  Brands like Fuji cost 8 dollars or more in hotels.


On the other hand, some people think that bottled water shouldn’t be banned in schools.  One reason why people think that bottled water shouldn't be banned in schools is because we should have an opinion whether to drink bottled water or tap.  By banning bottled water, it takes away the option to choose their choice of beverage. However, bottled water is too expensive to drink. Most of  the bottled water is tap and takes 1,000 years to biodegrade. Bottled water also leaks toxic additives into the groundwater, which is where people get their tap water from.


As you can see bottled water should be banned in schools.  Bottled water is bad for the environment, expensive and really just glorified tap water.  In fact, Martha Coakley already banned bottled water in Concord Massachusetts. We need your help to make sure that bottled water is banned from schools.

Bs. Bottled water is for the convenience of having water on the go. Like "going" to school. It should be allowed everywhere. The author of this was paid to write this, or was just brainwashed into stupid ways of thinking.
