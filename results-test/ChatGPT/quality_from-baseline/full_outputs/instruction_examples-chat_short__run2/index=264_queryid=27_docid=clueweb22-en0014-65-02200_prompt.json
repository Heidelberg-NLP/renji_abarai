Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Reasons Why There Should Be Stricter Gun Control Laws

This passage is about why there should be stricter gun control laws. I will give off tons of evidence that should prove that gun control laws should be stricter.

Dear Next President, 

Guns are very dangerous objects and should not be allowed on the streets. I get it if you use a firearm to hunt or you are a policeman, but if you aren't any of those things, then why would you need a gun? Lots of deaths are caused by gun violence. According to Johns Hopkins Center For Gun Policy And Research, "more than 31,000 people a year in the United States die from gunshot wounds." Not are deaths caused by a firearm traumatic and scary, but they also cost a lot too. According to Johns Hopkins Center For Gun Policy And Research, " When lost quality of life, psychological and emotional trauma, decline in property values, and other legal and societal consequences are included, the cost of gun violence in the U.S was estimated to be about $100 billion annually in 1998." That means that we have to pay higher taxes for gun violence. If the laws were stricter about gun control, then we shouldn't have these problems. 

Gun control laws should be stricter, especially for the fault of kids. Kids are getting into their parent's/guardian's firearms, and some not so good results have came from that. Most kids don't know how to use a gun. Adam Lidgett was informed on a horrific story involving a kid with a gun from a lady named Misty Uribe. "It was a gorgeous Sunday in March when Misty Uribe's son one of his neighborhood friends accidentally get shot in the face", she said. " Uribe never thought an eight year old boy next door would find a loaded rifle in his family shed, take it outside during a cops and robbers game, and shoot a boy", she said. "Uribe's son was shaking from head to toe". Uribe did not think it was a real gun. She thought it was a nerf gun or bb gun. Uribe's son kept on saying,"no mommy, it was a real gun." Not only parents, but kids can be scarred from deadly incidents with guns. Luckily, in the incident above, the child who was shot with the loaded rifle did not end up passing away. Think of how scarred you would be if you saw one of your neighborhood friends getting shot at the age of eight. 

A lot of people who are against making gun control laws stricter will try to tell you that guns are used for self defence in mass shootings. Well, according to procon.org,"between 2007 to 2011 0.79% of victims (235,700) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of firearm." That proves that a low percentage of people actually protects themself. Also, if there were stricter gun control laws, there would be fewer suicides. According to procon.org, " between 1999 and 2013, there were 270, 237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for 52% of all suicides during those years." Both of those facts add up to one thing. Gun control laws should be stricter. 

I really hope that those three paragraphs opened your mind up about why gun control laws should be stricter. Whoever you are, Trump or Hillary, I hope you make gun control laws stricter. I get it if you are a policeman or a hunter, but if you are neither one of those, then why would you need a gun?
