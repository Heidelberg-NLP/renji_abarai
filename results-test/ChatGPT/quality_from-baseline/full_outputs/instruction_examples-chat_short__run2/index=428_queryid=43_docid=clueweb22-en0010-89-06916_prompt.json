Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should Single-Use Plastics Be Banned?

It isn’t about taking away a “healthy option,” it’s about providing a sustainable future

Congratulations, America! You made bottled water your drink of choice according to the percentages.

bottled water consumption in the U.S. | PATHWATER

Consumers make their voices heard every time they bring a reusable bottle from home instead of buying a single-use plastic water bottle. Or, if they have to buy something when they are out, they choose the aluminum, paper, or glass option of bottled water because those options use fewer petroleum resources and are more often recycled than plastic.

 

Great statement, but it’s too quiet for the world to hear.

 

Unless legislators step in to shift the burden of plastic pollution on to the producers of that plastic, all of the efforts we make every day to cut our dependence on plastic fall short. A policy change is the only way to make a real change in the plastic pollution crisis. Just check out The City of San Francisco’s Ban on single-use plastic water bottles.

Myth busting the arguments against a single-use plastic water bottle BAN

Myth #1 A ban on plastic bottled water takes away a healthy option.

Why this is nonsense: We have plastic bottle water alternatives in the form of glass, paper, and reusable aluminum bottles like PATHWATER. Not to mention, more and more buildings are making water refill stations a standard.

 

Myth #2 There is no viable alternative.

Why this is nonsense: The options on the market for bottled water are growing. While many are single-use, they are still not plastic. Currently, the reusable options are glass bottles, until they shatter and must be recycled, and PATHWATER, which is durable and meant for long-term refilling.

 

Myth #3 Other types of beverages have plastic containers that are more harmful than plastic water bottles.

Why this is nonsense: Water is the #1 beverage sold in the U.S. With that said, it has the most room for improvement where waste is concerned. The fact is, we shouldn’t be manufacturing any single-use plastic bottles. All plastics carry a health threat that is not totally understood as of yet. More in-depth research is needed; however, even if the smallest risk is their estrogenic effect, plastics actively change the chemicals in our body through ingestion via beverages and mimic estrogen hormones in the body.

Myth #4 Bans don't necessarily reduce waste.

Why this is nonsense: Bans on single-use plastic water bottles make them obsolete. And, because they are an inferior water carrying container, they will cease to be sold and purchased in mass quantities. Bans force people to reconsider their bad choices and make room for better solutions to take their place -- which is why bans are a great solution to reduce plastic waste.

 

Myth #5 Bottled water is a practical emergency water supply.

Why this is nonsense: This is a true statement. It’s a great idea to have sealed water containers in every emergency kit. There is zero need for those bottles of water to be plastic. In fact, plastic is not the ideal bottle if there is an emergency, as they are easily crushed and not very durable.

 

Myth #6 Banning bottled water restricts consumers' access to a product they want.

Why this is nonsense: Consumers don’t have to give up bottled water. But most people agree manufacturers are responsible for making products that keep people and the planet safe and healthy. Plastic water bottles fail in this area but other water bottles made out of glass, paper, and reusable aluminum bottles like PATHWATER, are still available for a convenient replacement.

 

Myth #7 Negatively affects small businesses.

Why this is nonsense: Small business that sells plastic water bottles have a high-profit margin on them. Plastic water bottles are a cheap source of revenue, and that money swims all the way upstream to the oil companies that frack for the oil needed to make the bottles. Small businesses have an opportunity to help their community by offering plastic-free bottled water options that will continue to provide high-profit margins but also take care of the planet. This is a positive effect on small businesses and their communities.
