Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Pelosi Defends Members of Congress Trading Stocks: It’s a ‘Free Market’

1333 comments

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Wednesday she believed members of Congress should be allowed to trade stocks despite ethical questions, citing the “free market.”

Pelosi, who routinely makes headlines with her husband for their prophetic ability to making winning trades, made the comment in response to a reporter who asked about a Business Insider story based on a five-month review that found a large number of lawmakers and their staffers had been late filing financial disclosures detailing their trades. “Should members of Congress and their spouses be banned from trading individual stocks while serving in Congress?” the reporter asked.

“No,” Pelosi replied. “We have a responsibility to report on the stock, but I’m not familiar with that five-month review. But if people aren’t reporting, they should be.”

The reporter persisted amid muffled crosstalk after Pelosi finished, prompting her to add, “Because this is a free market. We’re a free-market economy. They should be able to participate in that.”

Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, both 81, most recently made news for their trading activity in January, when they purchased between $500,000 and $1 million in call options in Tesla stock at a strike price of $500.The stock hit a new historical high last month in excess of $1,200. And last year, by one estimate, the couple made a 45.59 percent return on stocks, along with a 66.7 percent return on options trading.

Pelosi was worth $115 million in 2020, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, up from $41 million in 2004. She was first elected to Congress in 1987, when members received a salary of $89,500, and first elected speaker in 2007. She presently draws a salary of $223,500 from that position.

Business Insider’s Wednesday report found 49 members of Congress, along with 182 Capitol Hill staffers, who were late to submit disclosures about their trades in 2020 and 2021, which are required under the STOCK Act. They face a $200 fine for first offenses under the law, an amount that can increase over time. However, congressional ethics staff refused to confirm whether any of the rogue traders had been fined.
