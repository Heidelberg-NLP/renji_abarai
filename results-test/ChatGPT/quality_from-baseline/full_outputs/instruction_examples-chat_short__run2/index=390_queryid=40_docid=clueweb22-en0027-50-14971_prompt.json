You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Todays feminism isn't needed, They have no rights that they need to fight for, And are establishing a bad name for feminism, As if when some of them think that all men should die and that sort. Women have the same rights as men do, So change my mind.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

There are all kinds of beauty contests for boys as well. They are similar to girl beauty contests in many ways. And, there are other types of beauty-related contests for men, judging their handsomeness and bodies. So beauty contests are not exclusive to females.

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Should the death penalty be allowed? | Debate.org
  • Ban the death penalty!

    The death penalty should be banned because sometimes the innocent person is killed. The death penalty shouldn't be allowed because in the 8th amendment it says "No Cruel and Unusual Punishments". In 2011 Troy Davis was killed for a crime that he committed 22 years ago and they killed him with the Death Penalty. What if it were you that committed a crime? What if they put you up for death penalty? Would you like it? It's time for a change in our government

  • Defiantly no question about it!

    Put it this way, if you were a child and you were raped by an older person, how would feel towards the person who took your human rights and physically took advantage of you. You would obviously want them dead because they ruined your life and now you are morally ruined. So if you are on the 'no' side, put yourselves in the shoes of victims who have went through what I have just explained.

  • The cost

    The U.S. government spends millions of taxpayers dollars to keep these lowlife convicts in prison! Any suspect found of murder/rape should ultimately be put down! It's not the taxpayers fault that they messed up and they should be put to rest and be treated like all of the other scum in the world that was killed for wrong doings.

  • Of course it should be

    What about those serial killers. What about the serial rapist? Do you really want those people on this earth. If they cant control themselves during the time they were free, they should not be allowed to remain part of society and get what they deserve for all the pain they have caused other.

  • The death penalty should be allowed, and I think, should be used more often.

    The Bible says that the government doesn't bear the sword in vain and it is its right and duty to punish felons.
    I think the U.S. government today is not feared enough by criminals because the penalty for certain serious crimes is not severe enough.

  • The death penalty should be allowed, because it's an effective way to ban criminals.

    Criminals would think twice before committing their crimes if death penalty exists. If they know they may face death for what they do, they may change their minds and give up on committing any crime.

  • The death penalty should be applied, because it is a just punishment for horrific crimes.

    The Christian Bible has the solution, "an eye for an eye". Let the punishment fit the crime. If you take a life, you forfeit your life. Some criminals are so far beyond any hope of redemption that the only way to control them is to terminate their life. If a terrorist is sentenced to life in prison, he will only recruit more terrorists from the prison population. Executing the terrorist would be a nice way of saying, "mass murder is not acceptable in our society".

  • Yes

    The death penalty is necessary, because some people are so vile they can never be in contact with society without harming it in some way. Truly evil people do exist and they harm others - sometimes killing or ruining lives through their actions. This is not something that should be acceptable or allowed to continue without punishment to deter others with a like mentality.

  • The death penalty is actually a good answer to help solve some serious issues we are facing

    With 7 billion people on the earth and the earth only being able to support between 2-3 billion long term, it is our responsibility to find the most sensible and humane ways to reduce the population before the issue becomes drastically worse in the future. The death penalty eliminates people who have proven to be a burden on society. Time and space is precious to waste of the individuals that have completely proven to make the world a worse place. Also, the cost of incarceration is growing out of hand, about $200 BILLION a year for the USA alone. Cutting out the expense of a few of the worst life-time prisoners could help with that ridiculous expense.

  • The death penalty should be allowed because those who kill innocent people should pay for it with their own lives.

    The death penalty should be allowed as an acceptable punishment for those who kill innocent people. Taxpayers should not have to pay for a killer to spend the rest of their lives not working, watching cable tv, and working out. The killer took an innocent life and should not be given any of the privileges and luxuries that they took away from the victim.

  • No one deserves to die!

    The death penalty should not be allowed because God created this world for us to live and he will pick when we die. I do believe that if you do a really bad sin then you should go to jail but not die. Even if you go to jail you get fed and you have a bathroom. Yes, I know that there are people that disagree with me, but this is what I believe. What about you?

  • No

    Death is too good for them. They should be tortured for the rest of their lives. Death is way too quick and simple. Innocent people unfortunately always get the punishment for some reason while the criminals just get away with it. It's not fair. Torture is the best and most suitable punishment. Also it is not worth taking the risk of accidentally executing the wrong person.

  • Why I disagree with the Death Penalty

    First and foremost, THOU SHALL NOT KILL. I am not minimizing the reality of crime that occurs within our society, but when someone commits such a grievous crime such as murder, I do not believe that they should have their own life taken from them. I agree with life in prison without Parole is reasonable, but lethal injection is not right. The only one who has the right to take life is God himself.

  • The death penalty is too idealistic

    Here are the facts. Killing someone is more expensive than keeping them in jail. The (legal) form of execution is lethal injection. This process is not especially painful to the "killer," therefore, there is little retribution in that. To feel truly sorry is a far more painful thing, the killers should spend the rest of their droll, mentally burdensome lives thinking about what they did, they still have a chance to save their soles and die with a clear conscience. If nothing else, a good number of years in one place without the chance to get out is good enough punishment.

    In response to the bible "quote," no human has the right to decide who lives and who dies. Period.

  • It should never be legalized.

    We as humans need to protect and help one another, however with everything in our society, I understand that to some people the death penalty should be legalized. But who are we to play God, to kill those we deem deserve death? We are hypocrites if we kill a murder, what would be next? Raping a rapist? It must be taken in perspective, yes, it's only used in extreme cases, but even in Sweden there is a prison where the maximum sentence is 12 years, they use their resources to educate and help the prisoners. The prisoners come out of there well educated and do not go back to hurting others. This should be considered, after all, we are humans, and it is not morally correct to kill other humans.

  • No, it is morally wrong.

    It's a very controversial topic, and in a way, it will make people think twice before committing a crime. But everyone has the right to life and no one should ever be subjected to this kind of extreme punishment, no matter how guilty they are, they still have the right to life just like everyone else. Also, the death penalty is basically like getting revenge, rather than making someone feel guilty of their mistake...it's just morally wrong. Besides, who is the government to decide whether or not someone to die? They're not God.

  • It doesn't work.

    The death penalty is expensive, does not deter crimes, and morally wrong. Many people say that an execution is simply a rope or a bullet; $5 is all it takes. However, in reality it costs millions upon millions of dollars due to court hearings and whatnot. Life imprisonment costs considerably less. It has been proven that the death penalty does not deter crimes. Go compare the murder rates of the US to Canada and Europe. Lastly, everyone should be entitled a right to life. Just because one person violated someone else's right doesn't mean it's correct for the nation to sink down to the murderer's level.

  • Stop Death Penalties

    No, it is not an appropriate form of punishment because states conclude that they waste hundreds of millions of dollars on the death penalty, draining state budgets during the economic crisis and diverting funds from more effective anti-violence programs. The Number of U.S states with death penalty:35 $1,471,200,000 wasted on executions since 1976. In 1999, 98.

  • Death penalty will only lead to more violence

    During the summer of 2011, large riots kicked off in the UK. These riots were caused by policemen shooting a man who was loose with a gun. With the death penalty, not only can you wrongly convict a criminal, but a wrong conviction of a gang member has the potential to spark off huge riots, only increasing crime rate.
