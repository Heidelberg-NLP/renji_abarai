Your task is to predict in a given text the rhetorical argument quality, i.e. "well-writtennes": (1) whether the document contains arguments and whether the argument text has a good style of speech, (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to follow, (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, etc.
You should return one of the three labels: "high", "medium" and "low".



Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Obesity is a Chronic Disease | Rethink Obesity®

Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease1,2

Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease, but is often not treated the same as other conditions in this category.1,2

Obesity is a serious, chronic, and progressive condition that requires long-term medical management.1,2

Chart of change in average weight over time in adults. Majority of adults gained greater than 1 pound per year.

Study Design

Data derived between 1990 and 2008 from 10,038 Americans with a mean baseline age of 29. Body weight was recorded 11 times, with all weight self-reported.3

Obesity is not treated in the same way that other chronic and progressive diseases are treated1

Millions of adults have health challenges. Obesity is one of the most prevalent.

75M adults in the US with hypertension, 78M adults in the US with dyslipidemia who are prescribed medicine, ~100M adults in US living with obesity

People with obesity in the US have higher health care costs than those of normal weight8,9,a,b

With increased medical spending, obesity can become an economic burden on both public and private payers.

Graph depicting increased healthcare costs associated with obesity

aThe WHO defines overweight as a BMI greater than or equal to 25, while obesity is defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 30.
bHealth care costs associated with obesity are mostly due to treating obesity-related comorbidities.

Correct!

Sorry, that's incorrect.

A weight loss of 5% could save patients with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2 an estimated $2,137 annually.11

Correct!

Sorry, that's incorrect.

A 20-year-old with obesity will incur an additional societal cost of $28,020 more than a normal-weight peer in their lifetime.12
