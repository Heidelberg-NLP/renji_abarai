Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. This would obviously require so much hard work for it to ever come true but I believe that we could do it, if we joined together as one. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one. We would be greater, richer and smarter. What do you people think?

Beauty pageants are not trying to sexualize children. They are judging children on their beauty and how beautifully they dress and are "made up". Some parents might aim for "sexy", but this does not mean this is a winning formula; it would usually be considered offensive if there was such an over the top attempt. In general, contestants are going for classy, sophisticated, cute, adorable, even if they're only 5 years old.

Higher Education Should be Free

663 words 3 page(s)

As the world economy becomes more and more driven by knowledge, obtaining a higher education has become a necessary prerequisite to reaching professional success and establishing financial security for oneself and one’s family. At the same time, however, along with demand for higher education in the professional sphere, its price has also been on the rise meaning that fewer and fewer young people from the economically disadvantaged families can afford to go to college and consequently lower their chances of building a successful career and even going up the socioeconomic ladder. Because higher education is an essential factor that allows people to move up the economic ladder and the high price of it deepens the gap between the wealthy and the poor, the government should offer free higher education for everyone which will help individual people advance and will benefit the whole society in the long run.

Higher education is the key component that allows one to build a successful career and move up the socioeconomic ladder for young people (Reed). As industries become more specialized and start looking for trained employees knowledgeable and competent in the relevant spheres, higher education becomes a key that open doors to well-paying jobs and careers that promise continuous professional development. Because it offers an opportunity to escape poverty, education is regarded as “the vehicle for closing the gap between the top and the bottom of the economic ladder” (Reed). Yet, the growing price of higher education turns it into an unattainable luxury for young people from economically disadvantaged families, thus, depriving them of an opportunity to hope for a more stable financial future even if they are determined to work hard for it.
Because higher education is such an important component of the future financial success of young people, the government should offer it for free. Although higher education is now regarded as a private commodity (Williams), it is actually more of a public good necessary to ensure that everyone has equal access to resources and opportunities.

Taking into account that current financial aid system relies mostly on loans which students have to take out without even having a guarantee that the obtained education will offer them a chance to pay them off (Govindarajan), the government should offer free education for everyone to ensure that all young people have equal chances in life.
Government-funded free education for everyone will grant all young people equal chances in succeeding in life and will benefit the whole society in the long run. Free higher education will ensure that everyone has a chance of obtaining knowledge and skills that will make them valuables employees in our increasingly knowledge-driven economy (Govindarajan). This is likely to cover the existing deficit in qualified employees in the innovative industries along with lowering the unemployment rate. Further, better educated citizens contribute to society as a whole becoming more productive, more rational, capable of making better financial decisions, less violent, and more tolerant (Williams). Hence, offering free higher education will benefit both the individual citizens and society as a whole.

Summing up, the growing price of higher education contributes to the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor as it deprives young people of the poorer families of an opportunity to build successful careers and ensure financial stability for themselves. Making higher education free will offer everyone an equal opportunity for obtaining economic well-being and will reduce the risk of young people getting into serious debt before they even start earning. In the long run, free higher education for everyone is likely to benefit individual citizens and to increase the well-being of whole society across numerous dimensions. Hence, free higher education for everyone is a real necessity for ensuring social justice and continuous economic development of our country.
