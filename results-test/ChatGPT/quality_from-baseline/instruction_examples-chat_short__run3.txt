The given text seems to be a medium-level argumentative essay discussing the controversial issue of insider trading and whether it is ethical or not. The essay presents both the sides of the arguments and provides relevant examples and references to support them. The essay argues that while insider trading can be beneficial to investors by speeding up market efficiency, it is still an illegal and unethical act. The essay also highlights the legal aspects of insider trading and the vague ethical dilemmas it poses. The author concludes the essay by suggesting that the laws should be revised to allow insiders to make their trades known to the public to ultimately benefit the market.

Neither of the arguments provided are complete. As an AI language model, I should remain neutral. However, I must note that favoring the reintroduction of corporal punishment in schools is a step backward in terms of improving the education system and creating a safe and abuse-free environment for students. The rights of the children, and the possible negative psychological effects of corporal punishment, should be taken into account. Instead of reinstating corporal punishment, teachers should be trained to educate their students in a positive and constructive manner. Like the other arguments, the actual implementation details are important, and the definition of corporal punishment that is proposed should also be considered.

This is a difficult debate as there are valid points on both sides. However, in my opinion, partial privatization of the public sector would be a good option. It could result in increased competition, better service quality, and higher efficiency. However, measures must be taken to ensure proper regulation and labor security. The government should maintain strong regulatory bodies and vigilance from the labor department to protect the interests of workers. Overall, privatization should not be done hastily, but with careful consideration and planning.

This argument is missing a clear warrant and impact, and thus cannot be considered as a valid argument.

This text presents an argument against the legalization of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. It outlines several reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea, including that many banned substances are prohibited for a reason as they can cause medical issues, it could lead to a situation where athletes go from using FDA approved substances under medical supervision to taking dangerous amounts in order to set themselves apart from others, and that substances like EPO is not available for sports use regardless of the legal status.

For the motion:

Good evening everyone. It is my firm belief that everyone should become vegetarian. There are several reasons to support this claim, including health, environmental, economic, and ethical reasons.

Firstly, vegetarianism is a healthier lifestyle choice. Research has shown that a plant-based diet can help prevent and even reverse chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. In contrast, consuming meat can lead to health problems such as obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

Secondly, adopting a vegetarian lifestyle is better for the environment. The meat industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. By reducing our consumption of meat, we can help reduce our carbon footprint and preserve natural resources.

Thirdly, being a vegetarian is often more cost-effective. Meat is often more expensive than plant-based alternatives, and a vegetarian diet can be just as nutritious and satisfying.

Finally, there are ethical reasons to consider. The modern meat industry often involves cruel and inhumane practices towards animals. By choosing a vegetarian lifestyle, we can help reduce the suffering and exploitation of these innocent creatures.

In conclusion, I urge everyone to consider becoming vegetarian. Not only is it healthier and more environmentally sustainable, but it is also a way to align our lifestyles with our ethical beliefs and values. Thank you.

This text presents arguments for and against making Election Day a national holiday in the USA. The arguments in favor suggest that making it a national holiday will increase voter turnout, turn the act of voting into a celebration of democracy and align the USA with other countries. On the other hand, the arguments against it suggest that it will disadvantage low-income and blue-collar workers, that changing state laws and private companies' policies would be more effective and that other solutions - such as automatic voter registration, early voting, among others - would increase voter participation more reliably. 

Possible discussion questions:
- What is your opinion regarding making Election Day a national holiday?

The article discusses the debate over whether homework is beneficial for students and mentions a Brooklyn school's alternative to traditional homework. There is a divide among parents as to whether homework is necessary or not. Some argue that it is important for academic achievement while others believe it is detrimental to a student's development. The article suggests finding a balance between academic and other activities. The school's solution is the "Exercise Your Brain" program, which allows students to choose from a menu of optional activities designed to engage them in learning without traditional homework. Overall, the article presents a balanced overview of the debate around homework.

This text argues that the voting age should be lowered from 18 to 16 based on several pieces of evidence. One of them is the recent activism of high school students, who demonstrated an ability to reason logically with facts and engage in thoughtful protest against gun control issues. Another argument presented in the article is the findings of studies on cold cognitive abilities. These show that by the age of 16, young people can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Finally, the writer also refers to past social change movements when the voting age was lowered, such as the one motivated by outrage over the fact that 18-year-olds could be sent to fight in Vietnam but could not vote. 

Thus, the article provides different reasons why the voting age should be lowered to 16. However, it also tries to anticipate some of the skeptics' concerns, such as the competence of 16-year-olds to make informed choices in the voting booth. While this is a valid concern, the text argues that teenagers can make decisions as valid as those of adults when it comes to cold cognition. Ultimately, the article invites students to take a position on the matter and provide additional arguments for or against lowering the legal voting age.

This article argues that police officers hitting the streets of London should be required to wear video cameras during all of their stop-and-search interactions with the public. The report, chaired by Tessa Jowell, a returning Labour MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, and Baroness Lawrence, an anti-racism campaigner whose son Stephen was murdered in 1993, recommends that police should start incorporating body-worn video cameras in all their global operations. It is accompanied by video evidence gathered over six months while working with young people across the city. The report’s release comes after a lengthy “stop and search” controversy.
