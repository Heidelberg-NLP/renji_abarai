Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Argumentative Essay : Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?

Gay marriage is a very big issue in this country. Some people believe that same-sex couples should have access to the same marriage benefits and public acknowledgement enjoyed by Heterosexual couples while other people believe that gay marriage should be illegal. In my opinion I believe that gay marriage should be legal for certain reasons. Gay marriage should be legal because it can bring financial gain to state and local government. Additionally gay marriage would make it easier for same-sex couples to adopt,providing stable homes for children who would otherwise be left in foster care. Finally Gay marriage is protected by the Constitution's commitments to liberty and equality.

Gay marriage can bring financial gain to state and local government. To begin, there is information that state that same-sex marriage can bring a lot of financial gain to the state and government. According to procon.org, “Revenue from gay marriage comes from marriage licenses, higher income taxes (the so-called ‘marriage penalty’), and decreases in costs for state benefit programs,” which clearly explains that gay marriage would decrease the amount of money the government pay for the income tax for people. Secondly, gay marriage would bring a lot of money to the city’s economy. According to procon.org, “The Comptroller for New York City found that legalizing gay marriage would bring $142 million to the city’s economy and $184 million to the state’s economy over three years.” I believe this would be a great deal to the economy because it gains more money than it should be gaining over time. So gay marriage should be legal because it brings a lot of money to the government.

Gay marriage would make it easier for same-sex couples to adopt, providing stable homes for children who would otherwise be left in foster care. Since same-sex couples can't make kids, they would adopt children who are in need of a family instead of them staying in foster care. According to Procon.org, “In the US, 100,000 children are waiting to be adopted. [44] A longitudinal study published in Pediatrics on June 7, 2010 found that children of lesbian mothers were rated higher than children of heterosexual parents in social and academic competence and had fewer social problems,” this means that if gay marriage is legalized, a lot of kids would be adopted and a very few of them would be in a foster care. Secondly, children who need to be adopted do not choose the sex of their new parents, all they need is two loving parents who would care for them no matter of their gender. The procon website states that “A July 2010 study found that children of gay fathers were ‘as well-adjusted as those adopted by heterosexual parents.’ [46] As Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein argues, "We should be begging gay couples to adopt children. We should see this as a great boon that gay marriage could bring to kids who need nothing more than two loving parents,’” These children who don't have families need parents who would care for them and most of the couples who adopt children are same-sex couples. The more gay marriage legalized the more children are out of foster care.
Gay marriage is protected by the Constitution's commitments to liberty and equality. As a start, we all have the right to do whatever we want and we all have the right to love who we want. If a person wants to marry somebody who has the same sex as them, then let I believe it should be legal because we all have freedom and equality in this country. According to the website procon.org, “The US Supreme Court ruled in 1974's Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur that the ‘freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause.’” This clearly demonstrates that we all have the freedom of doing whatever we want and nobody should stop gay people to get married because they also have their rights. Secondly,Since gay marriage is protected by the constitution’s commitments to liberty and equality, then gay marriage should already be legal because it is already protected by the laws. According to Procon.org, “US District Judge Vaughn Walker wrote on Aug. 4, 2010 that Prop. 8 in California banning gay marriage was "unconstitutional under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses." This combination means that banning gay marriage is unfair because it is already protected by United States Laws that everybody has the right to do their own personal things.
Opponents of gay marriage feel that it should be illegal because it may lead to more children being raised in same-sex households, which they claim is not an optimum environment because children need both a mother and father. First of all, this claim is inaccurate because same-sex couples adopt children who are in need of parents (the sex of the parents does not matter to them as long as they got people who loves them) According to Procon.org, Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein argues that “We should see this as a great boon that gay marriage could bring to kids who need nothing more than two loving parents." This demonstrates that children do not have to choose what kind of parents they want, as long as they have two people who loves them unconditionally .The prosecution also argues that marriage is a privilege not a right. This claim is false because gay marriage is a civil right. According To procon.org, “ The 1967 Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia confirmed that marriage is "one of the basic civil rights of man," [60] and same-sex marriages should receive the same protections given to interracial marriages by that ruling. This evidence proves that the opposing side’s claim is inaccurate because the supreme court already claimed that gay marriage is a civil right and everybody has the right to choose who they want to marry. Sex does not matter, love matters.
In conclusion, gay marriage should be legal for several reasons. First, it can bring financial gain to state and local government. Second, it would make it easier for same-sex couples to adopt, providing stable homes for children who would otherwise be left in foster care. Finally, gay marriage is protected by the Constitution's commitments to liberty and equality. On that note, everybody has the right to marry whoever they want. If America is really the place where everybody has their own freedom, and rights, then why marrying who you want is not legal? Just put yourself in their shoes. They did not choose to be different. They are also people like everyone else. Nobody has the right to discriminate people just because they’re different. So we should all stand up and help gay people get their rights. They deserve it because they’re people like everyone else.
