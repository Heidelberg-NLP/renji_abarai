Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Executive Summary

  • Acting on the Minister of National Revenue’s commitment to work to estimate the tax gap, in June 2016, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) released two reports: Tax Gap in Canada: A Conceptual Study, and Estimating and Analyzing the Tax Gap Related to the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales TaxFootnote 1.
    • The first report examined key considerations for tax administrations undertaking tax gap estimation, outlined the approaches used by tax administrations in other countries, and discussed the advantages and limitations of tax gap estimation.
    • The second report was prepared by the Department of Finance and examined the tax gap for Canada’s Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST). It estimated that on average, between 2000 and 2014, 5.6% of potential GST/HST revenues were foregone due to non-compliance.
  • Building on these previous reports, this paper reviews the personal income tax system and provides an in-depth analysis of the level of compliance with Canada’s federal personal income tax laws using the concepts of tax assured and tax gap. Tax assured is a concept developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which identifies portions of the tax base where the tax administrator has assurance of a low risk of non-compliance. The tax gap indicators presented in this report include the tax gap related to the non-payment of personal income taxes, and the gap resulting from unreported income earned in the domestic underground economy (UE).
  • In reviewing the key systemic features of the personal income tax system, this paper finds that extensive third-party information reporting in combination with other features contribute to a tax base that is largely assured or at low risk of non-compliance with minimal direct CRA intervention. For the 2014 tax year, the report finds that 86% of income assessed, 74% of deductions reported and 83% of credits claimed were assured.
  • These findings support CRA’s risk-based compliance strategy which aims to minimize compliance burden for the vast majority of taxpayers reporting correctly while dedicating valuable resources to high-risk areas.
  • Using tax gap analysis, this report then estimates: 1) assessed taxes not collected by the CRA at about $2.2 billion for the 2014 tax year; and, 2) the contribution of domestic unreported income earned in certain key UE activities to federal tax loss at about $6.5 billion in the 2014 tax year. Combined, these tax gaps amount to $8.7 billion or 6.4% of personal income tax revenues in 2014.
  • Of note, self-employment income is a completely non-assured income base, due to a near-complete lack of third-party reporting and a more complex reporting process. As well, the analysis in this paper suggests that self-employed individuals may contribute disproportionately to tax loss resulting from UE activity. While this does not mean that all self-employment income is reported inaccurately, it is at higher risk of reporting non-compliance, be it unintentional or intentional. Such findings have helped inform CRA outreach and the design of compliance efforts in this area of higher compliance risk.
  • This report does not estimate the international component of the tax gap. The CRA is carefully studying the matter and is committed to producing a study on this issue in 2018.

Introduction

An effective personal income tax system depends on taxpayers reporting and paying the right amount of tax at the right time. While a significant majority of Canadians do meet this standard, some do not. Whether intentional or not, this non-compliant behaviour can lead to a tax gap.

The tax gap represents the difference between the taxes that would be paid if all obligations were fully met in all instances, and the tax actually paid and collected. As a tool, tax gap estimates, combined with other data on non-compliant behaviour, can provide tax administrations and governments with valuable insights into the general health of the tax system and the levels of non-compliance with tax laws.

Building on the research presented in previous reports, this paper will review the key characteristics of the personal income tax system and provide an in-depth analysis of the level of compliance with Canada’s federal personal income tax laws using the concepts of tax assured and tax gap.

As discussed in the conceptual tax gap paper published in June 2016, direct tax gaps like income tax gaps are best measured using bottom‐up methodologies that rely on a tax administrator’s internal administrative data to estimate the amount of taxes theoretically owing. A statistically representative sub‐set of taxpayers is used to estimate non-compliance, usually through a random audit program, and the results are then extrapolated to the full taxpayer population to produce a tax gap estimate.

While the CRA does have a random audit program to estimate non-compliance for small- and medium-sized businesses (both self-employed individuals and incorporated businesses), the CRA’s compliance strategy for personal income taxes does not include a comprehensive random audit program that covers the remainder of the individual population. Instead, the CRA applies a risk-based approach to compliance efforts, audits and review processes, and dedicates resources to targeted audits where the risk of non-compliance is greater. This approach helps to minimize the compliance burden on taxpayers, while ensuring a high degree of compliance.

In light of the above, this paper takes the following complementary approaches to analyzing personal income tax non-compliance. It first uses a tax assured framework to identify the portions of the assessed tax base that are at low risk of non-compliance. The tax assur
