Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Pros and Cons of Net Neutrality in 2020: What Side Are You On?
Pros and Cons of Net Neutrality in 2020: What Side Are You On?

Two years ago, the FCC lifted net neutrality. Many providers continue to debate the need for this principle. It has its advantages and disadvantages, but nobody knows whether neutrality will be restored.

What is net neutrality?

Net neutrality is one of the principles of using the Internet. When it works, providers cannot single out any site, giving it more privileges in the form of access speed and so on. All traffic is processed at the same rate. But not everyone liked this idea, so the neutrality was canceled over time. Now, if you don’t want to lose speed while browsing the Internet, it is enough to use VPN for iOS.

3 Pros of Net Neutrality?

Net neutrality has its advantages and disadvantages. Let’s look what is net neutrality and the main advantages of this principle that help users and site creators interact with each other for free.

Freedom of speech 

Without net neutrality, service providers can block content or sites for themselves. In this case, Internet pages with policy that contradicts the point of view of the provider get sanctions. The existence of neutrality allowed all sites to offer customers various content without restrictions, while maintaining freedom of speech.

Now providers look at all content and filter it based on their own wishes.

Previously, websites were rarely blocked. There were some reported cases – blocking of voice messaging and an online payment service. In 2014, President Barack Obama said there was no point in blocking legal content. Users will be able to study and receive the information they want. Broadband Internet access is the first step towards free speech and the promotion of a free community.

Protection of consumer rights 

Existence of net neutrality pros and cons means that providers cannot change the speed of access to some sites or the cost of the selected content for themselves. If providers are able to speed up the work of sites and raise prices for services because of this, consumers will have to spend more money on paying for the Internet. This is a clear disadvantage. Let’s say a user needs to pay separately to use Netflix or Amazon, but alternative sites with slightly lower speeds will be available for free. What does this mean? Clients will give up fast, but expensive resources in favor of slower, but free ones. And if there is net neutrality, then all sites will be available at the same speed.

Increasing the level of competition 

What are the benefits of net neutrality?
With net neutrality, all companies will have the same conditions for the promotion. Now that neutrality has been lifted, Internet organizations are facing various kinds of problems. So, we should note net neutrality benefits and discrimination from providers – most of the content becomes paid, the speed of some resources is becoming lower illegally. Internet service providers can reduce the quality of use of sites that they don’t like.

When neutrality was canceled, providers were able to charge fees for content independently for at least regular communication with their customers. This also applies to startups. The Internet economy will suffer, startups will not be able to develop, because this requires an open and accessible worldwide network.

3 Cons of Net Neutrality?

There are also drawbacks in net neutrality. For these reasons, the management decided to abolish the idea of equality of all resources.

Lack of rules contributes to the development of Internet

Is net neutrality good or bad? Many people believe that if there are no regulated rules, large companies can reach great heights. Such organizations as Google, Facebook and YouTube are examples of this. They started out without net neutrality and gained unprecedented popularity among netizens. With the introduction of neutrality, companies continued to develop. But when the principle was canceled, there was a significant surge of innovation, funds were invested and new content, new ideas appeared.

As economist John Mayo was able to point out, net neutrality prevents Internet companies from growing economically. Providers can’t charge money, organizations don’t receive investment and don’t invest sufficient funds in their development. The Internet and Television Association stands for an open internet. They don’t seek to block or restrict user access to the network, hinder activity, or demand additional funds for viewing certain content when net neutrality has been lifted.

Internet governance has become more difficult 

Net neutrality implies adherence to strict requirements for Internet governance. In 1996, a law on telecommunications was signed, according to which computer and Internet services were provided to citizens without special regulation from the state. The market was free to compete, and new companies could offer their services with ease.

In 2017, it became clear that with neutrality, providers are forced to adhere to the rules and send reports as proof of compliance. CenturyLink spent about 5000 hours annually on paperwork related to the need to meet the requirements of net neutrality. It cost a lot of money. Federal services are losing their powers as net neutrality rules are too complex. Providers cannot raise fees or manage content, and there is no provision in the communications law to regulate such changes.

Consumers are obliged to pay more 

With net neutrality, investment in online services is reduced a lot. Pros and cons to Internet censorship are as follows – the expenses of potential consumers increase. During discussions on neutrality rules, the Federal Commission noted that provider investments would be cut by up to 30%. In monetary terms, this is equivalent to $200 billion. While net neutrality rules were working, investment fell significantly. Service provision could be slowed down, especially in rural and other areas where the need for stable Internet access is the highest.

Neutrality rules prevented providers from demanding payments from large companies for the large bandwidth they used. Site-specific priority promotion fees have been reduced. This led to the disadvantages of net neutrality and increased costs of creating additional resources so that high-quality content is transmitted to providers. The consequence of this is an increase in the cost of paying for tariff plans for using the Internet public Wi-Fi is not an option, here is why. It doesn’t matter whether the user opens expensive services or not.

Takeaway

Each consumer can choose their position for or against net neutrality for themselves. But the federal services will take care of net neutrality at the legislative level. There is nothing wrong with sharing content and raising fees for specific sites for providers and business owners, but not for potential customers. It is easier for a user of Internet services to pay once and use the Internet without restrictions. The only question remains in the final cost of such services.

There are times when providers block access to a resource to users from a certain region. This means that if your place of residence does not match the permitted location, you will be prohibited from viewing the content. Consumers will have to pay to study the necessary information or use a virtual private network to change their IP address. You can check our article about how to unblock websites with VPN.
