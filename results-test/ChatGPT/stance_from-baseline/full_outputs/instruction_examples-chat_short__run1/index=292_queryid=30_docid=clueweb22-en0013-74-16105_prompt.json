Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Indiana Concealed Carry Gun Laws

Indiana is a shall-issue state, but a permit is not required to purchase a handgun.

Indiana State Police have issued over 870,000 concealed carry permits in the state. Indiana’s minimum age to conceal carry is 18, and 32 states have reciprocity with Indiana.

INDIANA CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT RULES

INDIANA CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT

Indiana gun laws require that all persons that conceal carry obtain a permit from Indiana State Police. A person must meet the following requirements to obtain a permit:

  • 18 years of age
  • “Purpose to carry”
  • US citizen; non-US citizen allowed to carry under federal law
  • “Proper person”

Purpose to carry can mean defending oneself, and a proper person is someone that has not:

  • Resisted law enforcement in the last 5 years
  • Been convicted of domestic violence
  • Been convicted of a crime that could lead to a year or longer prison sentence
  • Been found to have a record of drug or alcohol abuse
  • Involuntarily been committed to a mental institution
  • Been found mentally incompetent
  • Been convicted of a felony
  • Had their license to carry suspended

All applicants must meet federal law requirements to carry a firearm. Indiana is enacting HB-1284, which goes into effect on July 1, 2019 and will allow for applicants to pay $10 for a 4-year license, or $40 – $50 for a lifetime license.

Processing time will take 60 days.

Applications can be submitted online.

The application process starts with your form submission and requires two additional steps which must be completed within 90 days of applying:

  1. Schedule to have your fingerprints submitted to your local law enforcement agency
  2. Complete local law enforcement agency processing

There’s an online portal where you can sign in and follow your application status. You can use this portal when obtaining a new license or renewing a license.

You have a 90-day window wherein you must visit your local law enforcement agency. You’ll need to bring your:

  • Payment
  • Handgun License Application Number

You will need to wait for an approval or denial via U.S. mail. You have a right to appeal if you’ve been rejected.

Handgun Training

Indiana is one of the few states where you can apply for a concealed carry license without needing to complete firearms training. It’s still recommended that you complete firearms training on your own to better be able to protect yourself.

Non-resident Concealed Carry Permits in Indiana

Non-residents in the state can obtain what’s called a personal-protection firearm license. The license is valid for 4 years, and you will need to go to the local sheriff’s office to obtain your license.

You must meet all of the licensing requirements above as well as:

  • Provide proof of employment
  • Supply a notarized out-of-state affidavit form
  • You must also have employment or a regular place of business in the state to quality.

HOW LONG ARE CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS VALID FOR IN INDIANA?

Indiana offers the option to pay for a lifetime license, but the license rules, which go into effect in July 2019, allow for licenses to be valid for only 5 years. You will not have to pay any additional fees upon renewal if you’ve paid for the lifetime license.

HOW TO RENEW YOUR CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT IN Indiana

Indiana does require permit renewals, and you can start the renewal process online using the official website. You will need to:

  • Complete a Handgun License Application
  • Schedule an appointment to submit your fingerprints
  • Complete agency processing

Fees will be $10, or you can pay the lifetime fee.

HOW TO CHANGE YOUR NAME OR ADDRESS IF YOU HAVE A PERMIT

Indiana gun laws make changing your name or address a breeze. There’s an online change name / address portal where you can update all of your information.

UNDERSTANDING HOW INDIANA HANDLES HANDGUN PURCHASES

Indiana gun laws do not require you to have a license to own a gun. You also do not have to register your shotgun, rifle or handgun in the state. Firearms can be legally purchased by most residents, but if a resident is found to be a “serious violent felon,” he or she may not purchase a handgun.

Serious felons include a person that has been convicted of:

  • Kidnapping
  • Rape
  • Robbery
  • Manslaughter
  • Murder

The age to purchase a handgun is 18, but a person may be barred from purchasing a handgun until they’re the age of 23 if they have been adjudicated as a minor for an offense that would be considered a felony if the person were an adult.

You can also legally carry in your vehicle.

Is Indiana an open carry state? Yes, with a license to carry. Otherwise, you’re not allowed to carry without a license.

Keep in mind that the gun laws in Indiana do not mention “No Weapon” signage. What this means is that there are no legal penalties for carrying within an area that no weapon signage is present unless it’s listed in the law.

But it’s not recommended to conceal carry in an establishment or area where no weapon signs are present. The owner of the property can ask you to leave, and there are laws that can be broken when you refuse to leave.
