Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Text: EX-10 2 insidertradingpolicylwbclean.htm INSIDER TRADING POLICY INSIDER TRADING POLICY

Exhibit A


INSIDER TRADING POLICY


1.

General Purpose


Federal securities laws prohibit the purchase or sale of securities by persons who are aware of material nonpublic information about a company, as well as the disclosure of material, nonpublic information about a company to others who then trade in the company’s securities. These transactions are commonly known as “insider trading.”


Insider trading violations are heavily pursued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney Offices and are punished.  While the regulatory authorities concentrate their efforts on individuals who trade, or who provide inside information to others who trade, the Federal securities laws also impose potential liability on companies and other “controlling persons” if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel.


The Board of Directors of Oak Ridge Energy Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation, has adopted this Insider Trading Policy (the “Policy”) both to satisfy Oak Ridge’s obligation to prevent insider trading and to help Oak Ridge personnel avoid the consequences associated with violations of the insider trading laws.  For purposes of this policy, the “Company” includes both Oak Ridge Energy Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as Oak Ridge, we or us).


This Policy is also intended to prevent even the appearance of improper conduct on the part of anyone employed by or associated with Oak Ridge, not just so-called “insiders.”  Everyone within Oak Ridge has worked very hard over the last decade to establish Oak Ridge as a company known for integrity and ethical conduct, and Oak Ridge cannot afford to have that reputation damaged.


A copy of this Policy is to be delivered to all current and new employees and consultants upon the commencement of their relationships with Oak Ridge.


2.

Persons Covered


This Policy refers to an “insider” and we wish to define it herein.  Insiders of Oak Ridge are defined as (a) members of our Board of Directors, corporate officers and employees; (b) consultants to Oak Ridge or other persons associated with Oak Ridge and/or its subsidiaries, including distributors, sales agents or other partners that may, in the course of their work with Oak Ridge, receive access to confidential, material non-public information; and (c) household and immediate family members of those listed in (a) and (b) above.





3.

Definitions


A)

Material non-public information:  Material non-public information is defined to be information that is not known to persons outside the immediate company that could be relied upon or considered significant to an investor making a decision to buy or sell Oak Ridge securities.  It is currently very difficult to define each and every category under this heading.  However, any information that should be considered sensitive and non-public material includes but is not limited to the following:


i)

Financial results;

ii)

Future Earnings or Losses;

iii)

News of a pending or proposed sale, merger or acquisition;

iv)

Acquisitions, Mergers or Divestitures;

v)

Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems;

vi)

Major changes in senior management;

vii)

Stock dividends or splits;

viii)

New equity or debt offerings;

ix)

Large contracts in a pending status or in discussion.


Remember, anyone who is reviewing your securities transactions will be doing so after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight.  As such, before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully consider how the others might view the transaction.


B)

Black-Out Periods:  A “Black-Out Period” is a time before and after a significant event wherein an insider may not buy or sell Oak Ridge securities without violating this Policy.  


There are four Black-Out Periods for insiders of Oak Ridge.  These include twenty (20) days prior to the release of financial results for the periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year and end after three full trading days of Oak Ridge securities on the OTCBB (or any other recognized nation medium of which Oak Ridge securities publicly trade [“Other Medium”]) after the results are announced for the preceding fiscal period.  If the last day of the month falls on a weekend, the Black-Out Period will start at the close of business on the last trading day prior to the weekend.


Additional Black-Out Periods may occur when other material events occur, such as a press release sent out to the public, wherein only a select few persons have knowledge of the event.  If you are one of these individuals, or if it would appear to an outsider that you were likely to have had access to such information related to the event, then you will not be allowed to purchase or sell Oak Ridge securities so long as the event remains non-public information and for three full trading days of Oak Ridge securities on the OTCBB or Other Medium after the event is made public.


Also, Oak Ridge may occasionally issue interim earnings guidance or other potentially material information by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 8-K or by other means designed to achieve widespread dissemination of the information.  You should anticipate that trades are unlikely to be pre-cleared while Oak Ridge is in the process of



2




assembling the information to be released and until the information has been released and fully absorbed by the public market.  The existence of an additional Black-Out Period will not be announced.  If you request pre-clearance of a transaction in Oak Ridge’s securities during an additional Black-Out Period, you will be informed of the existence of a Black-Out Period, but you may not be advised of the reason for the Black-Out.


If you are made aware of the existence of an additional Black-Out Period, you should not disclose the existence of the Black-Out Period to any other person.  Whether or not you are designated as being subject to an additional Black-Out Period, you still have the obligation not to purchase or sell Oak Ridge securities while you are aware of the material non-public information.


C)

Securities:  Securities of Oak Ridge are defined as common stock, preferred stock, options to purchase stock, warrants, convertible debt and/or derivative securities.


These Black-Out Periods do not apply to the exercise of Stock Option Agreements for Rule 144 common stock of Oak Ridge that are issued by Oak Ridge or other stock issuances approved by the Board of Directors.
