con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Abstract

Obesity must be considered a real pathology. In the world wide, obesity represent one of the major public health issue associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Overweight or obesity, in fact, significantly increases the risk of contracting diseases, such as: arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebral vasculopathy, gallbladder lithiasis, arthropathy, ovarian polycytosis, sleep apnea syndrome, and some neoplasms. Despite numerous informative campaigns, unfortunately, the fight against obesity does not seem to work: in the last years, the prevalence continued to increase. The progressive and rapid increase in the incidence of obesity, which has characterized most of the economically advanced countries in the last decade, has been the main stimulus for the research of the mechanisms underlying this pathology and the related disorders. The aims of this review is to provide a revision of the literature in order to define obesity as diseases, secondly to highlight the limits and the inaccuracy of common tools used for the diagnosis of obesity, and as a third thing to strengthen the concept of the complexity of obesity as a disease among political health care providers. Obesity may be viewed as a multifactorial pathology and chronic low-grade inflammatory disease. In fact, people affected by obesity have greater risk of developing comorbility and morbility, respect to healthy. Hence, the absolute therapeutic benefit is directly proportional to the basic risk. So, internationally interest on early diagnosis of obesity is growing to avoid under- and overdiagnosis consequences. Therefore, the consequences are an aggravation of the disease and an increase in obesity related pathology like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The most widely used parameter for diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) is not suitable for assessing the body fat. In fact, several studies demonstrate that BMI alone cannot define obesity, which consists not so much in weight gain as in excess fat mass. The use of suitable tools for the assessment of fat mass percentage combined with clinical and genetic analysis allowed to identify different phenotypes of obesity, which explain the various paradoxes of obesity. It is essential to adopt all possible strategies to be able to combat obesity, ameliorate the suffering of patients, and reduce the social and treatment costs of obesity.

Background

World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”, with the fundamental aim to expand the conceptual framework of nations health systems. However, despite the efforts to improve or preserve health, chronic degenerative diseases have increased [].

It therefore seems essential to define not only the state of health, but also of illness, in order to identify those indicators useful for promoting structural and environmental changes.

Diseases, that produce specific symptoms or affect a specific location, are defined as “deviations from the normal or healthy structure or function of a part, organ, or system of the body, caused by underlying etiologies, manifested by characteristic symptoms and signs, and resulting in pathologic consequences that affect health, feeling, or functioning” [, ].

The main requirement of defining the disease is its ability to accurately predict clinically relevant outcomes. It is important to underline that unclear definitions of illness result in inconsistent diagnoses and are of poor clinical utility.

In order to define a disease with certainty, it is necessary to know: the effects on incidence and prevalence of the disease itself; the changes to the natural history of the disease; the efficacy of the treatment; the benefits under conditions where the new definition will be used to determine the treatment threshold; the adverse effects including the psychological and economic ones; the usefulness of the definition of the disease on an individual and social level []. The possibility of not achieving all the listed requirements leads to a necessity of new definition [].

The risk of an extension of the definitions of illness could be the inclusion of other pathologies, at different stages, already recognized.

In this case, both over- or underdiagnosis and a diagnostic error can led to no certainty of treatment efficacy. Due to this internationally interest on correct and early diagnosis is growing [].

The critical point seems to lie in the lack of shared criteria for the definition of the disease and in the difficulty of the current ways of identifying and prevent any inappropriate changes [].

However, from the point of view of a predictive and preventive medicine [], the question that must be asked goes towards another direction. One has to wonder how the misdiagnosis or failure to early diagnosis of disease, such as obesity, aggravates the consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality and in health care costs, where correct diagnostic tools are available and personalized care is possible. A patient will benefit from the diagnosis of a disease only if it allows the understanding of symptoms or the risk of clinically relevant events, or if the patient can benefit from a specific treatment. In particular, the obesity problem seems to be the underdiagnosis rather than the overdiagnosis. In fact, about 30% of the people with obesity does not have a diagnosis because of the limit to evaluate the body fat content [].

The aims of this review is to provide a revision of the literature in order to define obesity as diseases, secondly to highlight the limits and the inaccuracy of common tools used for the diagnosis of obesity, and as a third thing to strengthen the concept of the complexity of obesity as a disease among political health care providers.

Obesity as disease and increased comorbidity risk

Obesity is a real epidemic and a public health problem, defined by The Obesity Society (TOS) as a disease [], and not only an underpinning of major chronic diseases, but a serious debilitating condition in its own right [].

Obesity is a multifactorial pathology that can be related to an altered nutritional behavior or secondary to genetic, hypothalamic, iatrogenic or endocrine diseases [].

At the base of obesity is adiposopathy (or “sick fat”) defined as “pathologic adipose tissue anatomic/functional disturbances promoted by positive caloric balance in genetically and environmentally susceptible individuals that result in adverse endocrine and immune responses that may cause or worsen metabolic disease” [].

Adiposopathy is sustained by adipocyte hypertrophy, visceral adiposity and ⁄or ectopic fat deposition and secretion of hormones, like leptin, and proinflammatory protein, like the plethora of cytokines, that in turn may lead to metabolic disease [].

Therefore, we can classified obesity as a primary disease since the adiposopathy determines the dysregulation of the metabolic pathways []. Metabolic diseases most associated with primary obesity contribute to atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes type II, hyperandrogenemia in women and hypoandrogenemia/hyperestrogenemia in men [].

There may be pathogenic immune and adiposopathic endocrine responses for the cardiovascular system or other systems. Sometimes, adiposopathy may cause atherosclerotic risk factors such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia [].

The diagnosis and treatment of obesity plays, therefore, an important role since this pathology is associated with an increased risk of numerous diseases and reduced life expectancy.

Pre-obesity or obesity significantly increases the risk of contracting and favoring the development of more than 200 chronic diseases [], including but not limited to the following: type 2 diabetes mellitus (the risk of suffering from diabetes mellitus is 2.9 times higher in subjects with obesity, and the prevalence of diabetes is ten times greater in subjects with moderate obesity and thirty times in cases of excess of 135% of body weight compared to the ideal weight); cardiovascular diseases (CVD); hypertension (three-fold increase in risk of being affected by hypertension); dyslipidemia; coronary heart disease; gallbladder stones (three-fold increase in risk of being affected by gallbladder stones); obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; asthma; psychiatric diseases, including depression; polycystic ovary syndrome; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; gastrointestinal reflux disease; osteoarthritis; some cancers. Among the most common tumors, obesity increases the risk of postmenopausal breast, endometrial, prostate, colorectal cancer and adenocarcinoma [, ]. Several studies on children have shown that there has been an increased risk of diabetes, CVD, cancer, PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome [].
