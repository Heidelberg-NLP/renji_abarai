Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

It won't be anyday. If privatized, who will run branches in the remotest and difficult areas of the country where one has to walk on roads for hours to reach the branch?

Who will give loan to farmers, the poor and needy ?

Who will open Jan Dhan & other no frills account.

Who will construct toilets in schools?

Who will open adhar ?

Whi will handle confidential foreign/defence transaction of the country?

So, it won't be privatized.

If SBI gets privatised you should stop looking for job in banking sector it self. Or let's say you will be lucky to have a job in any sector even if that pays you less than what you need to support your family.

The reason I am saying it because. If SBI becomes private it means the Indian economy have collapsed beyond the point of return.

There are no jobs available and the inflation is way too high for government to control. Resulting in the increase in cost of living similar to Venezuela (1VEF =7.0932 INR and 1kg chicken costs 14 million VEF).

The hyperinflation will consume the country.

So, in short SBI is not going to be privatised.. And if it does, do not leave your job…. As its employee facilities won't change even if it did…and having a job itself will be a big thing iff they don't fire you due to lack of funds.

Hope this was enough to answer your question.

Hiring the wrong financial advisor can wreak havoc on your retirement. This tool is changing everything.

Nothing will happen .The very same people will do the same .By privatising people are not changed .It is the attitude that must change .All private sector companies are not top performing .Majority of private sector companies are bad in service ,85 % of listed companies are making loss .Productivity and service in Indian private sector is equally bad .What we have to do is improving productivity and service whether private or govt .

SBI cannot be privatised at any cost, atleast for the next 10–15 years because thats the main bank which handles a significant share of govt business. It is the largest money lender of the country and will continue to be at the top.

Now, answering your question, in case if it is privatised, that means no job security, more targets, more layoffs, pure corporate culture.

Thanks!

If SBI is privatized, then it has the capacity to provide world class services as being sought by most of the customers. It will exercise its power to run profitable branches and close the branches which are loss making and only being run to support social cause.

It then will of course charge accordingly and i understand will be accepted by most. The lower strata of our society will have to move to some other PSU to run thier zero balance accounts.

SBI presently holds 70%of the Jan Dhan Accounts of the poor people. It will no more be required to so any further in that field.

Further, they will no

Further, they will not have influence over sanctions of high value from the Govt thus improving asset quality.

But the question remains, if not SBI then who has the capacity and infrastructure for replacing services to the society.

The best person to answer, a licensed vet. Sign up quickly and connect with a vet in less than a minute.

If SBI will be privatized, it can be 3 times bigger than ALL private sector banks. Means, today SBI is valued at around 215000 crores. And if it is privatized, it will be 3000000crores. The figure looks huge. But it is possible. If hdfc bank can be valued at 500000 crores, why SBI cant be valued at 3000000 crores given that rural network of SBI is very strong.

It's a govt's primary bank and therefore cannot be privatized.

First thing, privatization has nothing to do with bank job.

It is a hectic job because it involves public dealing. Abuses and arguments become part of your life. No respect in society even though bankers are working from day 1 of lockdown. Unions are totally useless. They can't even fight for our rights. Less salary. Pressure from govt for new schemes. After all this, govt wants to privatise banks because they can't increase salaries or recruit new people which can give more tax so they want to sell whatever asset this country has.

But is there any other job? Not at all. 2017 SSC selected studen

But is there any other job? Not at all. 2017 SSC selected students waiting for joining. 2018 2019 is still going. No information about railways NTPC exam. State PCS can't even release notification on time. This is the only reason people opt for banking. No other industry can recruit 50–60k people every year. Corona has worsened the private sector jobs too.

When I visit the branch of the XYZ (a Private) bank, I feel like a King. Such an amazing customer service they have. The case for privatization is really a strong one. All banks should be made private,” said a friend of mine who earns a decent salary these days.

So I asked him, “Well, have you visited a Zara outlet?

“No, I haven’t,” he said.

Well, when I walk into their store, I feel like heaven. Such an amazing quality of products and they give damn awesome service. I don’t think any other brand or these local shopkeepers should be selling apparel. Only Zara should be there. And a few other s

Well, when I walk into their store, I feel like heaven. Such an amazing quality of products and they give damn awesome service. I don’t think any other brand or these local shopkeepers should be selling apparel. Only Zara should be there. And a few other selected comparable brands,” I said.

He replied,” Well you must be kidding. Only a few people can afford Zara here. And the only Zara outlet nearby is 300 km away from us. You should come back to reality.”

To be honest, so should you. I know that the customer service you are getting is beyond expectations, but it comes for a price. And not everyone in this country can afford such a service. Further, you are salaried, working in an urban center, and have access to the physical branch easily. But don’t forget that more than half of India resides in villages where it’s not feasible for your favorite bank to provide a branch. Not to forget that many rural people are still yet to have an internet connection, so a branch is everything for them. Also, you are earning well, and can meet the requirements (whether monetary or documentary) which your bank wants, but it is probably not going to give a No Frills Account or a BSBD Account to everyone. Public Sector Banks are here for a cause. We have and we had issues, but no organization in this country is perfect.

Now the message in this post is a debatable one. Not from a political angle, but from an economic angle too. But we need to understand that India is still a low-income country. It is not a country of elites, but of those many poor people who want to come out of poverty. Access to banking and insurance is also amongst the factors that can raise their standard of living. And PSBs have been working big time towards achieving this goal. Let’s not forget the ATMs they installed at secluded places, the branches they opened in unbanked areas, the PMSvanidhis and MUDRA Loans that they disbursed, the Jan Dhan accounts they opened and the Demonetization they handled. (Meanwhile, I also don’t want to eliminate their operational inefficiencies and the big-ticket bad loans they have). But, they don’t post a loss every quarter. Many PSBs have an operating profit. It’s just that they are here to serve a different motive that is not all about making a profit. Our country still needs them. And rather than privatizing them, we need to introduce a lot of operational changes so that they can strive.


I hope I answered your question properly.
