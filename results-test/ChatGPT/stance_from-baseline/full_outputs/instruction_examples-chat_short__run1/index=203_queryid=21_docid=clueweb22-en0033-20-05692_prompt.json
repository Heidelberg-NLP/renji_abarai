Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

HUMAN ACTIVITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE

WILLIAM WRIGHT
GRANTHAM UNIVERSITY

In this paper I will discuss Human Activity and Climate Change. I will discuss different human activities that might affect climate change, things such as the burning of fossil fuels and how they might contribute to climate change. To begin I will discuss what the definition of climate change. Climate change is the change in the atmosphere by the amounts of carbon dioxide levels that come from using fossil fuels. Climate change can occur when the Earth’s atmosphere become warmer than what it naturally should be. Affects that can happen from climate change is extreme weather change which can cause flooding in areas that it has not flooded before as well as drought and glaciers to melt as well as cause the environment to change. A lot of climate change is directly due to human activity; one of the activities that humans have done is released large amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which is a greenhouse gas that comes from burning fossil fuels. Greenhouse gases have wrapped around the earth’s surface like an extra blanket causing the Earth to heat up much more and affecting the balance of nature. Greenhouse gases are not only limited to large factories but also the amount of vehicles on the road; cars produce carbon dioxide as well. History has shown that the choices that we make can affect us on a large scale to include changing our environment as well as our climate.
