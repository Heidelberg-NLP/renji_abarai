pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Due to the fact that I have become convinced that errors have been made in its application and the fact that it costs more to execute someone in the United States than it does to simply lock them up and throw away the key, I am OK with the abolition of capital punishment as long as the option of life in prison with no possibility of parole (LWOP) is available as a sentencing option. There are some individuals who are simply beyond any reasonable prospect of rehabilitation, or whose crimes are so heinous that they are beyond redemption, and such persons should never be allowed outside of a pris

There are some individuals who are simply beyond any reasonable prospect of rehabilitation, or whose crimes are so heinous that they are beyond redemption, and such persons should never be allowed outside of a prison, even if we spare their lives.

I have said before that I expect that I will see the end of capital punishment in the United States during my lifetime. The election of Donald Trump as President probably gave it a new lease on life (a weird thing to say about the death penalty, LOL), but it’s still something that is in decline nationwide. Even in Texas, the trend is massively down since a peak of 40 executions in 2000; in 2016 and 2017, the state executed just seven people each year, and the population on death row has dropped from 459 to 235.

In 2004 Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in Texas for the arson and murder of his family. Texas Governor Rick Perry was very proud of that execution. Sadly, Willingham was innocent. An oversight committee was formed to investigate the killing of Willingham but right before they were to release their results, Perry fired them and squashed their report.

How do you apologize to a man you’ve executed in error?

Meanwhile, Alabama refuses to allow a DNA test on a death row prisoner that might have exonerated him. He’s dead now. The test could have proven he was not guilty. Or maybe he was. We’ll n

How do you apologize to a man you’ve executed in error?

Meanwhile, Alabama refuses to allow a DNA test on a death row prisoner that might have exonerated him. He’s dead now. The test could have proven he was not guilty. Or maybe he was. We’ll never know. But Alabama and Texas aren’t interested in guilt or innocence. They’re interested in executions. Probably “pour décourager les autres”. Only it doesn’t work. Murders always go up in the wake of executions. No one knows why for sure. Think about this for a minute: why would a justice system EVER pass up a chance to prove a man behind bars is innocent? If he is, the bigger problem is that the KILLER IS STILL ON THE LOOSE. But Alabama and Texas and places that refuse any mechanism that might disprove guilt aren’t interested in finding the real killer. Their attitude shows they are only interested in killing people, mostly Black people.

That’s another reason the death penalty is wrong - unfair application by a systemically racist and sexist justice system. Why are Blacks disproportionately executed for the same crimes? Why aren’t women executed proportionally for the same crimes? The inability to apply the penalty in a fair manner shows how flawed it is. The inability to accept every mechanism that MIGHT prove the prisoner is innocent shows the State is only interested in execution, not guilt or innocence. The desperate and underhanded means that States go through to acquire chemicals that kill further underscores their bloodlust.

In addition, the number of botched executions is sickening. All you need do is look at the execution of Clayton Lockett who was stuck with needles and chemicals that caused violent seizures and great pain for such a long time that the screen had to be closed between the prisoner and the witnesses because it was too gruesome to watch. Not only did he survive, but they decided to try again two weeks later and finally tortured him to death. So not only are we deciding to execute people, we’re deciding to torture them as well. And somehow this is acceptable? The funny thing is that there is a very large minority of botched executions and during many of them the prisoner is EXPECTED to assist the executioners. That’s asking too much. Is that who we are as a people? That we execute the innocent or the race or sex we don’t particularly like, torture them to death, and then expect them to assist in their own execution?

The death penalty is always wrong. Don’t care how sure you think you are, the times you make a mistake make it not worthwhile for the times you are right.

Edit:

Based on the comments I had to make changes because some right wingers say I actually foment crime because I believe the death penalty is wrong. It’s funny how many of these same people think that gun laws won’t deter gun crimes but death penalty laws will deter capital crimes. The hypocrisy is outstanding.

Life and death are in the hands on almighty/universe and I think it should be. Taking life of someone who has done something very bad is not a punishment but a vengeance. What i believe is no matter how evil an act is, the person who did it was driven by something that was not in his control.
A study shows that 99 percent of the people who does these things have a badly connected brain, caused by an evil childhood or by simple lack of normal human capacities.
This punishment can never be taken back.

Unlike robots we humans are capable of developing emotions like regret and should be allowed every chance to do so before they die.
I'm not saying I'm in the favor of things the person at fault have done. I'm just saying that they should be given a chance to improve what they have done. They must realize their mistake. No study has shown that
the death penalty deters murder more than life imprisonment.
There's a very famous saying that '
Life can only be seen to be protected if those who take it away are proportionately punished'
Instead of hanging them they should be taught what life is and likewise should be punished for that. We all have committed mistakes in our childhood but instead of doing violence to us, our parents have given us a proper lesson why we shouldn't do it. Likewise we should maintain a balance of punishment and lesson among these culprits.
Moreover our government should take more measures to educate people and families should maintain proper decent surroundings. No one is bad since birth, surroundings and situations have made them like this. So we should all work on that.
If an actual change is made regarding this, it'll only bring a fruitful response in our society. People will understand each other's emotion after getting a proper chance to improve.
At the same time, children's should be taught about right or wrong from the beginning in high-school as well as at home. So that it brings a sensible and an effective change in upcoming generation.

I hope I made my point clear! These are my views if I made any mistake, I'm eager to learn and improve that too.
Thankyou

No I think that if you are found guilty of a crime and you get the death penalty then you should go from court to death In less than 48hours. That would give criminals something to think about before they committed the crime!!!

No

No I do not believe in the death penalty. The Justice system is too flawed to be sure. I don’t believe in an eye for an eye justice. I believe in reform. I believe in addressing the roots of crime, which for the most part, is due to poverty and lack of education. Look to Cuba, free education leads to low crime.

All 50 states already tried banning murder. How well has that worked?

This is a fascinating question: not just for its content, but as an illustration of cultural differences.

Very few developed countries still have the death penalty.

Most abolished it decades ago, and it is totally uncontroversial

So the fact it is still debated, let alone still used, in USA is striking.

In addition to the logical reasons to scrap it: mistakes ARE made, and a “whoops, sorry” is not much use; it is discriminatory; it does not deter; it is has perverse incentives; etc

But look at this list: China, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the USA

If you are American, would you be proud to defen
