Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

    Abortion has become a popular topic over the years. An abortion is the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy (Daum, 2012). Some people are Pro-abortionist, meaning that they believe it should be legal. Others are Anti-abortionist; they believe it should be illegal. The ongoing debate of whether abortion should remain legal or illegal aroused in the 1970‚Äôs during the Roe vs. Wade case. In 1969, Norma L. Mc Corvey known as Jane Roe discovered she was pregnant with her third child. Abortion was only legal in cases of rape or incest in Texas at the time. For this reason, Roe falsely stated that she was raped in order to obtain a legal abortion. However, this scheme failed due to the lack of evidence and police reports. Jane Roe then filed suit in a U.S District Court in Texas, alleging that the abortion law in Texas violated her constitutional rights and the rights of other women.

    The defendant in the case was Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade. The Supreme Court sided with Roe and in 1973 ‚Äúthe US Supreme Courts declared the procedure of abortion a fundamental right‚Äù (Lewis, 2012), legalizing abortion throughout the US. Jane Roe was able to provide the US Supreme Court with enough reasoning on why abortion should be legal, but does that necessarily means her claim is right? Is abortion murder? Many Pro-abortionist think that abortion is not murder, but in fact ‚ÄúDr. Micheline M. Mathews-Roth, Harvard Medical School, referenced medical textbooks that claimed that human life begins at conception‚Äù (Rose, 2009). Therefore, the fetus or embryo is actually a human. When a woman gets an abortion, it stops the life and growth of a human being, killing them.
