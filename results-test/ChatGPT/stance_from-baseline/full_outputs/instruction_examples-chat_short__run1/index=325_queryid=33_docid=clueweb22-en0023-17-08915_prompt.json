Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should people become vegetarian?
Text: Should all people be vegetarian? | Debate.org
  • Yesssss we should eat only veg

    As we all know we are also evolved animals .Would we like it if someone killed us and than cooked us ,ate us.We will fell pain and so do the animals.They also have feelings.I am also pure vegetarian and i think everyone should also be a vegetarian plus some animal oil can cause us different types of illness and even kill us by giving a heart attack

  • It should be true.

    There is the oil from animals and oil from vegetables but, animal oil could cause a result of diabetes or a heart-attack. Vegetable oils cause no harm and + it i simply cheaper than animal oil. What about other people who are poor, they could simply grow vegetables but not have the weapons to kill animals. There are no animals probably around them

  • It is healthier.

    Well, a lot of people are fat asses. We need to change that. You know why? Because we don't want the Earth to fall out of the unviverse because of all the fat asses in this world.
