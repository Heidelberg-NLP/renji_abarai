Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Pro & Con Quotes: Should Teachers Get Tenure?

General Reference (not clearly pro or con)

Aaron Churchill, MA, Ohio Research Director for the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, in a May 30, 2018 article titled “Analyzing Teacher Tenure Reform in Florida,” available from edexcellence.net, wrote:

“In theory, removing tenure in K–12 education can both positively and negatively affect student achievement. On the one hand, it may increase achievement as teachers are incentivized to focus more intently on student learning, knowing their job is on the line each year. Over the long haul, the overall quality of the educator workforce may improve if incompetent teachers are removed more swiftly and frequently than they are today. On the other hand, school leaders may be prone to poor judgment and erroneously dismiss some effective teachers. Proponents of tenure also suggest that eliminating tenure – a job perk – might dissuade talented individuals from entering the profession, though it may also attract less ambitious people seeking job protections.”

Adam Ross, JD, General Counsel for the United Federation of Teachers at the time of the quote, quoted in a Jan. 4, 2018 article by Linda Ocasio titled “UFT Argues for Dismissal of Tenure Case,” available from uft.org, said:

“Tenure helps ensure that teachers can do their jobs…

It enables teachers to grade honestly, to speak out for their students’ needs, to teach controversial subjects and to blow the whistle on corruption and poor practices. It allows teachers to teach without fear, particularly necessary in today’s politically charged climate.”

Lily Eskelsen Garcia, MEd, President of the National Education Association (NEA), in a Feb. 24, 2016 press release for nea.org titled “NEA Seeks Reversal of Deeply-Flawed Vergara Decision,” wrote:

“Due process policies such as tenure are an important job protection that teachers value highly. These policies don’t prevent bad teachers from being fired; they prevent good teachers from being fired for bad reasons. Qualified teachers earn these due process protections after satisfying performance expectations. These protections allow teachers to advocate for their students and to teach controversial and challenging curriculum without fear that they will be punished for doing so by overreaching administrators and others with arbitrary or personal agendas.

Striking down the statutes will not help our most at-risk students. High-poverty districts do not suffer from too few teachers being removed; they suffer from too much teacher turnover. Attracting and retaining effective teachers to these schools must be the highest priority.”

Jake Miller, MEd, award-winning middle school teacher and columnist, in an article for The Educator’s Room titled “Why I Support Teacher Tenure,” available from theeducatorsroom.com (accessed Dec. 6, 2018), wrote:

“I’m a teacher. I have tenure. This gives me staying power and job security. My job isn’t supposed to be political – it’s supposed to be about teaching student[s]. For that reason, tenure is something I feel that I need in my profession.

Why? As a social studies teacher, I need academic freedom. It’s my job to expose students to a variety of mindsets, viewpoints, and a litany of issues that seem to perturb both the far-left and far-right. I want to open minds, and sometimes I have to fight past closed ones – especially those of parents.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, JD, Dean of the Berkeley School of Law at the University of California, in an Apr. 21, 2016 article for the ocregister.com titled “Misguided Attack on Tenure Sidetracked,” wrote:

“No one disputes that education is unequal in California and the United States. Poorer children and children of color are disadvantaged in the educational system. But the tenure system for teachers is not responsible for this, nor will altering it improve education for those who most need reform…

Every year, the states with the highest student performance are states, like Maryland and Massachusetts, with robust protection of teachers. One of the key reasons they are successful is that these states do a better job at getting resources to the neediest students and creating a climate where teachers have the support needed to succeed and therefore stay in the profession.

The problem of inner-city schools is not that the dedicated teachers who work in them have too many rights, but that the schools have inadequate resources, the students who go to them are disadvantaged in many ways, and the schools are surrounded by communities that are dangerous, lack essential services and are largely segregated both by race and class. Taking away from teachers the modest job security accorded by tenure will address none of these problems.”

Denise Specht, MS, President of Education Minnesota and former teacher, in a Jan. 9, 2017 news release for Education Minnesota titled “Education Minnesota Responds to Latest Attempt to Silence Teachers,” wrote:

“Due process protections [teacher tenure] are earned by Minnesota teachers after they have passed a lengthy probationary period and have met certain performance expectations… These laws don’t prevent bad teachers from getting fired, they prevent good teachers from being fired for bad reasons. Tenure laws protect teachers who speak out about the learning conditions in their schools. They are what assure parents they are getting the real story at conferences, or PTA meetings, or when they read an interview with a teacher in the newspaper. These laws are the teachers’ First Amendment.”

Pedro A. Noguera, PhD, Professor of Education in the Steinhardt Development at New York University, wrote the following in his June 19, 2014 article titled “In Defense of Teacher Tenure,” published in the Wall Street Journal:

“Tenure should never prevent a school district from getting rid of bad teachers. Tenure has never been — nor should it be — a guarantee of a job for life…

Ideally, tenure helps low-income schools to attract — and retain — good teachers… Students in districts with large minority populations are much more likely to be taught by new, inexperienced teachers who have only a bachelor’s degree and are often not certified in the subjects they teach…

Schools in high-poverty communities are also typically underfunded, as revenues from local property taxes tend to be meager. That makes it difficult for low-income schools to find and keep top teachers…

In recent years, tenure has given teachers the job security that allows them to report cheating and call attention to the deplorable conditions in low-income schools…

Blaming teacher tenure for the flaws of L.A.’s troubled school system is like blaming doctors at Veterans Affairs hospitals for the deep flaws in the VA system. Ending tenure will only make it harder to fix the flaws in a vital public institution.”

New York State United Teachers wrote in their Feb. 11, 2011 article “Mythbusters: The Truth About Tenure,” available at www.nysut.org:

“Unions don’t grant tenure – administrators do. Too many school boards and superintendents attack tenure rather than hold their own managers accountable for hiring and supervising teachers and, if necessary, removing those who don’t make the grade. Tenure is granted by the board of education on recommendation of the superintendent –but many schools do a poor job of evaluating and supporting teachers…

Tenure’s not about protecting ‘bad’ teachers; it’s about protecting good teachers. What would happen to teachers without tenure? They could — and would — be fired for virtually any reason.

It’s not hard to imagine teachers being dismissed because they failed the daughter of an influential businessman or because the school board president’s nephew needed a job.

In these fiscally troubled times, what would stop a school board from replacing a veteran teacher at the top of the pay scale with a first-year teacher — simply to save money? Tenure is the first line of defense against attacks on academic freedom. Teachers can engage their students in a free exchange of ideas only if they are protected from arbitrary dismissal for doing so. Tenure prevents school boards from arbitrarily dismissing teachers for holding political, religious or social views with which they disagree.

It protects academic freedom the way the First Amendment protects freedom of the press.”

The California Federation of Teachers stated in a June 10, 2014 press release titled “Teacher Rights Overturned by Court Decision,” available at cft.org:

“Stripping Teachers of their workplace professional rights will harm, not improve students learning.

Anti-public education ‘reformers’ are forever repeating that rules and regulations make it impossible to fire ‘bad teachers.’ Here are the facts. During the first two years of a teacher’s career, a lengthy probation period, administrators can fire them for any reason, or for no reason at all. After that, the requirements are for the administrator to document the problem necessitating the teacher’s dismissal, and convince two out of three people on a panel of experts to agree. That’s it. A teacher’s simple right to a hearing before dismissal is not unfair to students. To the contrary: students need a stable, experienced teaching workforce, not a revolving door of educators…

The [tenure] laws targeted in this case provide due process when a teacher is accused of misconduct or poor performance, and objectivity in times of layoff. These laws benefit the education system as a whole
