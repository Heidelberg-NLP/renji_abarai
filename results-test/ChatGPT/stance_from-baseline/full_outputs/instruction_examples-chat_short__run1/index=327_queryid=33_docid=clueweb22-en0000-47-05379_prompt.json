Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should everyone become vegetarian?

With ethical diets on the increase among young voters, we talk to them about what they eat and why it matters politically

In our “Virgin voters” series, we listen to what young people and first-time voters have to say about the issues that matter most to them. With increasing numbers of students supporting the Green party and environmental causes, we ask young people about their attitude towards meat.

Vegetarian, vegan, flexitarian: what’s going on?

  • Vegetarian diets are gaining in popularity, with 12% of UK adults following a vegetarian or vegan diet, according to research published last year. Millions more are flexitarians, cutting down on meat. Environmental or health concerns are given as reasons.
  • Young people in particular are adapting their diet according to environmental beliefs, with 20% of 16- to 24-year-olds following a vegetarian diet. The Vegetarian Society says: “Young people have increased their awareness of the environmental impact of eating meat from 8% in 2007 to 40% in 2013.”

What the political parties are saying:

  • The Green party supports “a progressive transition from diets dominated by meat and other animal products to healthier diets based on plant foods” and “more sustainable methods of production such as organic and stock-free farming”. It would ensure vegetarian and vegan options are available in schools, hospitals and other public sector establishments.
  • The Conservatives and Labour have no clear policies on vegetarianism, though both support sustainable farming. The Lib Dems also care about sustainability and say they want to improve welfare conditions for animals kept on farms. Ukip wants to ban religious slaughter for halal and kosher meat where animals are killed without being stunned – but a Lib Dem MEP says this is “more about exploiting xenophobia than protecting animals”.

We spoke to young people to find out how important ethical food consumption is to them: what do they eat and do they think politicians should talk more about where our food comes from?

‘Everyone should cut down on meat – western meat-eating levels are unsustainable’

Jess Murray
Jess Murray

Jess Murray, 19, philosophy student at University College London (UCL), is vegan. She says:

Becoming vegan was an ethical decision. I wanted to avoid killing animals just because I wanted – rather than needed – to eat them. I moved from being vegetarian to vegan as I realised that vegetarianism does little in terms of animal rights - people tend to up their dairy intake as vegetarians, and the dairy industry is filled with cruelty. It’s hard to justify the meat and dairy industries as they currently stand, because the animals are treated badly, and unless you have the money, it’s hard to obtain ethically sourced meat. Everyone should cut down on their meat consumption, as current western meat-eating levels are at an unsustainable level.

It’s selfish and unethical for humans to kill animals for food’

Jena Herbert

Jena Herbert, 21, a PGCE student at University College London (UCL), is vegetarian. She says:

I’ve been vegetarian all my life – almost 22 years. Just like us, animals have feelings and suffer considerably due to the meat industry, and it seems to me to be selfish and unethical for humans to continue to kill animals for food when there are so many wonderful alternatives out there now. I’d never say that everyone should eat in the same way as me. I do think, however, that it would be good for our planet if more people thought more carefully about, not only where their food comes from, but also how it ends up on your plate. I believe that many of my friends would cut down on their meat intake if they saw some of the inhumane methods undertaken in slaughterhouses.

‘I’d like more emphasis to be put on the environment in politics’

Frederick Wilson-Haffenden

Frederick Wilson-Hafffenden, 22, Cambridge graduate working for an educational startup, eats meat. He says:

I eat meat because I believe it to be healthy and I enjoy it, but I don’t think you need it with every meal. I probably eat it once a day. Everyone should know where their meat is from – animal welfare is very important, as is humane slaughter. I don’t buy organic meat but always buy free-range meat, and my family eat the meat from our farm.

Having grown up around animals and seen both organic and non-organic produce, I think non-organic gives the animals a more comfortable life. It allows “chemical” medicines to be used in the same way that we use “chemical” medicines on humans, rather than finding a naturally occurring compound to attempt to do the same job. Buying local produce is also important. I’d like more emphasis to be put on the environment in politics.

‘The welfare of animals and the environment is low down on most people’s list of priorities’

Meriel

Meriel, 22, Exeter graduate and project assistant for the Imperial war museum, is flexitarian. She says:

I’ve been a semi-vegetarian since I was 10. I eat fish and poultry, but don’t eat meat from livestock such as lamb, pork or beef. I’m quite strict with it – if I order chicken in a restaurant, I check that the gravy doesn’t use beef-stock, but I won’t have a meltdown if I eat sweets with gelatine in. I often just say I’m vegetarian so I don’t have to ask awkward questions about ingredients. What I eat is now out of habit, rather than principle, and it’s the texture and smell of meat I can’t stand.

People should be aware of where their food comes from, but I think that unfortunately politicians would be wasting their breath promoting it in their campaigns. It could make such a difference to our nation’s health, the welfare of animals, and the welfare of the environment if we ate less meat and only produced as much as is sustainable. Sadly, these things are very low down on most people’s priorities.

‘I don’t care too much about where my meat comes from’

Benjamin Macey
Benjamin Macey

Benjamin Macey, 19, first-year pharmacy student at the University of Bath, eats meat. He says:

I enjoy eating meat because of the taste and I believe it’s essential for a balanced diet. I don’t really have any ethical concerns and don’t care too much about where my meat comes from. I wasn’t bothered by the horse meat scandal either because horse meat can be healthier than beef.

However, I try to buy British and organic where possible to support our farmers. The only environment issues I’d be interested in hearing more about from politicians would be the problems of waste, landfill and the packaging the food comes in.

‘Politicians’ attitudes towards ethical food consumption and the environment considerably affect my vote’

Molly Russell
Molly Russell

Molly Russell, 18, first-year French and English literature student at the University of Warwick, is vegetarian. She says:

I’ve been vegetarian for 10 years and am currently following a vegan diet a couple of days a week. For me, the reasons are purely ethical and environmental. At the age of eight I became interested in environmental issues, animal rights and the harsh reality of factory farming. Eating meat contributes to land and water pollution and the needless suffering of animals. If people considered more deeply where their food came from, they’d think about reducing their meat intake.

I strongly believe these issues should feature more on the political agenda. Politicians’ attitudes towards ethical food consumption and the environment considerably affect my vote, and for this reason I am planning on supporting the Green party in this year’s general election.

‘Not everyone has the time or money to follow a vegetarian diet’

Helena Horton
Helena Horton

Helena Horton, 20, third-year philosophy student at the University of York, is vegetarian. She says:

I’ve been vegetarian since I was eight. Eating animals is gross and sad, and the meat industry is bad for the environment and harmful to animals. Paul McCartney said: “If abattoirs had glass walls, then we would all be vegetarian.” People should cut down on meat, but I understand that not everyone can afford the time or money to follow a vegetarian diet.

The issue should possibly be higher on the political agenda, though there are arguably more important things happening, such as the rise in the need for food banks.
