Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide be legal?
Text: IN his opinion piece in MJA InSight, Professor Emeritus Ian Maddocks proposes an integration of palliative care, euthanasia, and physician assisted suicide (EPAS). As palliative care practitioners, we know this supposed common ground is both a contradiction in terms and contrary to sound medical practice.

From our experience of caring for people who are ill and vulnerable, legalising EPAS is unnecessary and unsafe.

Despite its inevitability, dying is not a popular topic for discussion in Australia today. In the words of American surgeon Dr Atul Gawande, we have “forgotten that we are mortal”. Death is not a medical or pharmacological event. It remains instead a profound mystery and the natural end of the complex journey of life. It is universal yet unique, personal but communal. It affects us all.

Dying can be traumatic, terrifying and painful for the patient, and challenging for the grieving family. In the face of inevitable death, some patients are willing to explore improbable alternative therapies, or burdensome or experimental treatments that may have a very low success rate. If people insist that “everything be done”, they are likely to die in the medically confronting environment of an intensive care unit, possibly prolonging the process of dying itself.

Good palliative care helps patients and families avoid both overtreatment and neglect of treatment. It enhances patient autonomy and decision-making capacity by improving symptom control and empowering patients to participate in their care. We affirm the patient’s right to choose their therapy; decline futile therapy; choose the place of dying; choose who should be present; receive the best possible relief of symptoms, even, on rare occasions, deliberate palliative sedation (not terminal sedation); and refuse to prolong the dying process. Ideally, this should be readily available for all those with life-limiting illness.

Autonomy does not include the right to demand that a clinician kills the person. Con
