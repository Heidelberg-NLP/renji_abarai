con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

There are a few different reasons often cited for fighting:

1) Built in competitive pressure valve: Playmaking -> Hitting -> Fighting

Hockey without contact checking (basically "shinny") is not the same game. As a result, body checking is integral for separating a player from the puck. A hard hit is a rather extreme example, but it serves both the purpose of disrupting the play and also intimidating the opposition's playmakers. This is where fighting comes in: it is considered a way to keep hitting and cheap shots in check in the same way that those acts reduce playmaking chances.

There are a few different reasons often cited for fighting:

1) Built in competitive pressure valve: Playmaking -> Hitting -> Fighting

Hockey without contact checking (basically "shinny") is not the same game. As a result, body checking is integral for separating a player from the puck. A hard hit is a rather extreme example, but it serves both the purpose of disrupting the play and also intimidating the opposition's playmakers. This is where fighting comes in: it is considered a way to keep hitting and cheap shots in check in the same way that those acts reduce playmaking chances.

Basically, there's a relationship between playmaking, hitting and fighting and extreme cases of any one of these aspects of the game represent players trying to create competitive equilibrium on the ice (i.e. can't score? Then hit and fight. If you can't fight, hit and score, etc.)

2) The Code

In the NHL, we're told players and coaches all share a tacit understanding that the protection of skilled players (i.e. the Gretzky-type scorers) is established via the concept of mutually-ensured destruction (i.e. the Matt Cooke-type agitators) and protection (i.e. the Marty McSorely-type enforcer).

Basically, any agitator can slash and cheap shot a skilled player to the infirmary in a game played with sticks. The only thing keeping the agitators from completely running amok is the threat of either the other team's "rat" taking out your star or their enforcer fighting your rat or important players.

In other words, it's understood that any physical license one team exerts on the game is open to retribution in kind from the other. Fighting is the extreme expression of this cycle of recidivism.

3) Entertainment via marginal talent

No one in pro-hockey likes to admit it, but most outright fights in the regular season are not in fact due to "the code" but rather mostly due to a desire for marginal players to create a spectacle to "fire up" fans and kindle the intensity of a slow or flagging match.

Players who regularly fill this role of token fighting sacrifice are generally not important to the final result, but do carve out a niche career by entertaining everyone with their predictable bouts. These fights though generally have absolutely no purpose as most are staged farces of animosity--both participants agree to "go" before the gloves are dropped". The violence is real but the meaning behind it is as relevant to the game as "pro" wrestling.

4) Tribalism

The origin of hockey is not akin to football (soccer) or rugby. It is generally considered to have been a game played between distinct cultural divides in melting pots like Quebec (First Nations, French Canadian, Irish). Fighting became enshrined in this context because of the tacit understanding that the violence on is a cultural pressure valve and as such relieves the animosity for escalating on the street.

Those are the most common rationales that comes to my mind. Of them, only the first makes any sense to me in this day and age. Even then, it's a tenuous one at best as the IIHF has shown we can have NHL-style hockey (Canada vs USA in the Olympics) with a rule-set that does not condone fighting.

The days of "The Code" are especially numbered as our growing concern over catastrophic brain injury is leading to hockey conduct being evaluated in fields where it just doesn't pass the smell test: the courts and insurance assessments. For example, "The Code" sounds really gallant until it lands a violent player in legal trouble where any defense on the basis of such a tacit understanding of brutality does not stand up to civil litigation (i.e. the pending endgame of Moore vs Bertuzzi).

Also, as player rights and contracts have matured so has the underlying worry about the long-term legal responsibility of the NHL in terms of its employee safety and compensation. Fighting isn't likely to die off because people within the game choose to get rid of it. Rather, it will be reduced to a vestigial quirk because insurers and litigators will eliminate the financial risks associated with random violence. After all, what underwriter would insure the contract of a player who is vulnerable to concussion once the medical evidence about head injury from condoned fighting is more robust?

Fighting isnt allowed in hockey, there is a 5 minute penalty for fighting….

But as it is a contact sport and has huge potential for dirty hits, stick infractions or yapping, players tend to take care of things on their own rather then let the refs do it…

I believe this is also a Canadian mentality, we dont need others to sort things out we do it on our own, there is a code and level of respect that may not be obvious if you havent played the game.

It’s seldom that you see fighting in non-combat sports. The thrill that you get from seeing your idols duke it out on ice is unparalleled! Making bets on who will win the fight adds more reason why it is allowed in the first place. Hockey players are generally tougher than athletes from other sports because of how the sport is played, so why not, right?

It's Canada's national sport. Canadians are essentially the only country that permits fighting in hockey. Fighting in hockey is taken very seriously by Canadians. If it were to be removed, the opposition in Canada would be deafening. The fighting is as real as it gets, as most goons go through fighting schools to learn how to fight while on ice skates. The majority of the fights take place between goons--trained fighters--and not between regular players. There are exceptions to this, as Milan Lucic of the Boston Bruins, and others are skilled players, but the majority of the fighters are just

I have always considered this to be an insight on Canada and Canadians. Such a nice and polite people--until they play hockey.

Hockey players are not really “allowed” to fight, according to the game’s rules. Fighting is an infraction, and it is punished by a penalty.

The penalty is quite tame when compared with other sports.

For many years, there has been a population of puckheads who claim that fighting is necessary so that the players can police the game. Nobody on the other team will hurt your star players if they know they’ll get beaten up if they try.

That, of course, is an indictment of the league management. They are supposed to do the policing. If they did it properly, then the fighting issue would not even come

The other reason fighting persists is because it attracts fans. In particular, some people who are not hockey fans watch games in hopes of seeing fights. The NHL doesn’t care whose money they collect, whether from hockey fans or from MMA fans and sadists. After all, professional sports are more “professional” than they are “sports”, at least to management. It’s not a game, it’s a business.

Fighting in hockey is a form of
protection - just like a brushback pitch, or directly hitting someone,
in baseball is done to protect fellow players and ensure the unwritten
codes of the game are adhered to. Looking at it this way, there's
actually much less "protecting" in hockey than in other sports.

Fighting doesn’t generally break out unless a player has breached certain unwritten rules, such as a check from behind, creative stickwork on someone’s anatomy, slew-footing a player or running the goalie. It is used to protect your team-members.
