Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Education, education, education. That was the pitch from Tony Blair in 1996 when he set out his party’s three main priorities for government. Two years later, he introduced tuition fees as a means of boosting funding to higher education in the UK. The argument was that it would allow greater investment in universities, improving standards and paving the way for world-class institutions.

Since then, the fees charged have shot up from £3,000 per year to over £9,000. Interest rates on student debt has also steadily increased, leaving many young people heavily indebted. The tuition fees policy was controversial at the time, and was later responsible for sinking the political fortunes of Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. It’s an issue that just won’t go away, and most recently landed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in hot water over accusations that he has broken his promises on student debt.

Not everybody believes tuition fees are necessary. Scotland has a policy of free-tuition for higher education. Tuition fees have been abolished in Germany (though they have recently been reintroduced for non-EU students). But are those systems really working out?

We had a comment sent in from Pedro, who thinks university education should be free for all. It’s a nice idea, but who pays for it?

To get a response to Pedro, we approached Andreas Schleicher, the Director for the Directorate of Education and Skills at the OECD. What would he say?

What is important is that the best and brightest have access to university, and not just the wealthiest. At the same time, somebody has to pay for it. So, we need to find is a way to share the costs and benefits among the public, government, and employers so it is actually the best and brightest that will get the best places in university…

Having no fees is not a guarantee to achieving greater equity. In fact, some of the most inequitable higher education systems are ones where there are no university fees, because what that often means is that governments often don’t invest very much money, and it means that places only go to those with the best credentials, which means those who can afford the most expensive private tutoring and schooling. So, I think no fee is no guarantee for greater equity. On the other hand, it’s true that fees can also be a source of inequality, no doubt about that. I think the answer is we’ve got to look at more creative ways of sharing costs and benefits.

We also had a comment from Catherine, who asks if we can really “afford to cripple young people with student debt”. Do student fees really place less of a burden on society? Or does society pay either way, with fees just shifting the burden from the wealthy to the poor?

I don’t quite agree with this… I think education is an investment, and I think it’s completely right that people, later in their lives when they have a decent salary, contribute back to society. You can do this like the Swedes and the Finns with higher taxes, but it’s basically the same thing. In Sweden, when you’re earning a lot, you pay higher taxes. It’s the same principle.

I think it’s absolutely adequate and fair to ask people who have benefited from a great education to give something back to society. The question is: how do you make sure the debt doesn’t discourage people from studying? That’s why I think income contingency is important, to make sure that people who pay back can actually afford to do so.

Should university education be free? Or is that model of higher education unsustainable when so many people want to go to university? Let us know your thoughts and comments in the form below and we’ll take them to policymakers and experts for their reactions!

    That’s a dumb question since something that has market value and involves a lot of work can’t by definition be free. A better question would be: who should pay for the cost of education (in Europe I guess)?

      Ar No

      Free as in “free of charge for students” stop pretending to not understand. The state should pay for it with taxes.

      Barbara Szela Lesniak

      Ar No In fact, it’s taxpayers who pay as state does not have money.

      Ultimately, the taxpayers, of course. But this is a worthy investment.

      Worthy investment for who exactly?….how does the average taxpayer benefit by paying for someone else’s education?
      I’m sure working class people who’s children have no hope of attending university would rather have their taxes paid on something that actually benefits them

      actually we could consider taxpayers should pay for it to internalise the good externalities generated by a more educated population, and have student take up the rest costs because they also made an investment for themselves doing studies (eventually this can be modulated to match student’s family situation etc)

      I strongly agree with Karlo!
      I guess wealthy people, international companies & the state.

    University education is not a good/service like the others produced in the market. In fact, it determines the role that each person plays in society. For that reason, it is simply unfair that such roles are established based on the wealth of the parents (if so, the kids of the wealthiest will remain rich, because they have access to better university titles). Indeed, this was exactly the target of the French Revolution: the ancien régime, a social system in which the roles in the social structure are inherited from the parents. Thus, if you want a society in which everybody is able to build his/her own destiny, regardless of the conditions of his/her parents, you need equal starting points for all, you need university systems to be financed by the tax-payers, that is to say, by the States.

      And for the students thmselves, that is free for all practical intents and purposes.

      Actually making it affordable would not change anything. The reason for even bringing up a free college education is to give the brightest students, who have low-income, an opportunity to study their passion. Yes tax payers are the ones paying for the cost of a free education, but with an influx of graduates going into their desired field of work this allows for a higher percentage of people with “good” paying jobs

    Yes, it should be free and at the same time should be granted students showing the best results first, in the limit of available quantity and conditional to a minimum level.

    Should university education be free?

    Education is not and will not ever be ‘free.’ It is paid for by our taxes. And at no time was we advised this part of our donation to the running costs of our country was going to be withdrawn by government policy.

    Reinstate the ‘free at the point of use’ education at all levels, we have been paying erroneously for, in haste and at once.

    Aslong as everyone can do any study or atleast the vast majority of it then there is no problem. If studies are so expensive that it becomes a wealth issue then the state should compensate.

      Like many others such as security services (fire fighters, police, ambulances etc). In that manner nothing is free.

    Investment into capital assets can be written off over time, thus the value is recovered.

    Investment into one’s education should be either free or follow the same principles.

    Currently we have an economic system that gives preference to capital assets over human assets and the consequences damage the quality of life.

    Meaning should we use taxs in order to invest on higher education? Yes of course. As long as that will not affect the quality of degrees and students.

    Róbert Bogdán

    No. It should become affordable as a result of a free market competition. The government should guarantee and oversee the freedom of the market, but it should never be a direct player or try to influence the market. I would abolish state universities entirely and keep as few regulations as possible.

      Yeah, that has worked wonders in the US. Just ask Trump university students.

      Andrius Zalitis

      That is the just the absolute worst way to go. In countries where this idea had a place to foster quality decreased and prices sky-rocketed, so even for the well-prepared students it was a slow disaster.

      Róbert Bogdán

      Yeah, that’s why the world’s top 20 universities are mostly from the US, UK or Singapore. And are mostly private, not state funded.
