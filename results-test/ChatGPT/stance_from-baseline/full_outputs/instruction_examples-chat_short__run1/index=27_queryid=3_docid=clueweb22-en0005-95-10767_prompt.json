Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Federal investigators are examining some well-timed trades made by golf champ Phil Mickelson and golf course owner and Las Vegas gambler William T. Walters.

No charges have been filed, and Icahn asserts that his record is "unblemished."

Steven A. Cohen ran one of the most admired hedge funds in the world, garnering some of the highest returns (and highest fees) in the industry until its spectacular fall from grace.

In 2010, federal agents raided the offices of two hedge funds founded by SAC Capital Advisors alumni, and later arrested several top traders at SAC, including Michael Steinberg and Matthew Martoma. Cohen was not charged, but SAC Capital itself pleaded guilty in November to fraud charges and agreed to pay $1.8 billion to settle charges that it allowed insider trading for more than a decade. Steinberg and Martoma are among those convicted.

Scott London (pictured at left), a senior partner at KPMG, had a habit of talking about work over dinner and golf with an old buddy. He later discovered his friend was making trades based on their banter, and began accepting cash gifts and Rolex watches in exchange for further tips. In total, London received about $70,000 in gifts before the SEC found them out. His friend Bryan Shaw pulled in roughly $1.3 million.

"I nearly threw up," London said of hearing just how much Shaw had profited from the scam. "I was led to believe the number was far less, closer to $200,000."

London in April to 14 months in prison and a $100,000 fine. Shaw pleaded guilty to insider trading charges as well.
