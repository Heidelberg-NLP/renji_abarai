Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Moderators are staffed during regular business hours (EST) and can only accept comments written in English. Statistics or facts must include a citation or a link to the citation.

There are 26 comments on Is Obesity a Disease?

  1. Excellent and balanced article . By rhe way -what is obesity and what is dis- eaae? Is it a chronic relapsing condition or a continuum/spectrum similar to alcohol and drug use disorders abd addiction with genetic bio- psycho-social and environmental determinants? Clarity and agreement on the meaning and mechanisns of obesity would be most helpful to begin to address social stigma and to protect the health of the public against extremes we often see today in self punishing dieting on the one hand and compulsive stress reducing comfort eating on the other. We can learn from the long standing debate on to what extent is unhealthy alcohol and drug use a dis- ease.

  2. This is ridiculous. Obesity should be considered part of a disease if someone has a thyroid problem that they cannot control or some debilitating disease which limits their ability to process food, exercise and/or diet correctly. Frankly, this is a way of making parents feel better because they let their fat children sit around and watch tv all day instead of sending them out for exercise.

    I have family who are fat and who literally sit around and feel sorry for themselves. They do not have a medical condition, other than type II diabetes. They also eat excessively and do not exercise.

    I feel awful for those who, because of some underlying medical condition, cannot lose or gain weight. But we as a society cannot apologize for the other fat people who will take this as justification for being lazy.

    In a time where medical expenses are high, we can’t afford to inflate our medical costs by inventing diseases, when we can fight other diseases which may help people with their weight.

    1. I agree with this. I mean I have the utmost sympathy for people who aren’t happy with themselves but it seems to create this notion that problems are “disorders” and can be solved by a pill or surgery. It’s not impossible to lose weight, albeit very difficult, especially when someone is obese, but hiding behind the defense of an illness is a bit of a cop out. Virtually everyone on earth has some sort of difficulty, and putting a blind eye to the fact that we are both sedentary and unhealthy is a bad thing.

      It isn’t fair to feel contempt for obese people, but certainly just accommodating obesity by making larger seats sends the wrong message. The predisposition to weight gain is certainly genetic in some ways, but one often isn’t born obese, they become so by way of their lifestyle. We need a cultural shift in America which puts an end to pill-popping as shortcuts.

    2. I’m an individual who has been challenged with the disease of obesity. I don’t hide behind it’s label just as I don’t hide behind the labels of heart disease, etc… I also don’t hide behind the label of obesity as a condition for folks that choose those semantics… Or, the label of heart condition.

      I firmly believe that genetic, social, environmental, & psychological factors can influence the disease. Furthermore, reliable treatment options are available. I’m no longer obese because through very hard work I fought the disease with psychotherapy for Binge Eating Disorder, gastric bypass surgery, mindful eating habits & exercise with a personal trainer.

      Many folks believe that gastric bypass is the easy way out. Ha! That’s ignorance. The surgery is one tool in the disease management process. One still must eat mindfully and exercise to manage the disease. Additionally, gastric bypass is the best option for successful and long-term treatment (see Cleveland Clinic).

      Am I cured? No! I will be required to eat mindfully, exercise, continue psychotherapy for the rest of my life. If I do not do so? The disease will rear its ugly head. I won’t allow it to control me. I’ve come too far to do otherwise.

      For folks who want to keep the semantically argument going… have at it! It means very little to my success to argue! The teeter-totter of the argument will only convince those on either side of it. For me, I recognized it was a disease in my life and did something about it!

  3. I was listening to the radio yesterday and heard talk show hosts debating this news. An announcer made a point to say on air, “don’t go buy the large bag of Doritos and instead buy a bag of vegetables. It’s as easy as that”. But it’s not as easy as that. Some poor neighborhoods without healthy foods (aka Food Deserts) do not have access to vegetables and healthy alternatives to a ‘Large Dorito Bag’. It’s hard for those in good neighbors to imagine those in impoverished areas, and we take even buying a bag of vegetables for granted. Although I agree, there are Americans who choose to not exercise and to eat bags on bags of Doritos, but let’s not forget those who can’t help it. This new classification will help those in poor neighborhoods (which is great) but it’s going to take much much more but this is the first step. So well done AMA!

    1. I do not necessarily agree that in areas of poverty people cannot afford vegetables. There was a time when I had to be on food stamps and was very careful with what I bought. When I compared the price of junk food, processed food, and so on, compared to vegetables, meat, fruit, and, this latter food was actually cheaper. I am not saying everyone who is impoverished can even afford those kinds of food and I understand that. But if they can afford a big bag of Doritos or super size their fast food, or other things of that nature, they can sure as heck afford meat, veggies, fruit, and some starch.

      I agree with the comments that say if someone has a medical condition that makes it hard to gain or lose weight, that is understandable. I have a thyroid condition and it is a slow process for me to lose weight and to keep it off, however, I am not obese, but I am not lazy either. However, the people who just eat junk food all day, sit around all day, and cry me a river because they are overweight or obese, I have no sympathy for. I am not saying everyone has to be stick thin either, but if someone actually eats right, is active, and is at least trying to maintain their weight, good for them. I do not know how I feel about calling obesity a disease. Yes, it is a problem in America, but I agree with some of the other comments, that if it is called a disease, for the obese who are just plain lazy, this will be cop-out for them. I think there are other ways that America can fight and help the obese without calling it a disease.

      1. Totally in agreement. It’s all about Food security I guess. You had the opportunity to use food stamps for healthy foods in your neighborhood, but there are stores that do not accept food stamps for certain healthy foods and accept food stamps for only unhealthy foods (because of price differences). Or, there are stores that label unhealthy foods as healthy (i.e. fruit juices, dairy products…etc.) These neighborhoods don’t give their constituents fair treatment.

        What I was trying to get at in my post was yes, this classification may help, but more importantly there should be an emphasis on building healthier neighborhoods and communities (because there will always be those better off who will choose to eat 1000000 bags of doritos, we should try to help those who can’t help it).

        Anyway, there is an excellent documentary called “Unnatural Causes” which I watched many times in my many classes (professors seems to love this documentary, which is great because I love it too).There is a section on neighborhoods and health. Here is a link to the documentary with the more relevant episode if you are interested! It’s great! Thanks for the response too, really well thought out :)

  4. Clever way to boost the pharmaceutical industry and take any responsibility away from the individuals. How do we supposedly contract this ‘disease’? Is it genetic? Because that would suggest that all those people who successfully overcame their obesity via exercise and a healthy diet actually altered their genetic make up.

    Also, how is it that so many individuals in countries like the US and UK have this ‘disease’, while in other countries this is simply not the case? I think a closer look at the food system here in the US would be much more useful, and would help explain why it is so hard for many people to lose the weight: High fructose corn syrup abounds, treats such as soda and ice creams come in GIGANTIC portions (even when a small is requested), and farmers have to jump through many hoops at great expense to have their food certified as organic, while the way is free and clear for others to mess with our food and use GMO’s as they see fit (which, btw, are banned in many non-obese European countries).
