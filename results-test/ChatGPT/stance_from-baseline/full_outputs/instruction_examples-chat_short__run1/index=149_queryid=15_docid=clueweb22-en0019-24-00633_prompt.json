Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Animals Be Used For Medical Science Research?

Decent Essays
Is the use of animals in medical science research justified? Should this be permitted? Why is it allowed that animals have to suffer so a human can use Windex or wear makeup? An estimated 26 million animals are used every year in the United States for scientific and commercial testing. Animal research testing is unnecessary to advance medical research any further. At one time when technology was not caught up with the rest of the world, it may have been useful because without animal testing, products would be based on theory. However, technology has come a long way in the last 50 years. Nonetheless, there seem to be many pros and cons to this topic as experts continue to argue on the way research should be done. Several medical research institutions make use of animals as test subjects. They are subject to experimentation and altered into conditions useful for acquiring knowledge about diseases we humans continue to fight or testing for potential treatments, solutions or cures. Rats and mice share several genetic and physiological traits with humans, which is why they are the most abused test subjects. Since they share so many of our human qualities they increasingly help further medical science research. Yes, there has been some animal testing contributed to life saving cures, but does that make it right? Proponents of animal testing also believe the animal benefits from the testing, which is the most outrageous thing I 've ever heard. If the vaccines for distemper,
