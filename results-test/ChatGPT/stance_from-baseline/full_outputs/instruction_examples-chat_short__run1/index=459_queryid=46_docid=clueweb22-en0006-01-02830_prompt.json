Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

3.

Small business that run on the internet will go out of business since they will not get any traffic to their sites without paying their ISP a fee to get traffic. (They will be Blocked) This will flood the job market with people put out of work. Thousands of companies will go out of business over night. Even GoDaddy and other hosting companies will drastically be affected and might go out of business if thousands of web sites cannot afford the ISP fee to get traffic. (Site Cancellations!)

4.

Less IT jobs will be available since large server farms will not be needed as much since many will not be able to afford there service anymore, this means less Shopping, Banking, or the use of any other online services that records need to be kept, like your passwords etc..

5.

Prices on everything will go up! Since many will cancel their services since they cannot afford them. The ones that remain with a service will have to bear the cost.

6.

It will affect the whole economy, everything from banking online, to Shopping online and even doing things like trading Stock online there will extra fees.

7.

You will only be able to go to sites that the ISP redirects you to. If the Web site has not paid a fee to the ISP you will never even know it’s there they will be blocked.

8.

Your internet speed will be throttled to very slow speeds unless you pay a hefty free to speed it up. (Might as well go back to dialup!) Extra cost on top of all other fees.

9.

No more surfing the net, it will be too costly, it will eat up your data allowance for the month.

10.

Gaming with Xbox, PS4 or PC will be prohibitive due to the speeds needed to pay lag free and most that will not be able to pay the fee involved. This will put businesses that support this industry out of business due to people not buying their gear anymore since they cannot use it without lag or have no internet access, and in effect even potentially put companies like EA out of business at some point since most of their games are internet based people will stop buying them since they cannot play them online anymore.

11.

Shopping online will decline drastically, No internet no Shopping! Cost will be passed on!

12.

You will have NO say in what you can see online, what websites you visit, games you play, interests you have, it will all be governed by if that website can afford to pay ALL the ISP providers a fee to send traffic to them. If they can’t you don’t see it.

13.

Your personal information can be and will be sold and spied upon by the ISP the government and anyone else that wants it or buys it.

14.

You will not be allowed to view see any information other than what they want you to see. Any other political viewpoints other than there’s will be blocked.

15.

You will not be able to go directly to your favorite website anymore if they have not paid their fee to the ISP. They will be blocked and you will be redirected to a site that has paid their fee.

16.

Netflix and other will raise their fees to pay the fees they have to, too the ISPs. And you will pay the ISP a fee to have fast enough speed to view shows lag free. So, you will pay twice.

17.

Any Company that uses the internet in anyway will have to pay extra fees to get any traffic at all to their sites even the big companies and the cost will be passed down to the little guy.

18.

You will be told and controlled what sites you can see and get too since there will be a limited amount of internet sites they approve of or that have paid their fees to get traffic.

19.

Total censorship of what you see and watch

Simply put the cost of the internet, for most will be prohibitive, many businesses will go out of business, Cost and fee’s will go up for everyone, It will cost many jobs in the IT and gaming industry, Online Shopping will decline, Banking and trading will decline online, In Effect it will throw us back to the dialup stone age! Unless you pay,pay,pay! And even then, you will not be able to access what you want if they don’t like it!

I believe that net neutrality is ABSOLUTELY something that needs to be kept. Even though some may argue that it is better without it because of limited government control, this is not the case with net neutrality. As many of you probably already know, net neutrality was the regulations put in place by the American government pertaining to the internet. This allowed the government to prevent internet providers, such as Comcast, to slow down services, block websites, and charge people more money to have a higher speed internet connection.

I believe that net neutrality is ABSOLUTELY something that needs to be kept. Even though some may argue that it is better without it because of limited government control, this is not the case with net neutrality. As many of you probably already know, net neutrality was the regulations put in place by the American government pertaining to the internet. This allowed the government to prevent internet providers, such as Comcast, to slow down services, block websites, and charge people more money to have a higher speed internet connection. Net neutrality, as explained by ABC News, is the agreement that Internet Service Providers (ISP’s) will treat everyone on the internet the same and not to slow down or speed up other services. As you can see, this agreement benefits the majority of the population and only restricts a few companies.

Net neutrality is beneficial for many reasons. For one, this allows smaller businesses to thrive and prosper on the internet. Many small businesses don’t have the money or resources like large corporations or businesses such as McDonald’s or Target. Because of this, smaller businesses cannot afford ad agencies or promotional content so they turn to the internet for help. With just a basic knowledge of javascript and html, anyone can create a website and smaller businesses do just that. This method of self-promoting greatly benefits the company and is a more affordable alternative to the traditional TV or radio ads. This concept of net neutrality is a large contributor to the rise of internet startups over the last decade. In fact, Amazon wouldn’t have been possible if not for net neutrality. Without net neutrality, many small businesses will be pushed out of the market by large corporations and many websites that exist now would not have been possible. Another benefit to net neutrality is that it insures an open internet and ensures equal access. While some people may be able to afford the luxury “internet fast-lanes,” other people, such as many middle-class american citizens and public services won’t be able to. Currently, the poorest school districts can access the same resources on the internet as the richest millionaires. Without net neutrality, public services such as libraries, schools, and shops, won’t be able to afford the same information as more affluent people. In an article on Wired, Klint Finley argues that without net neutrality, it will be harder for students to afford video lessons. With the advancement of the internet, more and more educational content is available to students. People without access to a nearby hospital can take nursing classes and people without a nearby college can take programming lessons. Without net neutrality, these valuable services could be rendered to expensive for schools and students to afford. Instead of encouraging the growth of learning, anti net neutrality is stifling it. In the absence of net neutrality, ISPs now have the power to potentially do whatever they please. They can slow websites down if the owners can’t afford it, they can block certain websites and content or make them so slow that they are rendered useless, sell your information to advertisers so that you get those annoying calls in the middle of dinner, and block collaboration resources such as github and linux among other things.
