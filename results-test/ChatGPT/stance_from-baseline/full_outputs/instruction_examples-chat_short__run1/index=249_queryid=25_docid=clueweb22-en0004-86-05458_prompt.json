Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

5 Reasons Why Education Should Be Free

Have you ever looked at the rapidly skyrocketing figure indicating your student debt and wondered why you should be forced to pay for an education? I know I have and with the increasing popularity of socialism amongst millennials I’m not alone.

Today, Australian University students are often pushed into a lifetime of debt in order to access tertiary education. You’d think we’d get a high-quality product with that price tag but no dice. The successive cuts to the sector and explosion of enrolments since the introduction of the demand driven system have resulted in a noticeable decline in teaching and learning quality. University management has responded to this context with vicious restructures, empty advertising campaigns and a reliance on international student fees to prop up the sector.

In a world of rapidly changing technology and jobs, access to education is vital – whether you are leaving school, changing careers or looking to gain new skills and knowledge.

There is an alternative. Free education is not a pipe dream in Australia, with all fees abolished in 1974 by the Whitlam government until the eventual introduction of HECS in 1989. Germany has done it, joining many other countries in Europe. Such socialist policies have gained momentum amongst millennials with the rise of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn – unsurprising considering they are figures in countries where you also get crippled by student debt.

Here are some reasons why we should seriously consider scrapping the price tag attached to studying once again.

1.) It Would Combat Class Inequality

Australia likes to pretend it’s the country of the fair go when in reality class disadvantage is deeply rooted in every aspect of our society. Just look at our hideous treatment of welfare recipients, the overfunding of private secondary schools and demonisation of the working class. Making education free would attract socio-economically disadvantaged students, who are averse to being saddled with debt for much of their working lives.

2.) The Social Benefits Outweigh the Financial Cost

Research proves that free education is in the public good. University graduates tend to pay back the cost of their degrees to the state through tax and their contribution to the running of society. It combats overpopulation, with tertiary educated women more likely to have fewer children. Other reasons include better health, more interesting workplaces, a greater collective capacity for political reasoning, among many others.

3.) Education Can Change the World

Commodifying education is a mistake because it assumes a public good is a private one. Education is a life long process and should be encouraged at all stages of our lives. With our society fighting catastrophic climate change and the rise of the far right, we need better-informed citizens and a healthier democracy.

4.) Education is a Right, Not a Privilege

The idea that one person is more deserving of a quality education cradle to grave is so 1800s guys. Today, many students are expected to take on part-time work in order to be full-time students or to survive on Youth Allowance, which pays as little as $20 a day. Only the very lucky are able to pursue studies without constant bone-chilling anxiety. To each according to his ability, to each according to his means. Stat!

5.) No Cuts! No Fees! No Corporate Universities!

Unfortunately, nothing is given to those who ask nicely. It seems students in Australia will have to collectively fight for a return to free education. We’ve done it before, coming together to beat back fee deregulation just a few years prior. Out of the classrooms and onto the streets baby!
