Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should the death penalty be allowed?
Text: Should the death penalty be illegal? | Debate.org
  • Kill all the jewsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

    Hitler would agree with this
    The death penalty should b e ban. It has sentenced innocent people to death but later found innocent. There's a chance that they can convict the wrong person. We damage our international reputation by using the death penalty. Our peer countries disagree with the death penalty and if we lose the our reputation then bad things could happen.

  • Kill all the jews

    The death penalty should b e ban. It has sentenced innocent people to death but later found innocent. There's a chance that they can convict the wrong person. We damage our international reputation by using the death penalty. Our peer countries disagree with the death penalty and if we lose the our reputation then bad things could happen.

  • Eye for an Eye is Antiquated Concept

    An eye for an eye is an antiquated concept used by nomadic peoples thousands of years ago. Today, we are allegedly civilized and no longer barbaric. As such, our criminal justice system shouldn't be about killing criminals who killed their victims. Jesus said love the sinner but hate the sin and to forgive your enemies. If we live in a Judeo-Christian country, then that's the example we should follow.

  • The death penalty should be illegal.

    The death penalty should not be legal because it is a cruel punishment. Furthermore, a lot of criminals have been exonerated because of DNA evidence that become uncovered after the trial. It is not right to execute people when further evidence might prove that they were innocent the whole time.

  • Yes, it should.

    Yes, I believe that the death penalty should be illegal. There is too much room for error in our court system. To this day, innocent people are executed in the United States. Additionally, putting people to death is barbaric and the United States should hold ourselves to a higher standard. It makes the government stoop to the level of the murderers.

  • The Death Penalty Should Be Illegal

    Yes, the death penalty should be illegal. Every living person has a right to life that cannot be given up. It is inalienable. As such, no matter what heinous things a person has done, that right cannot be taken away from them. The death penalty is immoral and should be abolished.

  • Yes, it should

    Death sentence is the same as murder. It simply means that you killed someone who killed someone and to my opinion it is called double murder. There is every 100% chance possibility that an innocent person is being sent to prison and later given a death penalty without any offense.

  • It's not moral

    Just because the crime the person committed is immoral, doesn't mean the United States has the right to be. No one has the right to take another person's life away. The death penalty, in my opinion, is just stooping to the offender's level and is just as bad. The real penalty would be having them live the rest of their life in jail.

  • Not Justified.

    The death penalty should be illegal. There is always a possibility that the wrong person could be put to death. Even if it was the right person, letting them get the easy way out may not be the best way to punish them, so really, it's just a bad idea. It should be banned.

  • Yes it should be

    The death penalty should be illegal. First of all the united states judicial system is not always accurate. So there is a chance of putting an innocent man to death. Also if that person did do the crime, i feel like the best punishment is to let them live their lives in a prison cell. Giving them the death penalty is an easy way out.

  • NO IT SHOULD NOT

    The death penalty has the possibility of wrongful executions. It is an easy way out for criminals living a life of suffering. The death penalty could be seen as an eye for an eye. If we kill murderers why don't we rape rapists or rob robbers? My opponent may say that the death penalty will deter crime. This is untrue. There are about 19 executions per year and this will not in any way end off killing. Also, if the state gives off the message as "killing people who are bad is okay", then what do you think others will believe? My opponent may also say that the death penalty will keep prisons from over crowding. This is also untrue from such a small number of executions each year. Wrongful execution is possible, for search up carlos deluna, a man who was wrongfully convicted even after overlooking evidence of his innocence. I do not believe in the death penalty. To me it is sending off a worthless and negative message.

  • No this country needs it.

    We are terrible people some times and do horrible things out of revenge and hate. If some killers were still alive the murder rate would sky rocket. There is always a chance someones innocent but that rarely happens. People who are using the fact that are using justice system isn't all ways right, well its right most of time.

  • Only when they are certain that the person commited the crime.

    The death penalty should be used when they are certain that they have the right person, in cases of murder. Why should the murderer be allowed to live when the person that they killed wasn't allowed to live? Any time a person murders an innocent one, they should be put to death. Putting someone in prison for a long amount of time doesn't make up for the death of a human being. You kill someone in cold blood - you should be put to death.

  • So the death penalty is when someone kills someone else. Many people disagree and others don't. I disagree and here is some reasons why.

    I for one think it shouldn't be banned because who says that the murderer won't do it again upon release. Getting their life taken is fair because what if they killed more than one person before getting captured what if they killed young children then they deserve that life to be taken, and it's not just that person they are hurting they are hurting that person's loved ones what if that person had children what if it happened to you your family would miss you wouldn't they want that person to pay for what they did.

  • Its not right

    People who end up getting wrongfully punished with Capital punishment wont be able to live the life they want to because the government convicted them with something they didn't do. People who end up getting convicted and are innocent, their family will lose a loved one. I believe it should be illegal

  • Thed eath penalty has its place.

    The death penalty has its place in a civilized society. I believe that the death penalty should be used in cases that are so extreme and so far beyond human comprehension that the only possible outcome is the permanent removal of the offender from society via their death sentence after a thorough trial.

  • Death Penalty Necessary

    In today's world, the death penalty needs to be kept in place. There's no reason we should make the death penalty illegal today. The death penalty helps the country reduce costs and get rid of undesirables rather than letting them consume state resources for many decades in a needless manner.
