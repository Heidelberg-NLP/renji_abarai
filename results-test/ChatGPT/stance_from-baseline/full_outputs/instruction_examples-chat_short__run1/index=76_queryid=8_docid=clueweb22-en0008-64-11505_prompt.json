Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Abortion Should It Be Legal

In today’s society there are very many issues that are being debated over in our Judicial system, but the one Issue that seems to never go away Is abortions. Everyone debates whether it should be legalized or Illegal. Of course there are many that are for it and those that are against it, but what side is right? Is there even a right or wrong when it comes to a topic of this nature?

The right to have an abortion should e a woman’s decision and no one should have the right to tell them differently. In the United States everyone has the right to make their own decisions without the fear of the Government stepping In to take control, especially when It comes to the choices women makes about their own body! According to Wisconsin Republican representative Paul Ryan “We don’t want a country where abortion is simply outlawed; we want a country where it isn’t even considered. “(Reeve, 2013).

There are several reasons that cause for abortions to be legal such as; unwanted pregnancy, sexual abuse, pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, birth control or contraceptive failure and to prevent the birth of a child born with birth defects or severe medical conditions that could endanger the child’s health. These are Just some of the reasons why abortion should be legal. II. Body paragraph #1 – Topic Sentence #1 The decision to have an abortion is a woman’s choice and no one person or group of individuals should have the right to make that decision for them.

As united States citizens we are entitled to make our decisions from what car to drive, what immunity to live in, whether to smoke cigarettes and whether to have an abortion or not. These are all examples of choices that we as united States citizens have the ability to make, why should It be different when It comes to the choice about having an abortion or not. A woman’s decision to have an abortion may be due to several reasons such as; financial, rape/incest and prevent a child being with serious medical condition, but it still remains a woman’s choice! . A. Supporting Evidence 1 . The belief that individuals should be able to make their own choices also shapes attitudes about what abortion policy should be. This powerful Impulse Is present In many areas of life besides abortion. A Honeysuckle Partners In April 1994 found a quarter of respondents agreed with the statement that smoking is a bad habit and our society should do everything possible to stamp it out. The majority seventy-three percent opted instead for smoking may be a bad habit, but everyone should have the right to make his or her own choice about whether to smoke or not. ” (Lead & Bowman, 1999). Insensible. But the more successful they’ve been at limiting abortion rights, the more we’ve intruded into private medical decisions that ought to be made by women and their doctors” Cones, 2012). B. Explanation 1. The main focus is of this choice and whether that choice should be left up too group of individuals. We have the ability to make choices that affect the way we live our lives every day, the same should be for the topic of abortion. The reasons behind a woman’s decision to have an abortion should not be in question; the choice is theirs to make not anyone else’s.

Whether this choice is considered morally wrong by some the fact still remains the choice belongs to that individual. . The choice to have an abortion is a personal decision that should be made between the potential parents and an approved medial professional. The fact that Government has any involvement in this decision is an intrusion into our personal life and there is no place for that! These decisions are difficult enough for the potential parents without having the Government involved. C. So What?

As a United States citizen we have the right to make choices that may affect lives in a positive way or negative way those decisions stem from what kind of car we drive, hat type of employment we choose, where we choose to live and whether to choose the option of abortion. All these decisions have factors that affect them such as; financial, personal and medical but the Government should not be one of them. Our lives are determined by the decisions we make day to day and we should be free to make these choices without any group of individuals having a say so in that.

The choice to have an abortion is our choice and no one else because it affects us and only us. Ill. Body paragraph #2 – Topic Sentence #2 In our society there are those that are against abortion stating that it is morally rang. They outline several reasons such as; ethical reasons, emotional and scientific reasons. There are arguments that state abortion is unsafe and is a form of birth control for some who are not responsible enough to use proper birth control. These arguments all revert back to the issue that an unborn fetus is a living, breathing organism and have the same rights Just as any other individual. A.

Supporting Evidence 1 . “The child before birth is equal in dignity and rights to the child after birth these rights, like all human rights are inalienable. Being born cannot be used as an exclusionary criterion to “disappear” the rights of the child before birth. No one child has a greater right to be born than any other. Disability, non-preferred sex, illegitimacy, fathers a rapist, mother doesn’t want the child-? none of these distinctions can be used to deny the child before birth the right to be born free and equal in dignity and rights” Joseph, 2009). 2. “Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life.

Why should taking someone’s life when they’re in the womb be any different than taking their life when they’re a baby in the crib? Pro- hooch advocates claim this isn’t a real baby only to Justify their wrong acts in their own minds. Even if you don’t believe abortion is murder, it still demeans the value of human life, since women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because 1 . The argument is that abortion is looked at by some as a form of murder. A fetus life should be Just as important as any other life regardless of whether fully conceived or not.

There are reasons that one may choose abortion, but consideration should be taken for the fetus that is living and breathing in the womb. The option of earth control or abstinence is always a safer option to abortion regardless of the circumstances behind the decision to choose an abortion. A fetus has rights like all individuals and these rights should not be taken lightly. Abortion is not the answer; safe sex and proper birth control is, abortion is not a form of birth control. 2. The right to life does not start when a child is taken from the womb, it starts when a child is conceived.

To deny a fetus the right to life is morally wrong and unjust to many in our society. No matter whether you believe abortion is murder it still is the taking of a fife without adhering to that child’s rights and that is a crime in itself. C. So What? To take an unborn child’s life is murder not abortion. Every child or fetus has rights and those rights should be enforced to the fullest. Many use abortion as a form of birth control and do not look at the ethical reasons, emotional and scientific reasons that make the process of abortion morally unjust.

There is no logical reason to deny an unborn child or fetus the right to life no what the circumstances are behind the choice for abortion. The choice in our society should be safe sex, abstinence not abortion. IV. Body paragraph #3 – Topic Sentence #3 The fetus/child while in the woman’s womb is not an individual organism and is dependent on the mother for support. Therefore how can one suggest that a fetus has the right to life if it is not an independent organism? A woman has the right to determine the right to choose whether to terminate the life of fetus in her womb, it is a about choice.

The notion that many women are using abortion as a form of birth control is absurd. Many women choose abortion due financial problems, danger to herself or the fetus, sexual abuse/rape and maybe it is Just an unplanned pregnancy. These reasons may not be acceptable to some critic’s, but these critics are not in her shoes. 1. “One of the issues being made is that the fetus is not a human being because it is in the womb, totally dependent on the mother, and therefore has no right at all. In other words it does not count! ” (Chug, 2003). . “Another argument is that says a woman has the right to do whatever she wants with her body, and therefore she has the right to terminate the life of her child inside her womb. ” (Chug, 2003). 1. A fetus is exactly what is it a fetus, that means that it is not a living and breathing individual organism. The simple fact that a fetus is reliant on a woman that holds it in her womb is proof that a fetus cannot be considered an individual being. In our society a fetus is not living until it has left the womb and started its life.

Until that point has been reached that fetus has no rights and its mother makes all the decisions. 2. We all the right to do whatever we want to do to our bodies and for a the condition of her body and what ailments she may be going through. If a woman feels that she is not financially, mentally, physically ready to take on the responsibility f bringing a child, then she should have the choice/right to choose abortion over bringing a child into this world if she feels she is an unfit parent.
