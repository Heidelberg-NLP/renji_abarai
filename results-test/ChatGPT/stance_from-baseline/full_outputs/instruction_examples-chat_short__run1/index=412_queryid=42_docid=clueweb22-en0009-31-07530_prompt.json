Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Fighting Be Allowed In Hockey?

Shane House@sghcantcopyAnalyst IJanuary 2, 2009

First, I just want to say that my condolences go out to his family, friends, and teammates. Don was both a good hockey player and human being, and his life was taken much too soon.

But this tragedy brings about a question that seems to be coming up more and more as of late.

Should fighting be allowed in the NHL?

Fighting has been a part of hockey since, well, the beginning of hockey. Players and fans alike find that fighting allows players to solve their frustration on the ice. It keeps more skilled players from getting hurt by sticking up for them and keeping agitators from messing with their game.

But the troubling fact is that no matter who fights, big or small, everyone has an equal chance of getting hurt.

You could break your nose, hand, wrist, jaw, get a concussion, or in the most extreme case, hit your head on the ice.

Some suggestions have been made to fix the issue with fighting and keeping players safe.

A few skeptics have suggested that it should be mandatory to keep helmets on during a fight, so if players do fall and hit their head on the ice, they will be properly protected.

I find two issues with this suggestion.

First, no matter how tight the strap is on a helmet, in a scuffle or fight, it will sometimes come off regardless of how hard you try to keep it on. Because of this, players would probably be subject to questionable calls which would lead to more controversy.

Second, if you leave helmets on during hockey fights, it makes players more prone to breaking their hands and wrists.

During a fight, players sometimes don‚Äôt have a chance to see where they are punching, so they have no control on where their fists will land. Most of the time they do get hit in the face, but sometimes they miss and hit the players head instead.

If the helmet were to be on when his happens, there would be a good chance that a player will break their hand or wrist on the helmet, which will hold a player out of hockey for a few weeks, minimum.

While one issue is more obvious than the other, both are valid arguments against the implementing of rule changes towards fighting.

Finally, some skeptics have also said that instead of ‚Äúrefereeing‚Äù hockey fights, we should just ban hockey fights all together, ultimately just giving suspensions and misconducts to whoever is involved in a fight.

To me, this seems to be a little extreme and to be honest, not a very thought-out idea.

Fights allow players to relieve frustration on the other team in a mediated environment. Anytime that one player has a distinct advantage over the other opponent, the referee steps in to stop the scuffle and separate the players.

Fighting also keeps players from hitting the star players who can‚Äôt defend themselves, the same way a grinder or enforcer can.

One argument has been made that there is no fighting in the playoffs, which means that the NHL should have no use for fighting.

This isn‚Äôt true.

Players in the playoffs don‚Äôt want to take a stupid penalty that could hinder their team from winning a crucial game in a series. If a player were to try to start a fight in the playoffs, he would run risk of getting a penalty that would change the momentum of the game, and ultimately, the playoff series.

Plus, the teams have nothing to lose and everything to gain at this point, which forces players to keep their emotions at bay and do the smart things it takes to win, instead of making the mistakes that cause you to lose.

In an 82 game schedule, you play teams that aren‚Äôt doing well and are constantly frustrated because of this. If a team were being blown out and were really angry at the situation, eventually it would force a player to do something that is even worse than fighting, like two-hand a guy with their stick, or hit a guy from behind.

Fighting keeps players from doing more stupid things, and ultimately keeps players from getting more seriously injured.
