pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Text: Golf a Lifelong Sport - Naples Golf Homes | Naples Golf Guy

Golf a Lifelong Sport

Golf a Lifelong Sport

RelationshipsGolf is a lifelong sport you can play into your 90’s. So, why should you consider taking up the sport? First, it is a great way to stay active and strengthen your core.  Whether you are looking to remain active, build relationships or just have a good time, there are many health and mental benefits to playing the game of golf.  And, did I mention you don’t have play like a pro to benefit from the sport?  Here’s just a few of the reasons to make golf your lifelong sport of choice.

 

Benefits of Golf as a Lifelong Sport

Exercise – Although you might be tempted to take a golf cart, if you do decide to walk the course and carry your bag or use a pull cart, you could cover 4 to 8 miles during the round.  That translates to 9,200 to 18,400 steps!

Build New and Existing Friendships – Golf is more than a sport.  It is a great way to networking on the golf courseget together with friends.  Enjoy a round of golf and then head to the 19th hole for a refreshing beverage and food.

Family Connections – If your whole family plays the game, it’s a great way to get 2-4 hours of together time with your significant other and children.  What a better way to spend the day then on a golf course with those that are closest to you.

Networking – Golf is a great opportunity to network and strengthen relationships with clients.

Improve your Health – Walking has been shown to have a positive effect on cholesterol, body composition and metabolism, according to a review in the British Journal of Medicine.

Enhance your Mental Health – If you are able to hit a very small ball, then you are forced to concentrate which may help improve your problem-solving abilities.

Paradise Coast:

Naples is known as the golf capital of the world.  You may be surprised to learn there are more than 150 golf courses throughout southwest Florida. What better place to buy a second home, relocate or retire if you are a golfer?

Begin Your Own Naples Property Search:

So, if you’re ready to begin your property search, I encourage you to explore my website to find information about communities in Naples, Bonita Springs, Estero or Ft. Myers.  If golf is your game, I specialize in golf community real estate and would be happy to help you navigate the more than 100 different golf communities in our area.  If you prefer a more direct approach, I will provide a list of properties that meet your criteria and/or communities that meet your needs.

Bottom Line:

If you are buying a home in a golf community, you will find it is more complex than a normal home purchase.  As you can probably imagine, there are significant differences between golf courses.  Also, there are hidden fees, different membership fees, pet restrictions and very different demographics in each community.

Or, if you are considering new construction, remember the contractor’s real estate agent represents the builder’s best interest, not yours.  There is no cost to you to have an agent represent you. In fact, I can help you save money and negotiate for extras which the builder may not let you know about.

So, if you are looking for information about a specific community in Bonita Springs, Estero or Naples, contact me and I will prepare a custom market report for you.  Most importantly, I can provide the market information and insights to help make sure you select your dream home.

Lastly, I will handle all of the contract negotiations for your property from the first offer to close.
