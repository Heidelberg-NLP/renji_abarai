Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Is vaping with e-cigarettes safe?
Text: Home Juul and E-Cigarettes

Juul and E-Cigarettes

E-cigarettes are devices that use batteries and a heating element to turn flavored liquids into a vapor that can be inhaled. Often marketed as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes, virtually all vaping liquids contain highly addictive nicotine. E-cigs, including Juul, have been linked to seizures and other serious side effects.

Electronic cigarettes are more popularly known as e-cigarettes, e-cigs or vape pens. They include vape pens, vaporizers, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookahs and e-cigars, which are all classified as electronic nicotine delivery systems, or ENDS.

The most popular e-cigarette is Juul, but hundreds of different e-cigarette brands are currently available to consumers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave all e-cigarette makers until Sept. 9, 2020, to submit an application for FDA approval if they want to continue selling their products in the United States.

Using e-cigs is referred to as vaping or juuling. E-cigarettes deliver a liquid to users as a vapor instead of a harsher smoke. The liquid contains a mixture of nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin, and sometimes flavorings and other unknown ingredients.

Did You Know?
E-cigs were originally designed by a Beijing pharmacist Hon Lik in 2003, making the product a relatively new phenomenon. Lik was a heavy cigarette smoker. His father was also an avid smoker and died of lung cancer. Lik’s first e-cigarettes hit the U.S. and European markets in 2007.

Users have reported a growing list of potential e-cigarette side effects such as seizures, strokes, respiratory failure and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, or BOOP.

Among the most serious side effects is EVALI, which stands for e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury. The condition causes severe lung damage that frequently requires patients to use a mechanical ventilator.

By early 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that vitamin E acetate was “strongly linked” to the EVALI outbreak. The chemical is sometimes used as a thickening agent in vape fluids containing THC – the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.

The CDC received 2,807 reports of EVALI cases or deaths as of Feb. 18, 2020. According to data from Jan 2020, of the 2,022 hospitalized EVALI patients, about 82 percent had vaped THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. But 14 percent had vaped nicotine products exclusively.

The lung injury outbreak has been followed by a wave of states and cities ordering e-cigarette bans in their jurisdictions.

What Is Juul?

Juul is the most popular e-cigarette marketed in the United States. The brand accounts for about 75 percent of all e-cigs sold. It is one of just five brands that control about 97 percent of the e-cigarette market. The other four are Vuse, MarkTen, Blu and Logic.

The trendy e-cigs appeal to young adults and teens who often don’t realize Juul products are e-cigarettes or contain nicotine. Public health researchers have found teens using the term “juuling” instead of “vaping” to distinguish Juul from other e-cigs even though the two activities are the same.

When Juul first hit the market in 2015, its vape liquid contained much higher levels of nicotine than e-cigs that had already been on the market. Each Juul pod contains as much nicotine as 20 regular cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Juul’s sleek design and addictive nicotine are credited for the device’s widespread popularity with teens and young adults, as well as Juul’s rapid dominance of the e-cigarette market.

The lawsuits claim the company marketed nicotine products to minors and Juul devices led to serious health problems. Lawyers expect people to file more Juul lawsuits in the litigation as time passes.

Who Uses Juul and Other E-Cigarettes?

Young people are more likely than adults to use Juul or other e-cigarettes in the United States, according to the CDC.

The health protection agency reports that 2.8 percent of American adults used e-cigarettes in 2017. Among adult e-cig users, 58.8 percent also continued to smoke tobacco cigarettes while 29.8 percent were former tobacco smokers. Another 11.4 percent of e-cig users had never been regular tobacco smokers.

A 2018 report from Truth Initiative, an anti-smoking group, found that 15- to 17-year-olds were 16 times more likely to have used a Juul e-cig than older age groups. The report also found more than half of Juul users were younger than 18 the first time they tried the device.

Teen Use of Juul and Other E-Cigarettes

Teen use of e-cigarettes has increased rapidly since the introduction of Juul in 2015. In 2018, the U.S. Surgeon General declared an “epidemic of youth e-cigarette use.” He pointed to surges in the number of teens using e-cigs and the dangers of nicotine to brain development in young people.
