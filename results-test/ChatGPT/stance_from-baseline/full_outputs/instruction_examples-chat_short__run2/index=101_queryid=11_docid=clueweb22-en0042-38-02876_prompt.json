Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Performance-Enhancing Drugs be Legalised?

EPO Every now and then I get an email from a reader asking whether all the anti-doping hand-wringing is necessary. Why go through so much trouble to hunt down picograms of banned molecules in the Contador “steak” case when the quantities involved don’t alter the racing? Some see a bigger picture where dopers are more than just a step ahead of the testers. Why not just let adults decide what to do? It’s not just a question for curious newcomers. Julian Savulescu is a professor of ethics at the University of Oxford and he says prohibition is only helping organised crime and that doping should be allowed for the good of sport. This is an argument worth exploring. I think the basic premise is so wrong it needs shooting down with a hail of bullet points. Professor Savulescu’s thoughts are interesting and stimulate debate but away from theory, cycling’s own past suggests it can’t work.

The general argument of legalising performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) tends to say that because it is difficult to stop determined cheats that it’s not worth imposing the cost and even the pretence of testing. Like other forms of prohibition, banned PEDs just sends athletes into clandestine channels and this tends to profit the suppliers, whether crooked doctors or outright criminals. Far better to make doping legal so that athletes turn to regular doctors and safe advice. It sounds seductive but for me it doesn’t work. Here’s why:

  • first this is not like prohibition of alcohol or narcotics. Many drinkers might want a bottle of beer or a glass of wine but in doping the point is to get the edge on a rival, to consume more than others. To borrow the drinking language, if someone has a tipple of EPO, someone else will binge-inject. Indeed if some athletes were to take substances under correct medical supervision then others will not. They will seek out doctors willing to give them megadoses or harmful medicine in order to get an edge. There’s no moderation here, you go from top-up to health risk in no time.
  • second most banned substances are banned for a reason. Take growth hormone, consume enough to alter performance and you are consuming enough to cause medical concerns, such as the raising the risk of cancer or heart disease
  • there’s also a practical consideration as drugs like the blood-boosting EPO just aren’t available for sports use. A doctor can’t prescribe them unless a patient is sick and even if sport allowed the use of these substances, wider society still regulates pharmaceuticals more than almost any other product
  • Also would you like to turn pro if taking pharmaceuticals was part of being a professional? Would this not encourage amateurs to imitate? Again it does not seem a very encouraging prospect

Mythologies: There are other reasons too. Cycling’s suffered from doping because fans did not know what they were watching was real. But imagine if we took this further, you could quickly dehumanise the sport. The Tour de France and most other races trade on a reputation for toughness, of being longer and harder than any other mainstream sports contest. To this day the public wonders how riders cope with the rain, the heat and the distance. But if they believe the answer is found inside a syringe then there’s a good chance they wouldn’t bother to watch. A race at 43km/h is not necessarily any more interesting than one at 39km/h but the amazement vanishes if the riders become computer games characters with infinite lives and endless energy re-ups. Professor Savulescu The Academic case As you’d hoe from a professor of ethics at Oxford University, Professor Savulescu’s argument is more sophisticated. He’s saying that elite sports have become genetic sampling events where the winners represent a genetic elite and sometimes a financial elite too. This contest devalues sporting notions of determination, commitment, tactics and training. Given this we should allow some moderate use of PEDs to rebalance things, just as athletes can spend time and resources on nutrition, training or equipment. Professor Savulescu is also pointing out that chasing down every last molecule of banned substances is excessive, that the money spent on the “war on doping” should be more pragmatically spent on protecting athlete health. Given doping is a fact in many sports, why not accept this and try to manage it? For example if some are going to cheat why not let others use certain substances under appropriate supervision so they can close the gap with the cheats? This way an “innocent” athlete does not lose out so much and the “cheat” who goes to excessive lengths does not gain such an advantage. In short we change the dynamics of the cost-benefit so that the cheats don’t get so far ahead. It’s this managed aspect that seems to differentiate the professor’s argument from the “just do it” concept. Savulescu says EPO should be allowed so cyclists can top up their red blood cell count, the haematocrit. After all athletes can go to altitude or use a tent so using EPO is fair too and a course of EPO is cheaper than spending weeks at altitude. If the result is the same then we should test for the health of athletes, for example checking that their blood is not too thick.

“One molecule of a growth hormone could not harm you, neither could two molecules. Finding and administering the safe dose is precisely what would be done in an open doping market.” Der Spiegel, July 2012

It’s here that Savulescu’s argument starts to crumble under the weight of pragmatism. First growth hormones are regulated medicines that come with health warnings, even normal dosages for standard use are normally reserved for those with a clinical need. So whilst a molecule of growth hormone might be ok, a vial probably is not. Savulescu seems to believe in noble athletes where “everything would take place under the supervision of physicians and only the use of substances that are considered safe would be allowed” but it’s hard to imagine this lasting in practice. Athletes break the rules to get that edge today only tomorrow we won’t be able to tell the ones taking supersize doses of EPO from the regulated ones because they cheats can say they took it under supervision. We’ve seen this already in cycling with the abuse of cortisone. Riders were allowed to use it under medical supervision to treat, say, a saddlesore or a skin rash but in fact use this therapeutic cover is exploited to use large doses on sore muscles. So even small doses of substances for reasonable health reasons will be used as cover by cheats. On another point the professor rightly points that sport is dangerous, riding downhill at speed is risky so why do we accept these risks but not the health risks via pharmaceuticals? For me it’s simple, negotiating the course is always part of the sport and an accepted skill to master. The same with an altitude training camp or even a hypoxia tent, they are legitimate as they are exogenous factors that make the body respond rather than injected molecules. More profoundly it’s culturally acceptable to practice descending than it is to spend time trying different drugs.

Geography and budget: It’s normally illegal to purchase it without a prescription so there’s the practical argument about how athletes can get hold of it; we could see cases where athletes from one country are able to buy a substance that is rejected by another nation’s pharmaceutical regulators. Therefore sports might be a question of location and access to pharmacology. Similarly just allowing  the supervised use of some medicines and practices is not so simple, it can be a question of money where being able to buy the best medical advice and products distorts the game, remember the USADA report showed that the US Postal/Discovery was outspending most other teams.

EPO, A Case Study: EPO is a useful study because if it’s not been legal in cycling, its use was widespread. Savulescu’s call to monitor the haematocrit count of athletes instead of test for EPO, to check for overall health rather than the toxicological approach of hunting banned molecules, is exactly what we saw in cycling. In the 1990s the UCI was faced with rampant use of EPO but there was no test. So an arbitrary limit was set on a rider’s haematocrit of 50%, meaning half of the blood volume was composed of red blood cells and going any higher could make the blood too thick and bring health problems. This is pretty much what Savulescu is interested in.
