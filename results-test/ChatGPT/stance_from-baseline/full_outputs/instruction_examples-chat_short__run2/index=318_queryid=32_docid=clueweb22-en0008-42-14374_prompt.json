Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

How Much Does It Cost to Purchase an Electronic Voting Machine?

General Reference (not clearly pro or con)

The State of Texas Elections Division, in testimony given by Ann McGeehan, Director of Elections, explained at the July 28, 2005 public hearing of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission:

“Each DRE costs between $2,500 and $3,500 and represents a major economic investment.”

July 28, 2005 - State of Texas Elections Division

Ellen Theisen, CEO of the Vote-PAD Company, wrote in her 2005 report “Myth Breakers: Facts About Electronic Elections”:

“Ohio has signed contracts with Election Systems and Software [ES&S], Diebold Election Systems, and Maximus/Hart Intercivic/DFM Associates to provide voting equipment for the state… In the contracts, the vendors agreed to sell their products to Ohio at the lowest prices in the nation and with the best warranty, service, and maintenance terms… The contracts call for the prices for each machine: Diebold AccuVote-TS – $2,964; ES&S iVotronics – $2,896; Hart Intercivic eSlate 3000 – $2,997…

San Diego County paid approximately $3,040 per Diebold DRE, to include a printer…

Purchasing 16,000 machines for $55.6 million, Maryland paid approximately $3,475 per Diebold DRE, not including a printer.”

The Verified Voting Foundation submitted comments on Oct. 8, 2004 to Connecticut Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz regarding the implementation of Connecticut’s HAVA State Plan, which stated:

“The average cost of a typical DRE voting machine is about $3,500 (which includes its own fold-up voting booth) and the cost of a disabled-accessible (i.e., audio-equipped) voter-verified paper ballot printer could add as much as $1,000, for a maximum combined cost of approximately $4,500 per voting station.”

The Hutchinson News ran an article on Aug. 1, 2006 titled “Rice County On Voting Edge,” in which Clara Kilbourn wrote:

“The county’s [Rice County, Kansas] 18 new electronic voting machines, purchased at a cost of $3,200 each, will be used for the first time Tuesday in the primary election.”
