Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should the voting age be lowered?

Argumentative essay – Should the voting age be lowered?

In my essay, I intend to show that lowering the voting age is not such a bad idea. My research shows that people consider lowering the voting age to be very bad. That they think terrible consequences will follow. My essay shows how this terrible consequence will not occur.

Terrible consequences? Like when women could vote?

People thought that terrible consequences would follow when women were allowed to vote. They thought a female president would follow, and yet it has never happened in America. In fact, when black people were allowed to vote, people thought it would be terrible and that a black president would soon be elected.

Younger people can be more easily manipulated

It is true that you can tap into the motivations and fears of younger people and manipulate them to do quite a bit. They have less life-experience and so are more easily manipulated.

Two terms of George Bush Jnr shows that adults can be manipulated

George Bush Jnr led the US to war in Afghanistan when Bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan. He led the US people to a war in Iraq when there were no WMDs there, and told people he would fix America when instead he got North America into 14 trillion dollars of debt. All in all, this proves that adults are just as dumb and gullible as younger people are.

People would pander to the younger crowd

How hot a person is would start to matter in elections, and things such as lowering the tax of video games would become standard political pandering.

Politicians pander to people anyway

How would pandering to teens be any different to pandering to the elderly with more Medicare or pandering to homosexuals with promises of protection from Republican hatred?

Younger people have poor judgment

Young people have less life experience and often cannot judge the true consequences of their actions, which is why they appear to have poor judgment in many matters.

There are enough adults in debt and on drugs to surmise that adults have poor judgment

How can one say that adults are decidedly more mature and that they have better judgment when they make childish and outright stupid decisions all the time? There are plenty of younger people with better judgment than adults.

Younger people do not have adult priorities

Younger people do not have the worry of mortgages, older kids, debt and a whole host of other adult problems.

Younger people have their own priorities that are only exclusive if adults couldn’t vote

Younger people do not have these problems, but they have their own. The only way a teen’s priorities would be enacted unfairly is if adults stopped voting. Lowering the voting age simply means that teen priorities are given a fairer share of consideration.

Conclusion

Every argument given for not lowering the voting age has been challenged and I feel that lowering the voting age to somewhere in the teen age-range is a good idea. I feel that my essay shows this by debunking the arguments against lowering the voting age.
