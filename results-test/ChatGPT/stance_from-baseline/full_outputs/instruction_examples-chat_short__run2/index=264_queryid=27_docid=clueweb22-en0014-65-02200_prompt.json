Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should more gun control laws be enacted?
Text: Conor J. Wisconsin

Reasons Why There Should Be Stricter Gun Control Laws

This passage is about why there should be stricter gun control laws. I will give off tons of evidence that should prove that gun control laws should be stricter.

Dear Next President, 

Guns are very dangerous objects and should not be allowed on the streets. I get it if you use a firearm to hunt or you are a policeman, but if you aren't any of those things, then why would you need a gun? Lots of deaths are caused by gun violence. According to Johns Hopkins Center For Gun Policy And Research, "more than 31,000 people a year in the United States die from gunshot wounds." Not are deaths caused by a firearm traumatic and scary, but they also cost a lot too. According to Johns Hopkins Center For Gun Policy And Research, " When lost quality of life, psychological and emotional trauma, decline in property values, and other legal and societal consequences are included, the cost of gun violence in the U.S was estimated to be about $100 billion annually in 1998." That means that we have to pay higher taxes for gun violence. If the laws were stricter about gun control, then we shouldn't have these problems. 

Gun control laws should be stricter, especially for the fault of kids. Kids are getting into their parent's/guardian's firearms, and some not so good results have came from that. Most kids don't know how to use a gun. Adam Lidgett was informed on a horrific story involving a kid with a gun from a lady named Misty Uribe. "It was a gorgeous Sunday in March when Misty Uribe's son one of his neighborhood friends accidentally get shot in the face", she said. " Uribe never thought an eight year old boy next door would find a loaded rifle in his family shed, take it outside during a cops and robbers game, and shoot a boy", she said. "Uribe's son was shaking from head to toe". Uribe did not think it was a real gun. She thought it was a nerf gun or bb gun. Uribe's son kept on saying,"no mommy, it was a real gun." Not only parents, but kids can be scarred from deadly incidents with guns. Luckily, in the incident above, the child who was shot with the loaded rifle did not end up passing away. Think of how scarred you would be if you saw one of your neighborhood friends getting shot at the age of eight. 

A lot of people who are against making gun control laws stricter will try to tell you that guns are used for self defence in mass shootings. Well, according to procon.org,"between 2007 to 2011 0.79% of victims (235,700) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of firearm." That proves that a low percentage of people actually protects themself. Also, if there were stricter gun control laws, there would be fewer suicides. According to procon.org, " between 1999 and 2013, there were 270, 237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for 52% of all suicides during those years." Both of those facts add up to one thing. Gun control laws should be stricter. 

I really hope that those three paragraphs opened your mind up about why gun control laws should be stricter. Whoever you are, Trump or Hillary, I hope you make gun control laws stricter. I get it if you are a policeman or a hunter, but if you are neither one of those, then why would you need a gun?
