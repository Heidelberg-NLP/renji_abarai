Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Higher Education Should be Free

663 words 3 page(s)

As the world economy becomes more and more driven by knowledge, obtaining a higher education has become a necessary prerequisite to reaching professional success and establishing financial security for oneself and one’s family. At the same time, however, along with demand for higher education in the professional sphere, its price has also been on the rise meaning that fewer and fewer young people from the economically disadvantaged families can afford to go to college and consequently lower their chances of building a successful career and even going up the socioeconomic ladder. Because higher education is an essential factor that allows people to move up the economic ladder and the high price of it deepens the gap between the wealthy and the poor, the government should offer free higher education for everyone which will help individual people advance and will benefit the whole society in the long run.

Higher education is the key component that allows one to build a successful career and move up the socioeconomic ladder for young people (Reed). As industries become more specialized and start looking for trained employees knowledgeable and competent in the relevant spheres, higher education becomes a key that open doors to well-paying jobs and careers that promise continuous professional development. Because it offers an opportunity to escape poverty, education is regarded as “the vehicle for closing the gap between the top and the bottom of the economic ladder” (Reed). Yet, the growing price of higher education turns it into an unattainable luxury for young people from economically disadvantaged families, thus, depriving them of an opportunity to hope for a more stable financial future even if they are determined to work hard for it.
Because higher education is such an important component of the future financial success of young people, the government should offer it for free. Although higher education is now regarded as a private commodity (Williams), it is actually more of a public good necessary to ensure that everyone has equal access to resources and opportunities.

Taking into account that current financial aid system relies mostly on loans which students have to take out without even having a guarantee that the obtained education will offer them a chance to pay them off (Govindarajan), the government should offer free education for everyone to ensure that all young people have equal chances in life.
Government-funded free education for everyone will grant all young people equal chances in succeeding in life and will benefit the whole society in the long run. Free higher education will ensure that everyone has a chance of obtaining knowledge and skills that will make them valuables employees in our increasingly knowledge-driven economy (Govindarajan). This is likely to cover the existing deficit in qualified employees in the innovative industries along with lowering the unemployment rate. Further, better educated citizens contribute to society as a whole becoming more productive, more rational, capable of making better financial decisions, less violent, and more tolerant (Williams). Hence, offering free higher education will benefit both the individual citizens and society as a whole.

Summing up, the growing price of higher education contributes to the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor as it deprives young people of the poorer families of an opportunity to build successful careers and ensure financial stability for themselves. Making higher education free will offer everyone an equal opportunity for obtaining economic well-being and will reduce the risk of young people getting into serious debt before they even start earning. In the long run, free higher education for everyone is likely to benefit individual citizens and to increase the well-being of whole society across numerous dimensions. Hence, free higher education for everyone is a real necessity for ensuring social justice and continuous economic development of our country.
