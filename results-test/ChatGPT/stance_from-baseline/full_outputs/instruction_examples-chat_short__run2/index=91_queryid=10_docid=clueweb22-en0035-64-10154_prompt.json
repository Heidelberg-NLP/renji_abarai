Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Why Vaccines Should Be Required For School Children. The

Decent Essays
Why vaccines should be required for school children The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends receiving 29 doses of vaccines as well as a yearly flu shot. But as more and more kids are getting vaccinated a number of parents start to wonder if they should be injecting their healthy kid with such substances. Vaccination is not mandatory by any U.S. federal law, but all 50 states have some kind of vaccination requirement before children enter public schools. Many that promote vaccines point to the illnesses, such as rubella, polio, smallpox, diphtheria, and whooping cough now being prevented due to vaccination. In 1980, smallpox was eradicated globally—the first so far. Polio was eliminated in 1979 in the US. Rubella in the Americas…show more content…
These finding prove that vaccinating children could yield big monetary savings for the specific families affected as well as for society as a whole. Choosing not to vaccinate one’s child could potentially affect the monetary health of the family, forcing parents to take time off work and pay for expensive medical treatments. Having a vaccinated population also brings benefits to the society as a whole. This shows that stricter vaccination laws need to be put in place by the states in order to prevent monetary loss in the future and help the overall community. Another significant reason for the need to have a vaccinated populous is to promote the health of the herd as a whole. Some people argue that the government should not be part of personal medical decisions; these people would say that since we live in a free society, we should be able to choose what we do to our bodies as well as our children’s bodies. However; having an insufficient number of the population be vaccinated leads to health risks to the society as a whole. For instance, vaccines.org states
