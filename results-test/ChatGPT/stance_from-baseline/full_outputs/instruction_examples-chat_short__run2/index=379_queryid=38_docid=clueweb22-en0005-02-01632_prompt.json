Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

A sign that say stop Education

Over time, cannabis consumers develop a weed tolerance, making the effects of marijuana diminished to a certain degree. This happens to just about anyone who consumes frequently enough. As you consume more cannabis, your brain needs more THC to produce the desired effects you seek. This is due to the diminished effects that occur when THC cannabinoids bind with the body's CB1 receptors.

However, breaks from consuming have been known to reduce one's tolerance to cannabis by making the receptors sensitive to THC once again. This is called a tolerance break, or a T-Break.

What is a Marijuana Tolerance Break?

A tolerance break refers to taking a set period of time to abstain from marijuana in order to reset the body’s sensitivity to THC and other cannabinoids. It is most often referred to as a T-break, but there are numerous slang terms for the concept, including “drug holiday” (holiday is used here in the British sense of “taking time off”).

What do we mean when we say “tolerance?” Tolerance is how strongly our bodies react to the effects of a given substance. We develop tolerances because human bodies are highly adaptive, and that includes adapting to the things we consume. As we consume cannabis, our bodies adjust to the cannabinoids over time, resulting in less potent effects. How does this happen? Let’s look at the science behind it.

Why Consider a ‘T Break’: How Marijuana Tolerance Works

While we know that our bodies develop tolerance to cannabinoids rather quickly, the scientific community still has a lot to learn about how the process happens. However, there is some information that may help us understand tolerance breaks.

In our brains we have tiny structures called cannabinoid (CB) receptors which receive and uptake cannabinoids to regulate body processes such as pain and hunger. These CB receptors are dispersed throughout the body and brain, and take in the many different types of cannabinoids to help regulate and influence our bodily processes. These include endocannabinoids, which our bodies produce naturally, and phytocannabinoids, which come from plants, and are the type we find on cannabis. Cannabis cannabinoids have nearly identical structures to some of our own natural cannabinoids, and that is why they fit into our brain and affect similar functions. However, this also likely plays into why we easily develop cannabis tolerance.

Because cannabinoids affect so many of our regular bodily functions, our bodies also have systems in place to mediate their uptake chemically. Regulating CB receptors can mean making the reaction to receptors weaker (known as desensitizing), or physically retracting (internalizing) them so that fewer cannabinoids can attach.

When our bodies intake more cannabinoids than they usually would, these systems leap into action to respond. Without regulating systems in place, we may never stop being hungry, or might never feel rested. They exist to help us maintain homeostasis. However, the same systems will react to an abundance of cannabis cannabinoids.

The more cannabinoids we throw at them, the more they will respond to mitigate them. With less available receptors and a weaker response, our bodies react less, and the effects of cannabis are reduced. Consequently, we would need to take in more cannabinoids to have the same level of effect that happened when more receptors were available. Eventually, our bodies do not respond to cannabinoids in the same way at all.

After chronic marijuana use, human brains respond to cannabis in a different way: Reward centers quit releasing dopamine after use, and the impairment in neurocognitive function goes away. This may be good for those who use marijuana regularly for chronic issues, because you can take it without issue.

How Long Should a Cannabis Tolerance Break Be?

If you are prescribed marijuana for a medical condition, consult your physician. It’s always a good idea to see a physician if you are experiencing tolerance issues. You and your physician can work out a more tailor-made plan, but for those do-it-yourselfers we will provide some helpful guidelines.

A self-imposed tolerance break can last as long as you see fit. To determine how long that should be, consider both the amount you consume and your base tolerance level.

Everyone’s interaction with cannabis is unique, and that is because each person has a unique body chemistry. Remember how we discussed CB receptors above? How these receptors perform in each person will differ depending on their genetics and the unique chemical processes that happen within them.

This means factors like a person’s levels of neurotransmitters, or the speed and effectiveness of their metabolism. As such, the duration of a tolerance break will need to be tailored to the individual in order to be most effective.

A typical duration for a tolerance break is 2-5 weeks. Casual consumers may see a tolerance reduction in as short as 1-2 weeks. For semi-frequent consumers, 2 or 3 weeks. Regular heavy consumers may need to hold out a month or longer.

Given the variance from person to person, these are soft guidelines. Overall, the more cannabis that you regularly consume, the longer your break will need to be in order to reset or reduce tolerance.

Completely ceasing cannabis consumption may not always be possible; such is the case with many medical cannabis patients who depend on daily cannabis intake to manage their symptoms. Many have found success doing partial breaks, where they scale back their cannabis intake instead of outright stoppage. This won’t be as reliable as a full-fledged break, but should still be able to help mitig
