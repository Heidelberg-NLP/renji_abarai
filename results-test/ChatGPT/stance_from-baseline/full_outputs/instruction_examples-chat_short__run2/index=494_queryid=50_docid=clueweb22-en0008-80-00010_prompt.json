Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Universal Basic Income: A Universally Bad Idea

This article is more than 3 years old.

Like a zombie, it keeps coming back. Like zombie movies, it enjoys growing popularity by defying logic and common sense.

Chicago and Stockton (CA) have launched the most recent proposals for Universal Basic Income (UBI). That the idea appeals to cities that have gone bankrupt or have unsustainable financial prospects should give us pause.

Universal Basic Income is “…a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement.” Everyone gets the same amount of cash: the homeless and the billionaire. No questions asked. Forever.

If you ask, “why do we need UBI?”, most proponents respond “because the robots will soon take all the jobs”. That is why UBI is so popular in Silicon Valley, from Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to countless start-up wizards. “And UBI is already being tested in many places” they will add.

You think about this, and then ask, “why are we testing it?”

“To make sure people will use it to learn new skills and look for a job, or set up their own business.”

In other words, we run pilot projects to make sure UBI will not stop people from looking for a job. But…

…you just told me there will be no jobs…

The technological argument for UBI is rubbish. When unsupervised robots can produce the entire U.S. GDP, by all means, let’s divide the fruits of their labor equally across the entire population. That’s easy, no need to run pilot programs. (How people will find fulfillment in that utopian world is a more troubling question.)

The reason people run UBI experiments, of course, is they do not believe for a second that the machines will do all the work. Which means that to finance UBI, enough people will have to work, produce, earn and be taxed. Hence the concern on how UBI would impact work incentives.

(By the way, these experiments consist in giving a small monthly payment to a tiny minority among the poor and unemployed, for a limited period; thus, being neither universal nor permanent they teach us nothing about how UBI would work.)

More thoughtful proponents will tell you: “we need UBI so everyone can pursue their passion. If you are guaranteed enough to live with dignity, you can take a risk, become an entrepreneur or an artist.”

This sounds almost reasonable, but it clashes with two unpleasant truths:

First: since we need human work to improve our lot, the priority is to make sure everyone contributes to the best of their abilities;

Second: these abilities are very unequally distributed. Not everyone has a passion, and not everyone is equally talented. This is a simple fact of life.

Not everyone can be an entrepreneur or an artist. Our economies need construction workers, welders, plumbers, electricians, nurses, firemen, policemen, janitors, waiters. Some people go into some of these jobs with passion, others because it pays the bills—and these jobs need to be done.

We already have a shortage of skills in a number of industries. In oil and gas, mining, shipping and a host of other sectors sizable cohorts of experienced workers are about to retire with no pipeline of younger workers to take their place. This is hardly the time to send young people the message that they should follow their (as yet unidentified) passion and not worry about job prospects.

UBI would send exactly that wrong-headed message, reducing people’s incentive to work. And it would get worse. Our concept of a dignified life is relative. Getting by on my guaranteed basic income, I will look at my richer, working peers and feel that my lifestyle is not quite dignified. So I will lobby politicians for an increase in UBI. As UBI rises, even fewer people will work; those who still work will have to be taxed more, and so even fewer people will work, and…

If you doubt these arguments, consider that advanced economies are already littered with young people with college degrees no employer considers useful—while ancient Greek literature may be a passion, it does not guarantee a job and a living wage.

The countries toying with the idea of UBI—all advanced economies—are deep in debt, with pitifully low productivity growth and a massive looming rise in pension and health care expenditures (think of Italy, where the populist Five Stars movement secured one-third of the vote in the last elections by promising UBI). They desperately need to generate more income and spend it wisely—it makes no sense to waste money on those who do not need it.

Rich societies have a moral obligation to fight poverty and homelessness. To help when you fall on hard times because of health problems or because you lost your job. They have an obligation—and an interest—to broaden access to opportunity, so that your chances of success depend more on how talented and hard-working you are, less on your family circumstances (recognizing that we can never completely level the playing field).

This means a strong and targeted social safety net. The building blocks are familiar: unemployment benefits, health care for the poor, scholarships for bright low-income students.

Social safety nets need to be improved, and it is devilishly hard to strike the right balance between assistance and incentives, to combine strong incentives to work with the assurance that if you lose your job you will still be ok.

Devilishly hard, but that is the problem we need to solve—not how to divide up money that we don’t have. UBI is like granting open-ended unemployment benefits with no requirement to look for work, or financing an indefinite ‘gap year’ to anyone who wants it. It would be nice. We just don’t have the money.

Silicon Valley’s role in the UBI debate is especially irresponsible. San Francisco makes headlines for its tent cities of homeless people, drug needles and human feces in the streets, and rising crime rates. These are hard problems to solve; most tech companies prefer to parade a hubristic concern that their technologies will automate all jobs—all while the unemployment rate in San Francisco County is a mere 2.6%.

Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes’ Economic Security Project contributed $1 million to nearly fully fund Stockton’s 1-year UBI experiment. That’s headline-grabbing charity. If you truly believe there will be no more jobs, you should set up a perpetual endowment to help fund UBI. If you think people need help finding their career path, you could give them jobs or education and training opportunities.

Silicon Valley can help foster learning, skilling and reskilling, both with funding and by developing new technologies. Those working in this direction are part of the solution; those grandstanding on UBI are part of the problem.
