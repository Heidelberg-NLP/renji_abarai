Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should net neutrality be restored?
Text: Why are Republicans largely against net neutrality? - Quora

Some people (most of whom are often identified with a capital D in parens after their surname) just absolutely hate to see something so Big and so much a part of our economy go Free. It should be Regulated and Taxed and Controlled by people in Washington, not, again, because there is some big Problem that requires the attention of Government, but simply because it's so very Big. It affects the daily (well, I should make up a word like "minutely" for myself and many others) life of almost all of us, and is the tool we use to make and spend money. It makes some people just burst into tears that it is not Regulated and Taxed and Controlled.

The argument goes that, because the companies that provide our access to the internet are profit-making, they will undoubtedly decide some day to bow to unseen and unknown Evil Forces, and screw all their customers. To prevent that, we must build a Great Marble Edifice (or perhaps sign a thirty year lease on an existing one in downtown Washington, DC), hire many thousands of smart people, and pay them all six figure salaries (along with great health care and retirement benefits) so they can make sure this doesn't happen.

This is exactly what Republicans cannot stand. This is regulation that is simply not needed. It is regulating (think of synonyms like "controlling" and "overseeing" and "policing" and "babysitting") the economy rather than enforcing the law. Like all Republicans, I like the law. I like enforcement. I don't oppose any law that would prevent a company from selling service guaranteed to provide a particular bandwidth and then purposely defrauding their customer. This is exactly like being in favor of laws that make it illegal to dump toxins into the air or water. But too often, regulatory mechanisms serve as schemes for full employment for civil servants, and do nothing to protect consumers.

I don't want to abolish the FCC. (Note that the Chair doesn't agree with the President of the United States on Net Neutrality.) Some regulation of our air, water, airwaves, and utilities is appropriate. But it should be the least that is needed, not the most we can dream up. Let's first not get Congress involved, if we can help it, because it will just get them invited to a thousand fundraisers and cause them to have ten thousand meetings with lobbyists, and secondly, let's let something that is working unbelievably well keep working. The Commission can handle any emerging problems quietly and quickly and then stay out of the way.

If you favor Net Neutrality, please explain why we need it. If your answer is along the lines of "Big Companies are Evil and must be Regulated, or they might do something Bad", I will smile, thank you, and go on about my Business.

Republicans aren’t against “net neutrality”. They are against unnecessary regulations. The Internet has been largely unregulated and there have not been any appreciable issues related to net neutrality. Those few times when something came up, such when an ISP was throttling the service of a competitive VoIP provider, have been handled without the need for more regulations.

Under the Obama administration, they passed Net Neutrality rules by reclassifying broadband as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Section 706). So

Under the Obama administration, they passed Net Neutrality rules by reclassifying broadband as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Section 706). So, these rules were based on legislation from an Act that was passed well before the Internet, and part of another from a time when Internet access was primarily through dial-up modems. They were overreaching, and allowed for the possibility of even more stringent controls that were not needed.

Republicans tend to avoid regulations if they are not needed because it makes it harder for businesses to prosper. They prefer the free market take care of issues when possible, and to enact limited regulations when they become necessary.

The free market has survived a government that watches the water pipes, the utilities, the sewage lines, the phone system, the radio waves, the sky, our food, the roads, the police and fireman, etc, and having a government protecting consumer interests on the internet will be survivable as well. But they'd much prefer to be able to control their own internets, so that they can choose what and who is heard, and make people pay for the privilege of going anywhere on their lines. Remember cable?

This is what it could eventually become.

If that happened, congressmen stand to make even more money, so its a win win.

UPDATE: In light of Gary Teal's valid point, its an oversimplification to say that any congress critter would take any position when the proper amount of money is allocated to their re-election fund. Each side definitely has standard positions based on their party's stance on each issue (though BlueDog dems swing more than a 70's key party.) Democrats like healthcare and lawyers and oversight (real Democrats, the fake ones like banks too.), the GOP likes drowning goverment in the bathtub, and freedom™, as long as they aren't gay or woman freedom. Also yay guns.

From their base position, what really determines how the policy goes is what monied interests do the best lobbying. Often bills are written completely based on lobbyist findings (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, there are good lobbyists out there, its just the vast majority are paid by powerful interests that don't represent American citizens.)

So the answer is that the GOP feels that any oversight is too much, that the free market should determine the outcome. And the corporations with the most vested interest in profit over individuals have given them the added incentive of $6,000,000 in donations to make sure they vote the right way.

Basically because it gives government some control over the internet. Even if the government claims it is only doing so to protect consumers, most Republicans feel the internet is a place the government has no business regulating any aspect of.

Because it imposes government regulation and solves a problem that only exists in the fiction created by the Democrats.

Because we know that unintended consequences lurk behind each new regulation. Thus, we want to be thoroughly convinced that such regulations are actually necessary before supporting them. There is not currently any such urgency for net neutrality. If that changes, there is nothing preventing us from passing net neutrality laws in the future.
