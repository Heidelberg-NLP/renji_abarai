Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Well, let’s do some math, 1.7 megawatts in a barrel of oil. World uses 100,000,000 barrels a day. Which comes to about 7,100,000 megawatts per hour. Next, At 6 megawatts per wind turbine, you will need 3 to make 6 megawatts per hour 24 hours a day to make up for no wind times. Then another 15% off line for maintenance. Which comes to about 4,000,000 wind turbines. This means we would have to install about 550 turbines everyday and never stop. Or 800 per working day. They only have a life of about 20 years.

This of course assumes no increase in energy consumption. Now our energy consumption from natural gas and coal are about the same. So triple all the numbers. Now if energy usage goes up at about 3.5% per year. This is a low number. Than in 20 years we would need to double again these numbers. So this comes to 4,800 wind turbines installed every working day and never stop. 1,200,000 per year. Then we need transformers, kilometres of cabling, substations, batteries, and more. The short answer is no. Fun fact all the installed solar in the world does not produce enough electricity to power the internet. Soon world population will need desalination plants for fresh water, and lots of them. Much more electricity.

Wind by definition is an unstable source of energy with capacity factors averaging 40%. Roughly speaking, this means wind mills can generate only 40% of the total energy they would produce with constant full wind.

So, wind energy, as well as solar, requires a backup energy that can start when wind stop blowing (or after sunset in solar). This energy is usually provided by fossil-fuel power plants as they are relatively easy to switch on and off as required.

The only way those temporal energies can replace fossil fuels is using batteries (or other technology) to store enough energy to cover energ

The only way those temporal energies can replace fossil fuels is using batteries (or other technology) to store enough energy to cover energy demand when wind mills stop (60% of time). If the technology gets good and, very important, cheap enough then they can perfectly replace fossil fuels. This is the main challenge nowadays to have perfectly clean energy available permanently.

In some regions of the globe that may be possible, but probably not worldwide. But we don’t need that either, because solar energy resources are much more widespread and they are not in any way mutually exclusive.

In price solar electricity is now roughly equivalent to wind power, but that may not stay that way.

as there is always a wind blowing somewhere , wind and solar power will eliminate the need for fossil fuels much to the dismay of the fossil fuel supporters

No but it it wasn't for Fossil Fuels, Wind Energy could not exist at all as FF provides all the storage and backup for the 50% of the time that the wind dont blow..

For electricity generation, yes. And it’s coming soon. Already happened in Europe in 2020.

“…despite the pandemic, renewable energy accounted for 90% of new electricity generation. In the next five years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects renewable sources to overtake fossil fuels as the world’s dominant form of electricity generation.”

The Rise and Future of Offshore Wind Farms
Offshore wind may be the answer to achieving a carbon neutral world. Here’s a look at the rise, potential, and future of the offshore wind industry.

We just installed solar PV - and in the 5 days we have had it we have generated more electricity than we have used in total.

So we are selling quite a bit of electricity to the grid.

We could choose to go 100% renewables on the part that is not coming from our solar panels, by choosing the green energy option which requires the provider to source the quantity of energy we use from renewables.

We could choose to install a battery to make the excess solar PV from the daytime useable at night - this is not the time to do it - but in the next 5 yea

Coal is no longer economic here.

One state has eliminated it and reduced the amount of gas they are using as well, and yes it is solar & wind that have replaced the capacity. Their power generation prices have dropped and they are now the cheapest generation price in the country.

Rooftop PV solar is a large part of their shift. That is home owners and businesses with Solar panels.

Another state uses no coal and runs mostly on hydro.

My state is dragging the chain and still using lots of coal for the grid generation.

You will find that Rooftop PV is pushing the process by removing daytime demand for generation at utility scale and it’s not being hamstrung by bad energy policy from federal governments.

Although it is possible to shift 100% in that time, the government policy is getting in the way by making investment uncertain.

15 years is a more reasonable time.

Even in my state which is really being held back the CO2 intensity has gone from 1.04 kg/kWh to about 680 kg/kWh.

If we have eliminated about 30% of the CO2 in about 5 years we can do a lot more in the next 10–15 years.

The technologies to transition are now not only available but cost effective for the current needs in making the shift. It is in fact possible to reduce the expenses by implementing them.

Then in the next few years the prices will drop on the storage technologies even further and deploying more storage will also be a cost benefit.

This transition is achievable at a lower cost than not doing it.

As with the renewables themselves, it is not useful to ask for one single solution. The important way to approach all this is diversity. A wide range of renewables is essential, as is a wide range of storage solutions, including pumped hydro, battery, pressurised salt caverns, fuel cell technology, and many others.

Are you asking about Wind Turbines?

Yes, they always produce more energy than it took to make them. It only takes a few months for them to produce that amount of electricity, in fact. Say another month to cover installation expenses. Less than a year in anycase.

What you should be looking into is this: How much energy, petrochemical based fertilizer, labor, and transportation /processing does it take to make one gallon of corn ethanol? And don’t forget to factor in the corn subsidies for farmers too, and the processing plants might get some federal subsidies on top of that!

When it takes as much

When it takes as much oil to dig up and process tar sands into an equal amount of something useable, then you are spending to much energy on the process.

Now in month 4,5, or 6, your Wind Turbine is making virtually free electricity. Apart from lubricants, and occasional maintenance, you are home free.

Electrical power lines are rather ubiquitous, and moving energy through them is relatively efficient, so yes.

Yes, green energy can replace fossil fuels, but there is a big challenge: renewables suffer interruptions in a daily basis.
