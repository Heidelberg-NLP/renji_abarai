Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

How Can Illegal Immigrants Become Citizens in Canada?

HomeVisas & PRHow Can Illegal Immigrants Become Citizens in Canada?

Elsewhere, much has been said about the problems with illegal immigration. The number of illegal immigrants in Canada is rising. So, the Canadian government has been doing everything to keep the figures down.

Right now, the government of Canada is considering solutions left and right. Some of the suggested solutions are harsh and aggressive. These include stricter border controls. Within the country, the government is trying to identify illegal immigrants. But, despite being successful, this has been difficult, according to some authorities.

Many of these solutions indeed do one thing. They try to remove illegal immigrants from the country.

Yet, it has its values and a desire for more skilled and unskilled workers. Because of this, Canada has created ways to gain citizenship. This allows immigrants to be part of the Canadian population.

This is a positive thing. For, illegal immigrants (or immigrants with no legal status) face problems in Canada.

The Problems of Illegal Immigrants in Canada

Illegal immigrants often find themselves in difficult circumstances in Canada.

Undocumented, most of them are afraid. They live with the fear of being found and deported back to their home countries. As a result, life for them in Canada is not secure.

And, many of them are unable to access healthcare services. To get a health card in any province in Canada, residents need to present documents that show their identity and status. Illegal immigrants lack legal status and these documents. So, they are not eligible for this privilege unless they are willing to pay for it.

The lack of documentation and legal status also prevents most of them from working. Undocumented immigrants could work odd jobs. But, many employers will usually be hesitant to employ them. Employing illegal immigrants is illegal. This could make the employer liable and face penalties. Getting a job may be possible for an illegal immigrant. Nonetheless, the chances are very low.

They also face the contempt of some members of their community. Many Canadians are very vocal about how they feel about them. Canadian citizens and Canadian residents simply view illegal immigrants as “people who they should not share Canada with”. This leads to conflicts.

So, the higher quality of life for an illegal immigrant in Canada does come with many problems.

And, going through the legal path to citizenship removes all of these.

How Illegal Immigrants Could Be Canadian Citizens

The proper way for illegal immigrants to gain citizenship involves three steps. They must first earn a temporary work permit. After working and staying in Canada, they could apply for permanent residence. The permanent residency would make an immigrant eligible for citizenship.

This is important to understand. Getting a permanent resident status with a tourist visa is impossible. But, it is possible to get a work permit with such a visa.

Step 1: Applying and Getting a (Temporary) Work Permit

The first step is to apply for a temporary work permit. Though temporary, it would allow an immigrant to get work legally in Canada. After all, the most important goal for any immigrant is the first (legal) job.

There is a paper-based way to apply for this. And, there is also an online option. Right now, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) recommends applying online.

An immigrant must create an online account.

CIC can inform applicants about the progress of their application through this account. Any supporting documents would be helpful. The applicant must submit copies of these online as well.

There are three benefits to doing this.

First, it is much quicker to get a response compared to the paper-based way. Online, it is possible to receive notifications and track progress much faster.

It also ensures something else. It ensures the completion of documents. Incomplete applications are immediately returned to the applicant. So, every successful application must have been complete.

Lastly, applying online is free. There is no need to pay for a courier.

Once the application is successful, applicants must provide biometrics and a photo for ID. Applicants need to pay for this. For biometrics, CIC requires the fingerprints. Applicants will have 30 days to do this.

Once receiving his or her work permit, an applicant will be eligible to work for an employer.

Step 2: Permanent Residence

At this point, an applicant will have worked for an employer for at least a year. This is required to apply for permanent residence. This is a crucial step for many. For, permanent residence is a need for Canadian citizenship.

An applicant could apply for one of three programs for permanent residence in Canada

Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)

Under this program, the employer of the applicant must offer him or her permanent employment. The application of an immigrant depends on this offer. Also, applications follow a point-based system. Scores are given to an applicant. The scores depend on the applicant meeting certain criteria. The criteria include age, language skills, and occupation.

Applying through this program takes 12 to 18 months.

Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)

An immigrant could apply for this within a year of being in Canada. An employer must nominate the applicant for this.

To qualify for residence under this program, an immigrant must be highly-skilled. So, for some people, this is not the most popular choice.

Canadian Experienced Class

For both temporary workers and students, this is the most common option.

An applicant must do one of two things to qualify for citizenship.

An applicant under this program must work in Canada for no less than two years. Or, an applicant must complete a year of college or university studies with one year of work experience.

Step 3: Applying for Citizenship

Getting citizenship after being a permanent resident is naturalization. And, permanent residents are eligible for naturalization if they meet certain requirements.

The youngest age for an applicant is 18 years. But, naturalization is also possible for children. The parents or legal guardians must apply on their behalf. Also, children need to be permanent residents.

Besides this, the applicant must have been a permanent resident in Canada for 3 years. However, for children, this is not necessary.

All applicants for Canadian citizenship must also show language skills. They must prove their ability to use either French or English. They must also prove that they can understand sentences in these languages. In short, there will be language tests in either French or English. 

Citizenship cannot be granted to applicants with a criminal history. Applicants should not be under investigation. Nor could they be in prison at the time of application. Also, they should not have committed a crime within three years of the application.

Finally, an immigrant must show an understanding of Canada’s history, values, institutions, symbols, rights, and responsibilities. There is a paper-based test for this. And, applicants must do well.

After an applicant undergoes the entire process, he or she will become a citizen of Canada.

Final Word: Stay Legally Or Don’t Stay At All

It is true.

Canada is everything anyone would want in a country. Its laws safeguard the welfare and rights of all within its borders. And, it ensures a high quality of life for the people.

Without the help of immigrants, Canada would not be the country it is today. But, these immigrants went through the legal process on the way to permanent residence and citizenship. To stay in the country without doing the same would be unfair to them. Thus, choose to be in Canada legally, and it will welcome you with open arms.
