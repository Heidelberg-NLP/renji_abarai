Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should students have to wear school uniforms?
Text: Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?

I read the article “Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?  I was about a debate between two sides.  The pro school uniforms and against school uniforms.  The pro school uniforms say, “School uniforms make schools safer for students. They say that uniforms create a “level playing field.” Students who wear uniforms are less worried about who has the nicest clothes. So they pay more attention to their schoolwork.”  Against school uniforms say, “Kids express themselves through their clothes. They argue that making them wear uniforms limits this freedom. They also say that uniforms don’t make students behave better or do better in school. Uniforms don’t hide the differences between rich and poor students, they argue. In fact, uniforms actually make them worse.”  Which side would you be on?  I think that I would be on against school uniforms.  I think that school uniforms ruin the fun of expressing yourself through clothes.  I am noticing how some children get in trouble just because they refuse to wear the school uniform.  I think that is unfair.  All they want to do is wear their own clothes and they get in trouble.  What do you think about this situation and how do you think people could solve it?

  1. Great Job 🙂 I think kids should not wear uniforms. I used to wear a uniform in kindergarten at my old school. It was not fun.

  4. well I think school uniforms are necessary for the students because they’ll look more smarter in school uniforms and it’s shows identity to the schools as well.
