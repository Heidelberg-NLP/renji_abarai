Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Space Exploration Should Not be Privatized


PRO (4 arguments)

1. Private space organizations are businesses, and are therefore much more profit oriented than government organizations. They will travel in space for the good of their companies, not the people.
Warrant:

Right now, Satellites in space can do hundreds of jobs we cannot do from Earth. They transmit TV and phone signals, control satellite navigation systems, and study oceans, pollution, the atmosphere, and a lot of other things we cannot see on Earth. These satellites have helped us with everything from pollution to studying ice sheets. They can even predict the weather. This is because government funded organizations care about making these advancements and helping the people. However, if space exploration were to become completely privatized, these private organizations would be much more focused on making profits.  Businesses exist to make profits, and so private organizations would not send satellites into space for the good of the people. Clearly, NASA, a government funded organization, has done a lot of things for the good of the people. The list off NASA spin-off inventions, inventions created because of NASA tools and replacements for normal products, goes on and on. The list includes everything from satellite TV to dustbusters to lighter breathing apparatus for firefighters. NASA also helps study pollution, oceans, and more to make the world a better place. So much technology is here because of things NASA did in space. When we compare this to private companies, we can see a difference. SpaceX, a private company, had a revenue of about 1 billion in 2014. SpaceX, like other businesses, will continue to make a profit in order to continue functioning. When a business ceases to make revenue, they are forced to close down. If we are given a choice between government organizations like NASA that are helping people, and private, profit focused organizations, we should clearly choose government organizations.

Impact:

If it weren’t for government funded organizations, space travel would not be nearly as beneficial to the overall people. NASA, a government funded space program, has been greatly beneficial to the US and privatizing space exploration would stop this. Clearly, NASA and government funded space organizations are better for the government, the economy, and technology so we should not privatize space exploration and turn space into a business.

2. Having a privatized space system is less safe.
Warrant:

Since privatized companies do not hold any responsibility to the government, they may not be held accountable for any mishaps. For instance, while the Challenger and Columbia disasters affected NASA’s operations (including an over two year hiatus from launching shuttles), it did not halt the space program. By comparison, private companies actually have a far more difficult set of issues to face in the case of a mishap. In a worst case scenario, a private company could make an easy scapegoat if ever a government’s legitimacy were to be threatened due to a mishap. Private companies have yet to amass significant casualties, with the only death occurring during a failed Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014. But because that flight was not part of a mission to the International Space Station and was not tied to any government contract, the implications were different. If an astronaut from NASA were killed in a launch orchestrated by a private company, there may be far-reaching effects both for NASA and for the company in question.

Impact:

The impact of having an unsafe way of space travel is that more people are unsafe in space and will die, while private companies suffer more financial losses and fatalities that ruin them and their reputations. Although it is important to keep the space program going, NASA only uses 3.6 billion out of its 18.4 billion dollar budget, and taxpayers money that goes to space travel is 0.5% which means in the future it does have the capability to create better rockets.

3. NASA and other government organizations have higher success rates and more experience in space, therefore they are better at exploring space.
Warrant:

NASA was founded in 1958, long before any private companies. To give some examples, SpaceX was founded in 2002, and Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004. NASA has almost 50 years of experience these companies have not had, which is very important when it comes to space exploration. That is 44 years of launching spacecrafts, both successful and unsuccessful, making mistakes, and making discoveries. This experience means that NASA is better at launching rockets, dealing with mistakes, and building innovative rockets and     supplies. If we were to privatize space exploration, we would lose NASA and the experience they have, and, to a certain extent, have to start over in space.  

NASA has launched over 200 crewed missions, and many more without humans aboard. Most of these missions have been successful, as NASA currently has a 98 percent successful launch rate. To compare, SpaceX has only had 31 Falcon 9 launches, none of which were crewed, with a 94% success rate. Clearly, NASA has done better in space because they have the experience, skill, and success that private companies do not have.

Impact:

Right now, NASA is by far better at exploring space than any private company. There is no need to privatize spacer exploration completely, because that would get rid of NASA, a leading organization in space exploration.

4. Space X is run by a businessman who could have trouble with Space X if investors pull out.
Warrant:

With Nasa getting constant funding because of taxes they are able to work constantly without budget constraints depending on how much they get from taxes. But SpaceX and other private space programs are funded by investors which could drop out at any time and stop the funding of these programs. This could be extremely detrimental to these companies making it so they will have to cut corners the make cheaper rockets which could be dangerous. As of 2015 SpaceX has an evaluation of 12 billion dollars while Nasa has an budget of 19.4 billion dollars. Judge, This is a catastrophic difference between funding and I would like to remind you that SpaceX could lose almost all its funding from investors tomorrow or the next day. Now you may be wondering why having small funding is bad well many SpaceX ships have crashed in the past so smaller funding will make it even easier to crash and have other issues. Less funding means less workers less material and less safe. Also SpaceX doesn’t even have as much funding than NASA making NASA better because they can spend more money to get better workers and materials.

Impact:

In the end Space X does not have a lot of funding compared to NASA. Also the funders for SpaceX can pull out at any time taking all the money away from SpaceX making it unreliable and making the space ships more dangerous because of cut funding to workers and quality materials.


CON (3 arguments)

1. Private companies are more efficient in cost and time.
Warrant:

Private companies such as SpaceX have made more progress in the last decade than NASA has since the Moon Landing in 1962. SpaceX has sent rockets to space and brought them back to reuse them again, making a more efficient and cheaper space exploration as they don’t need to pay for new rockets.  This, costs less and takes less time than NASA rockets. 

A 2011 study conducted by NASA itself, shows that the Falcon 9 rocket launched by SpaceX would have cost much more had it been developed within the confines and culture of NASA. NASA personnel visited SpaceX to learn more about the company's rockets and found that more hardware was either off-the-shelf or derived from the smaller Falcon 1 rocket which made the cost savings through commercialization incredibly dramatic. There was a giant disparity between the privatized model costing $443 million, and the NASA way of doing things costing $1.4 billion. So the smaller, nimbler SpaceX has the demonstrated ability to produce rockets more quickly and cheaply than NASA does. That is no great surprise—NASA is hardly a model of entrepreneurial efficiency.

Furthermore, SpaceX sends rockets to space more frequently than NASA and has strict enough safety procedures to not crash a ship once in space.

Impact:

We need space exploration to move faster. We can’t wait for things like global warming to grow into an even larger problem and we have no alternative planet for human life. If global warming continues we are going to need a new place to live. Judge, with privatized space exploration we can move faster to achieve this goal.

2. The US should not be spending money on NASA. Private companies taking over space exploration would allow us to use the money for other projects.
