Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Is vaping with e-cigarettes safe?
Text: Many now see vaping as a good alternative to smoking. But is it the safer option? Does vaping have any harmful effects? Here’s what you need to know.

Vape vs. Cigarettes

Through the years, the tobacco industry has been trying to find ways to make cigarette smoking less dangerous. However, most of these efforts, such as added filters or “light cigarettes” were merely just marketing tactics. Smoking has not become any less harmful, so smokers are looking for alternatives.

One such alternative is vaping, which uses e-cigarettes to vaporize liquids within a cartridge and produce an inhalable aerosol (hence the term, vaping). Compared to traditional cigarettes that burn tobacco to produce smoke, vaping doesn’t use combustion, which means there are fewer chemicals and carcinogens that get formed and inhaled into the body.

Is Vape Safe?

According to a recent study, vaping is better than smoking and it can help smokers quit. When people inhale cigarette smoke, they’re taking nicotine and other burnt chemicals into their lungs and those chemicals enter the bloodstream and spread through your body.

With vaping, instead of burning tobacco leaves to release nicotine, vapes (or e-cigarettes) use batteries to heat the nicotine-containing liquid to an aerosol. As such, levels of these toxicants are fewer with vaping.

Vaping Health Effects

While vaping is generally safer and a better option compared to cigarettes, this doesn’t mean that there are no vape health risks.

People who are into dual-use -- smoking and vaping, are at a higher risk. There’s also a growing number of younger people (particularly adolescents) who are getting into vaping.
