Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should bottled water be banned?
Text: Should Plastic Bottles Be Banned? – Miles Away

Miles Away

An effort to help the environment

Should Plastic Bottles Be Banned?

Have you ever gone to a park on a hot day and brought some bottled water? Most of us have. Some feel like using bottled water is safer and more convenient. Others believe that bottled water is harming our environment. Some also believe that plastic bottles are actually not good for you because of the plastic. This debate has been going on for a while and let’s try and understand both sides of the argument.

The pros: 

  • Bottled water is safer than using a glass or a reusable water bottle 

When you use a plastic bottle of water you’re drinking from something no one else has used before, therefore reducing the risk of germs. 

  • It tastes better than tap water 

Bottled water tends to taste better than water that comes from a tap. 

  • Plastic bottles aren’t 100% of the plastic in the ocean and on beaches 

Banning bottled water would reduce some amounts of plastic from the ocean, but there are still plastic bags, containers, and other things that litter the ocean. 

  • It’s more convenient than reusable bottles 

Plastic bottles are easier to just grab and go, instead of having to take the time to fill up reusable bottles. 

  • Plastic bottles are more accessible and less expensive than something reusable 

You can get lots of water bottles by just buying a whole pack of them, but to buy just 2 reusable bottles is more expensive. 

These are good reasons to keep plastic bottles, but here are the reasons why we should ban plastic bottles. In my opinion, I agree with this side of the argument. 

The cons: 

  • Plastic bottles are hurting animals 

Animals can see the bottles as food, and they eat it, which kills them. Without animals, their ecosystems can collapse. 

  • The production of plastic bottles releases emissions and can hurt the environment 

When plastic bottles are made, the production of them in factories produces smoke and emissions and harms the environment. It also can enlarge the hole in the ozone layer.  

  • Plastic bottles have chemicals in them. It’s therefore dangerous to drink water out of these bottles, right?

Because of the chemicals in the plastic, it can be unsafe to drink from because the chemicals can leach out of the bottle 1

  • Along with the actual plastic bottles, they’re usually wrapped in even more plastic 2

Plastic bottles not only come with their own plastic – but also with more unnecessary plastic that will never be used again after the bottles are used. 

  • Tap water can increase your opposition to certain bacteria 3

Drinking tap water can increase your resistance to certain types of bacteria. 

In my opinion, we should ban plastic bottles. They are harming animals when they are thrown into the ocean and on land, and are increasing emissions when they are made. 

Some towns and places even have banned plastic bottles like Kenya, 4 the UK, 5 and many towns in Cape Cod. Your town can, too! We need to work together to ban plastic bottles as a step closer to saving the environment.

  1. Great review Julia! I also think that reusable bottles are better! Some other ideas to think about:
    1) I think reusable bottles are actually cheaper in the long run.
    2) When you buy plastic water bottles in bulk they take up a lot of room in your house.
    3) Reusable bottles that are insulated keep your water cold.
    4) You can try a water filtration system, like Brita, to improve the taste of tap water. That’s what we do!

  2. Thank you so much for the feedback, Maria! I’ll be sure to keep those things in mind.
