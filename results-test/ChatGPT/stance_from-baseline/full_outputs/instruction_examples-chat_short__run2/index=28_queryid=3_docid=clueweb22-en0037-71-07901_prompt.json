con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Text: Pelosi Defends Members of Congress Trading Stocks: It’s a ‘Free Market’

1333 comments

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Wednesday she believed members of Congress should be allowed to trade stocks despite ethical questions, citing the “free market.”

Pelosi, who routinely makes headlines with her husband for their prophetic ability to making winning trades, made the comment in response to a reporter who asked about a Business Insider story based on a five-month review that found a large number of lawmakers and their staffers had been late filing financial disclosures detailing their trades. “Should members of Congress and their spouses be banned from trading individual stocks while serving in Congress?” the reporter asked.

“No,” Pelosi replied. “We have a responsibility to report on the stock, but I’m not familiar with that five-month review. But if people aren’t reporting, they should be.”

The reporter persisted amid muffled crosstalk after Pelosi finished, prompting her to add, “Because this is a free market. We’re a free-market economy. They should be able to participate in that.”

Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, both 81, most recently made news for their trading activity in January, when they purchased between $500,000 and $1 million in call options in Tesla stock at a strike price of $500.The stock hit a new historical high last month in excess of $1,200. And last year, by one estimate, the couple made a 45.59 percent return on stocks, along with a 66.7 percent return on options trading.

Pelosi was worth $115 million in 2020, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, up from $41 million in 2004. She was first elected to Congress in 1987, when members received a salary of $89,500, and first elected speaker in 2007. She presently draws a salary of $223,500 from that position.

Business Insider’s Wednesday report found 49 members of Congress, along with 182 Capitol Hill staffers, who were late to submit disclosures about their trades in 2020 and 2021, which are required under the STOCK Act. They face a $200 fine for first offenses under the law, an amount that can increase over time. However, congressional ethics staff refused to confirm whether any of the rogue traders had been fined.
