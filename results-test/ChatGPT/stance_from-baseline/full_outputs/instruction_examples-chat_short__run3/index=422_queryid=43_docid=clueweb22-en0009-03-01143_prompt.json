Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Bottled Water Be Banned in Schools?

It's estimated that 30 billion single-serving bottles of water are gulped down each year in the United State.  Some people think that bottled water is good however some people know that bottled water is just purified tap water.  I think bottled water should be banned in schools. 


There are many reasons why bottled water should be banned.  One reason why bottled water should be banned is from knowing that 25% of bottled water is tap.  In the CNN video, Most Bottled Water is Tap, one lady said that she was bamboozled and hoodwinked.  Another lady said that she would never drink Aquafina after realizing that Aquafina doesn't come from a spring or reservoir like the brand name says.  Another reason why bottled should be banned is because it is bad for the environment.  The Mayor from California said in an article Goodbye, Bottled Water “More than one billion plastic water bottles end up in California’s landfill each year, taking 100 years to biodegrade and leaking toxic additives such as phthalates into the groundwater.”  This quote is showing that plastic water bottles don’t biodegrade as easily.  Tap water doesn't biodegrade at all.  The final reason why bottled water should be banned is because some bottled water is expensive.  Brands like Fuji cost 8 dollars or more in hotels.


On the other hand, some people think that bottled water shouldn’t be banned in schools.  One reason why people think that bottled water shouldn't be banned in schools is because we should have an opinion whether to drink bottled water or tap.  By banning bottled water, it takes away the option to choose their choice of beverage. However, bottled water is too expensive to drink. Most of  the bottled water is tap and takes 1,000 years to biodegrade. Bottled water also leaks toxic additives into the groundwater, which is where people get their tap water from.


As you can see bottled water should be banned in schools.  Bottled water is bad for the environment, expensive and really just glorified tap water.  In fact, Martha Coakley already banned bottled water in Concord Massachusetts. We need your help to make sure that bottled water is banned from schools.

Bs. Bottled water is for the convenience of having water on the go. Like "going" to school. It should be allowed everywhere. The author of this was paid to write this, or was just brainwashed into stupid ways of thinking.
