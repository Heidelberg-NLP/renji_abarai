pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

He doesn’t have the power to levy any tax without Congressional approval. Besides that’s obviously unconstitutional just like a poll tax. But perhaps we should levy a $5000 tax on stupid questions.

Constitutionally speaking…. It’s blatantly unconstitutional to tax a right. Much like you can’t tax the right of free speech, you can’t tax the right to keep and bear arms. While a firearm might be taxed as a good or product, if there was a separate tax on it then it would be challenged in court. And if that court were true to the Constitution, and took their oath seriously, it would be struck down as blatantly illegal.

It would be a very difficult thing to due because he doesn’t have the power to tax. Something that would require an act of congress to do. Anything on his end would ultimately work it’s way up through the federal courts/SCOTUS before it is decided. But much like the individual mandate for Obamacare, the judges may take a very liberal approach.

With solid, actionable data, you can double down on the efforts that are working well & cut what's not.

Wow…That just made my .38 Spl S&W revolver worth $10,000 when he tries to buy it back from me…Plus tax of course…I’ll only accept silver and gold as payment…And I’ll value the silver at $10/oz and the gold at $500/oz…

IF biden and president harris can pass that pesky background check…Which she has admitted she can’t…

Doubtful that he could. Even in the unlikely event that that passes as a law, it would be fought to the Supreme Court who would likely vote it to be unconstitutional.

Same thing if he went by Executive Order. A relevant case would be found, and the. case would end up at the Supreme Court. Same outcome as above.

What rational person could possibly conclude that protecting one’s right to life is a bad thing?

Take a look at the answer of someone from Australia. They have a problem with someone defending themselves against someone who is a direct threat to their life. Yet they have no issue with killing an unborn child. Go figure that one out. All the more confusing when you see this person who opposes killing people in self defense was in the military.

This innovative search engine reveals so much. Type in your name, wait 107 seconds, brace yourself.

The same way he could implement a $3000 poll tax for votes cast (state or Federal). How cool does that sound now?

—Btw, Congress implements taxes.

Sure. Absolutely. And then, should we, the citizens of the United States, change our minds, we can make supplication for the return of our liberty to exercise our inherent right of self defense. Hey, we can try something like this: “An’ it please the Crown, might we, the poor, benighted peasants, be permitted to once again bear the single most effective physical tool of self defense for our own protection and that of our families?” Each of us will, of course, be sure to touch our forelocks when we make such a bold request.

So, no, gun ownership in the US should most emphatically not be made illegal.

First, you need to read The Samurai, the Mountie and the Cowboy by David B. Kopel. The comparison of the historical backgrounds and current status of gun availability in different cultures and histories is addressed well.

Second: Remember this: "When seconds count, the police are only minutes away." Imagine if the next day an article about Sandy Hook told of the young woman teacher in the next room that had obtained a concealed carry permit for her own protection. She had training. She carried a small caliber handgun in her purse (assuming legality for this fictional exercise). She heard

Imagine if the next day an article about Sandy Hook told of the young woman teacher in the next room that had obtained a concealed carry permit for her own protection. She had training. She carried a small caliber handgun in her purse (assuming legality for this fictional exercise). She heard and recognized gunshots, looked through the glass of the class next door, popped in and put two quick shots into the perp. He even lived to go on trial.

Third: Remember this: In nice country towns (in the American West at least) 90%+ of the police are good, honest, and upright citizens. This number changes as you move into the inner city in major towns. Do you want the police to be the only ones with guns when a certain number of them are the thugs you knew in high school that just happened not to get caught? Sad but true.

Fourth: Do you trust yourself? I do. I have training and experience. I keep my skills honed. I live in an area where most of my neighbors (doctors, attorneys, software engineers, and executives) have concealed carry permits. Would-be criminals know that my neighborhood is heavily armed. Someone said that we are just "exporting" our crime problem. My reply: "And your point is . . . ?"

Fifth: When taking criminal law in law school my professor was the former DA of a major California county. He was a legend that had argued many criminal procedure cases before the Supreme Court. I don't remember all the details of criminal law and criminal procedure, but I will never forget the statistics he showed us (granted, this was some years ago) that criminals did not fear getting caught (they are pathological); they do not fear prison (again pathologically not thinking that far head); but they live in fear of an armed victim. That's me.

Seriously?

Besides requiring a near-complete restructuring of the Constitution, how would this possible? Also, where's the public support for such a measure? And finally, how would it be enacted?

I'll ignore the "gun nut" pejorative as that is actually one of the least weak elements of your proposition. There is no public sentiment for making firearms ownership illegal. While that doesn't seem to have registered with you, questioner, it is the case. Most people just want to have fewer crimes committed using firearms which is a different matter entirely.

Even if there were a large public

While that doesn't seem to have registered with you, questioner, it is the case. Most people just want to have fewer crimes committed using firearms which is a different matter entirely.

Even if there were a large public groundswell of people wanting firearms banned, we have a constitutional process that would have to be followed to ensure that it would happen. That would years, or even several decades, as in a nation with rule of law, court challenges must heard. Abortion, a right
not explicitly covered in the Constitution, has been bandied about for 43 years and it's not going to go away any time soon. Firearms are, in many places, a far less controversial subject than abortion and it IS explicitly addressed in the Constitution.

Additionally, even if an amendment was put forth and ratified banning the sale of guns, the states would still retain their rights under the Tenth Amendment. They can make firearms ownership by their residents legal or illegal and many of them would choose the former. What then? The government going void the Tenth Amendment or propose that it also be changed?

Good luck with that.

Finally, how exactly are current owners going to be compensated for their property? Are they going to have to surrender their firearms without receiving any recompense for that? That's a lawsuit. Are they going to only receive set amounts from the government below what they paid for the weapon(s)? There's another lawsuit. Are they going to receive full retail price for them? great...but where's the money going to come from?

Don't say "gun owners" as you have just banned their weapon's ownership. If you were thinking that...well.....then there's ANOTHER lawsuit for you.

Not so certain why it is hard to understand that this is a right enshrined in the US Constitution. It's one of the Bill of Rights and there's no great public pressure to change or alter any of those. If YOU don't wish to own firearms, then exercise that right for yourself. Don't try to tell others how to exercise their own rights, especially when the majority of them have nothing to do with you or your own personal safety.

He (The President) can introduce legislation calling for it, in the House.

The House can act on it and send it to the Senate.

The Senate can act on it and send it to the President to sign into law.
