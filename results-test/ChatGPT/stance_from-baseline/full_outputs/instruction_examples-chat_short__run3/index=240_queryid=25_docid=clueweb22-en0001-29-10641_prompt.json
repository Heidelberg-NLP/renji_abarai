pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should education be free?
Text: Should All Education be Free Free Essay Example

Should All Education be Free

All education should be free to all people and paid for by the government. This statement has caused great controversy over the past decades.

  ‚Ä¢ On the one hand, it should be free since there are poor who are smart, intelligent and capable, yet the state provides no education for them. How would you feel knowing that your life is never going to get better because you don‚Äôt have the opportunity?
  ‚Ä¢ Another argument is economic development. Finishing school and pursuing a career will allow you to get a higher standard of living hence economic development.

  ‚Ä¢ The last argument for free education is economic growth. If everyone gets a well paid job, they will contribute to society by becoming taxpayers. The state will be capable of improving the country.
  ‚Ä¢ On the other hand, it shouldn‚Äôt be free as tax would need to increase to provide free education and not many are pleased with this idea. However, if tax doesn‚Äôt increase, we will get a mediocre education.

    This is seen in Peru where there aren‚Äôt even enough schools and universities.

  ‚Ä¢ In addition, if everyone gets educated, no one would want to take the low paid jobs. An example is Spain. An ex-CEO prefers not to work rather than to work as a taxi driver.

In conclusion I do think that education should be free since it is our right to get the opportunity to improve our lives. Yes, it can be very expensive for the state at first, but the advantages are invaluable to our society.
