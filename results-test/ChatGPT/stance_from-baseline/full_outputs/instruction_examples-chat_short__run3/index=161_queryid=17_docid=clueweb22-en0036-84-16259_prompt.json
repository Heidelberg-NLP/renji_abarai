Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should recreational marijuana be legal?
Text: Why Recreational Marijuana Should Be Legal
Start writing a post

 

Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, and Alaska: currently, these are the states that allow the use of marijuana for recreational purposes. This number of states increases exponentially when discussing the legality of medical marijuana and cannabis; twenty more states, not including the 8 aforementioned, have passed legislation allowing for the use of the drug.

The reasons behind this decision are obvious, though often controversial. The counterargument to the legalization of weed frequently stems from an uninformed conviction that cannabis is detrimental to personal health and safety. In a 2012 review of marijuana research published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine, it was concluded that though ingesting cannabis causes significant changes in short-term physical behavior, impairing memory and concentration, there are likely no long-term effects from regular consumption of the drug.

Studies have also shown that legalization would not result in a significant increase in use. “Science and government have learned a great deal, for example, about how to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors,” the Times wrote in an article on marijuana’s effects. “There is already some early evidence that regulation would also help combat teen marijuana use, which fell after Colorado began broadly regulating medical marijuana in 2010.”

Prohibition also has serious economic determinants. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 49.5% of all drug-violation arrests are connected to marijuana, meaning that half of the population in prison for substance abuse is incarcerated due to marijuana-related crimes. According to the Urban Institute Justice Policy Center, the yearly cost for an inmate in a minimum security prison is $21,006, with the average prison sentence for inmates incarcerated for marijuana abuse being 36.8 months. With 757,969 individuals incarcerated for marijuana abuse in 2011 according to public FBI statistics, each costing $21,006 a year, the price to incarcerate every person in the United States linked to a marijuana related crime is $15,921,896,814 yearly and $44 billion over more than 30 years.

Tumblr

Well folks, the tundra is turning into the tropics. Store away the snow boots and say peace out to the parkas, because it is time for these 10 critical winter-to-spring transitions:

1. Scary Hairy to Soft n' Smooth

Bears, it's post-hibernation time.

2. Pumpkin Spice Lattes to Iced Caramel Frappes

Cold caffeine will be consumed in the environment it deserves.

3. Layered Covered Limbs to Exposed Epidermis

Time to get as tan as pawsibble.

4. Beans to Keens

Time to let the toes breathe in style.

5. Frackets to Non-Jackets

Not below freezing you say? Guess that fracket is going away.


6. Soups to Salads

I accept the last-minute-bikini-bod prep

7. Beanie Caps to Bucket Hats

Shade the spring sun with the oddest head gear possible.

8. Colds&Coughs to Cut Offs

#FreeTheUpperThighsSpring2k16

9. North Face to South By Sea

Break out those rain coats and srat pastel tanks~

10. Timbs to...

Who am I kidding, those shoes are staying on all four seasons and the apocalypse.

Although you'll probably curse us with a snow storm a week before May, goodbye Winter.

***

It's out with the old and in with what's socially Spring acceptable.

Goodbye snow clouds of gray, hello skies of blue and rain clouds.

A pre-mature dip in the pool, a trip to the spa.

A few days in my shades.

The whole part of this hemisphere according to the Spring season.

5 Books to Read This Spring

Spring is in full bloom and what better way to spend it reading cool books?

5 Books to Read This Spring

Thanks to my Kindle, I've gotten back into the realm of reading, and it's been great so far. I've always been a reader, and although you may rather spend your time basking in the spring sun, here are five books to curl up with just before bed.

*in no particular order

1) Doghead by Morten Ramsland

Doghead tells the story of a dysfunctional Norwegian family throughout several generations. The book is hilarious and its characters are funky. Although a medium-length this books flies by.

2) The Enchanted by Rene Denfeld

I'll admit: this book was kind of very depressing. It takes place in an "enchanted place" of a prison set in presumably modern-day society. The story weaves multiple POV's but in a way that is smooth, and you sympathize for each character. Even if it's magical realism, you also question the criminal justice system.

3) Wool by Hugh Howey

Perhaps my favorite modern sci-fi book of all time, Wool takes place in a futuristic society where people live in underground silos. No one has been outside for decades, except for those who clean the cameras stationed outside. The book is suspensful, full of action and thrills that will want you to read it again.

4) An Anatomy of Small Bombs by Karan Mahajan

Mahajan's second book focuses on multiple characters as they struggle through the repercussions of a terrorist attack in India. The book is haunting and acts as part of an allegory to today's political climate.

5) Catalog of Unabashed Attitude by Ross Gay

I'm not one for poetry, but Gay is able to keep my attention throughout Catalog. His poems range from a variety of topics as well as styles, and it's really refreshing to be able to see how funky you can get with poetry and still understand every single word. The diction is beautiful as well as Gay himself (yes, I got to hear him speak!).

Best Summer Songs For The Best Summer Vibes

I love all types of music, and of course, I listen to the most popular stuff and really like it. Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Galantis, Trippie Redd, Khalid, and a bunch of different remixes are some of my favorites. That being said, something about summer time makes me want to listen to songs that make me feel the happiest - and I have a unique playlist of songs that capture these exact feelings. Super carefree, laid back, and well summery. Well, they aren't completely unique, but they are songs I only find myself listening to as the summer months come closer. Next time you are in the car with a group of your best friends driving home from a day at the beach in the sunset... maybe you will consider these songs to add to your next playlist!
