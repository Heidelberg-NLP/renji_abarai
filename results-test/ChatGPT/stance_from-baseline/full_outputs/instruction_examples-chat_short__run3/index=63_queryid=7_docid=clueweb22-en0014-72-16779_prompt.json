pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should felons who have completed their sentence be allowed to vote?
Text: Are Felons Allowed to Vote in Texas?

Are Felons Allowed to Vote in Texas?

The right to vote is something Texas residents and other U.S. citizens take pride in because they have the power to make their voices heard and participate in our democracy. With the midterms coming up and the presidential election only two years away, millions of Americans have registered to exercise this right.

However, can felons vote in Texas? While it is generally assumed that felons are prohibited from voting, that is not always the case.

Felons cannot register to vote if they obtain a final conviction Texas. However, a felon who has successfully completed his/her sentence—which includes their period of confinement, term of probation, term of parole, or has obtained a pardon—can register to vote.

If a felon’s conviction is on appeal or has obtained a deferred adjudication, he/she can still vote. Additionally, if an individual is merely prosecuted or indicted for a felony, he/she can still vote.

Keep in mind, ex-felons must re-register to vote, instead of simply showing up at the polls. They can request an official, postage-paid voting application, or download an informal application, from the Secretary of State’s website. It is possible to register to vote when renewing or applying for a Texas driver’s license.

Once the registration is complete, they can mail it to their designated County Voter Registrar or turn it in by hand to the same office. The office should receive the application 30 days before the scheduled election to obtain eligibility to vote. A voter registration certificate will then be mailed within 30 days.

To determine if a felon is eligible to vote, the Texas Department of Public Safety sends information which lists individuals who have a final conviction to the Secretary of State’s office each week. The information is then compared to the data of all registered voters. When matches occur, the results are sent to the specific counties of those individuals. The counties will then send these individuals a written notice of investigation, which they must respond within 30 days or be removed from registration.

Felons who are not eligible to vote but do so anyway could face criminal penalties.
