Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Teens Be Allowed to Vote?

 

 

By Anna Starecheski and Laura Anastasia

One California city may let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local elections.

Teens can do a lot to change the world. They can start food drives. They can pick up litter. They can donate money to causes they believe in.

There is one thing younger teens can’t do to change the world. They can’t vote. People must be at least 18 years old to vote in most elections in the United States.

But that might change soon in San Francisco, California. In November, city residents will vote on whether to let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local elections.

A handful of smaller cities already let young teens vote in local elections. But San Francisco would be the first big U.S. city to do it.

Should 16- and 17-year-olds be allowed to vote? Here are both sides.

Yes!

Government decisions affect teens’ lives. So more teens deserve a voice in how their city is run, some people say. In addition, voting is a habit, others argue. People who start voting at 16 might be more likely to vote as adults.

No!

Voting is an important responsibility. But younger teens might not take it seriously, some people say. Others argue that many teens do not know enough about the government. They may not understand what they are voting on until they get older.


What do you think? Should 16- and 17-year-olds be allowed to vote? Why or why not?

Voting Through the Years

Will young teens get the right to vote? They might! The rules about who can vote have changed over time. Here is how. 

1788-1789
The first election for president takes place. In most states, only white men who own land or a business can vote.

1870
The 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is approved. It gives all men the right to vote, regardless of their skin color. But some states make new rules to stop Black men from voting.

1920
The 19th Amendment is approved. It gives women the right to vote. But some state rules still prevent Black women from voting.

1924
A new law declares that Native Americans are U.S. citizens. That means they can vote. Some states block Native Americans from voting anyway.

1965
The Voting Rights Act is passed. The law says states can not prevent or make it difficult for Black people, Native Americans, and other groups to vote.

1971
The voting age is lowered from 21 to 18. Young Americans had argued that if they were old enough to fight in the Vietnam War (1962-1975), they were old enough to vote. 

1975
A new Voting Rights Act is passed. It helps people who don’t speak English. It says cities must have ballots in other languages.

1990
The Americans with Disabilities Act is passed. It says states must make sure people with disabilities are able to vote.
