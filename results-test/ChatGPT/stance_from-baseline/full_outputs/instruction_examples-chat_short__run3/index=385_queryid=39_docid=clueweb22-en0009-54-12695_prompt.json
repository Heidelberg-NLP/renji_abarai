Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should the federal minimum wage be increased?
Text: Should the minimum wage be increased

Should the Minimum Wage be Increased?

Part 1

            Perhaps one issue of concern to many is regarding the minimum wage hike. However, raising the minimum wage does not only concern the minimum wage workers but actually almost every person in the community, from the simplest unit such as the family to the whole community. It is not just a simple issue of increasing the salary of the employees but rather, a matter that the whole country is involve.

            Raising the minimum would somehow ensure that the workers as well as their family will be able to live an easier life. They will be able to attend to the needs of their families with a greater salary thus, a greater chance of living a more comfortable life and access to necessities such as health care, education and the likes.

            However, it is in the governments hand on whether or not to increase the minimum wage in their particular area of authority. Thus, the government itself considers the importance of having a minimum wage increase as well as the impact that it could bring to the country.

            Most employees may affirm the raising of the minimum wage because of the idea that an increase in their salary would be helpful to their daily living. Who would not want a higher payment/salary anyway? It is basically the main reason of raising the minimum wage; to help the minimum wage earners or those in the lower class of the society. Even different labor unions are supporters of the minimum wage increase. Labor unions support the increase primarily because the increased in the minimum wage “will put a strong upward pressure on the entire wage structure” (Alesse and Gilbault, 2004).

            It can be said that as time pass by, the cost of living also increases. Therefore, the wage of the workers should also be increased in order to compensate for the changes in the economic environment. Because of this, there had been many raises in the minimum wage of the workers in past years.

            According to the United States Department of Labor, the minimum wage increases from time to time. In the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the minimum wage is $0.25. After more than 50 decades, the minimum wage was reaches $3.8 which is very far from the years that past. Today, the minimum wage in the United States is $6.55, almost doubled from $3.8 in 1990. Thus, changes in the minimum wage of workers had been part of history and although there had been some transitions in the values (since there had been cases of reduction in the minimum wage in the past years.), increase in the minimum wage is more likely to happen rather than decrease minimum wage.

The issue of increasing the minimum wage has also been a long battle in the American government between the Republicans and the Democrats. The Democrats believed that raising the minimum wage is necessary for the country and the people to help those employees to live a decent life. They believe that it is something that the masses will benefit from and eventually, the country as a whole. On the other hand, the Republicans believe that raising the minimum will not be beneficial for the country since it will have other impacts to the country’s economy that outweighs its positive effects in the country such as the increase in the unemployment rate due to layoffs or company shutdowns.

The issue of raising the minimum wage is like a battle between the lower class in the country against those in the upper class; the employees against the employers. However, as mentioned above, raising the minimum wage is not only between the employees and the employers, it is a matter that will affect the whole country and thus, other factors must be taken account of. The government is definitely involve in the decision making process for it is responsible for the welfare of the people and of the whole state. It some instances, the consumers may also be affected due to some other effects of wage increase.

In a larger scope, society will greatly be affected by raising the minimum wage. However, it could either be a threat or an opportunity for the community. Raising the minimum would lead in income for the country since more taxes can be generated from the employees. On the other hand, increasing the minimum wage may also cause increase in the unemployment rate in the country. (US Department of Labor, 2008)

On the other hand, although the amount of wage increased by multiple times, there are still those who fail to support their financial needs. This also shows not only the minimum wage increased but as well as the market price of the products that increases the cost of living in the country. Therefore, an increase in the wage means also an increase in commodities and other things necessity in our everyday life.

            Although, there are advantages of raising the minimum wage, there also disadvantages that that most employees fail to see because of the promising increase in their salary. Considering these effects, I believe that it would be better if the minimum wage was not raised. The threats offered by raising a minimum wage are far greater than the promises it offers to the people and to the community. An increase in the minimum wage does not only offer increase in salary but in personal expenses as well; an increase in the cost of products or services available in the market. So, would rising the minimum wage guarantee a life free from poverty? Although the minimum wage is increased, the amount required by an individual to live would also increase. Therefore, the increased in the wage will only be felt for a short period of time and eventually, the amount of things that can be bought by the past wage will only be equal to what can be bought if the minimum wages of the workers are increased. It would just be for the sake of formality but the condition of the workers is not likely to change. Therefore, the minimum wage should not be raised.

PART 2

Perhaps business men are the ones that are the primary opponent of raising the minimum wages if they are not the only group since they are the ones that will definitely be affected in a negative sense. In terms of businesses, small businesses would be definitely affected in a larger scale that may even lead in some employees loosing their jobs. Raising the minimum wage would endanger small businesses that cannot afford to increase the wage of their employees. If ever the company or business continue to operate considering the increase in the wage of the employees, that particular business are likely to decreased the number of employees or to raise the prices of their products to accommodate the increase in the minimum wage. This is true especially in small businesses. Thus, the employees who desire increase in their wages can also be affected by the wage increase in a negative way together with the people in the community.

Increasing the minimum wage will increase unemployment since company’s are likely to hire lesser employees while some maybe forced to just close the business because of the inability to cope with the increase in the minimum wage. Inflation is another aspect that must be considered resulting from higher wages because companies will also tend to increase the purchase price of their products or services because of the wage hike. Thus, damaging those it (the wage increase) is trying to protect. It would be a big question whether a nation with high unemployment rate and loosing manufacturing jobs everyday would be able to afford the increase in the minimum wage (Alesse and Gilbault, 2004).

Although it can be said that the increase in the cost of a particular product can increase the tax revenue of the state, it is not always the case. This is because the demand for that product is likely to decrease (Alesse and Gilbault, 2004). Although the amount increases, the quantity of products taxable by the government decreases. Thus, it cannot be said that the increase in the minimum wage would generate greater tax for the government because of the increase in the product demand. Also, it is likely that the production cost of the product will increase that will cause a decreased in the production thus, also decreasing the tax revenue (Alesse and Gilbault, 2004).

            Aside from direct economic impact, researches also showed that raising the minimum wage also has indirect negative impacts to the country. Increase in the minimum wage presents a greater chance and opportunity for the people and thus, the people’s eagerness to work also increases because of the increase opportunity to earn more. This can be considered a good effect since the motivation of the employee’s are increased. However, researchers from Michigan State University found that raising the minimum wage have a wider social impact, it encourage the teenagers to leave school and work instead (Alesse and Gilbault, 2004). This would be a problem to the country since the decreased in the number of skilled-workers who have college or master’s degrees will require the country to hire workers from other places or countries more suitable for the job. As a result, lower-skilled workers are being replaced by these students . This will really cost mush to business in the country and to the state as a whole. Thus, if minimum wage is increased, lower-skilled workers, whom raising the wage intended to help, are likely to lose their jobs.
