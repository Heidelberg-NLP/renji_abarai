Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Do Standardized Test Scores Measure Education Quality?

The purpose of standardized tests in schools is to give educators an objective, unbiased perspective of the effectiveness of their instruction. Although standardized testing was designed to identify the natural aptitudes of individual students, over the years some educators have found additional factors may skew the results. 

Keep reading to learn more about standardized testing or visit the ViewSonic Education page for further insights into learning outcomes.   

Standardized tests have been a part of U.S. education since the mid-1800s. But their popularity really skyrocketed in 2002 when the No Child Left Behind Act mandated annual testing in all 50 states.  

Since then, there’s been much debate about whether or not standardized testing can truly measure education quality—and how much weight should be given to standardized test scores. Like most arguments, there are strong opinions and points to be made on both sides. 

Some say that standardized testing is the best way to accurately and objectively evaluate students’ academic progress. Others, however, are strongly opposed—believing that achievement tests provide skewed, inaccurate results, and preclude many students from being able to exhibit their individual knowledge.  

But before we delve into each of these arguments, let’s define what standardized tests are, what exactly they are designed to do, and what they are used for.  

What Are Standardized Tests? 

According to The Glossary of Education Reform, “A standardized test is any form of test that (1) requires all test takers to answer the same questions, or a selection of questions from a common bank of questions, in the same way, and that (2) is scored in a “standard” or consistent manner, which makes it possible to compare the relative performance of individual students or groups of students.” 

What are Standardized Tests? 

What Are Standardized Tests Intended to Do? 

Standardized test scores are used by districts and states to identify student progress, measure how students are performing in different schools, and compare how different groups of students perform relative to others. States also use these test scores to identify the lowest-performing schools and provide those schools with needed support. An important point to note is that standardized test scores also help decide the distribution of federal funds across the USA.  

But are standardized tests truly fair to students and teachers? In the bigger picture, does this type of testing work? 

Reasons to Support Standardized Testing 

  1. Standardized testing is a practical and accurate way of evaluating what a student does or doesn’t know across important areas like math, reading, and writing.  
  2. It can provide helpful benchmarks for teachers and parents. This can help them evaluate how a student is doing compared to others in their class, their city, and their geographic region. 
  3. Standardized testing can identify learning gaps in students. This helps teachers focus on students who need more attention, in hopes of getting all students to meet basic proficiency levels and achieve basic skills.  
  4. It can also guide curriculum choices and give structure for what needs to be taught. This helps teachers align their classroom materials and provides a measure of accountability for what goes into the classroom. 
  5. Standardized tests eliminate the risk of subjective grading. They ensure thoughtful rationale behind each test question and help to eliminate discrimination and marking bias. 

Advantages of Standardized Testing

Arguments Against Standardized Testing 

  1. At face value, standardized tests appear to be fair because every student takes the same test and evaluations are largely objective. However, a one-size-fits-all testing approach is arguably biased because it can’t account for certain factors that are unique to each student, such as their mental health, learning disabilities, anxiety, difficult home lives, language barriers, or socioeconomic status. Or perhaps a student just isn’t a good test-taker. 
  2. Standardized tests fail to account for students who learn and demonstrate academic proficiency in different ways. For example, a student may be an excellent writer but struggles to answer a multiple-choice question about punctuation and grammar.
  3. High-stakes testing like standardized test scores can place undue stress on students and may affect student performance. Unreasonable pressure from schools or parents may even lead to anxiety, cheating, or the use of performance drugs. 
  4. The pressure to raise standardized test scores often forces teachers to “teach to the test” rather than provide a broad curriculum. Subjects like art and music, which are not currently tested in most states, get less emphasis, and students may miss being exposed to a rich academic environment. 
  5. Standardized tests don’t provide any feedback on how to perform better. The results are not even returned to teachers and students until months later, and they don’t include any guidance on how to improve these test scores. 
  6. Achievement test scores can lead to false assumptions of teacher effectiveness. These days, if a school’s standardized achievement test scores are high, people think the school’s staff is effective. If test scores are low, they view the teachers as ineffective. This can place unfair blame on good teachers who have low test scores while ignoring teaching deficiencies if scores are high.  
  7. Some opponents argue that standardized tests only determine which students are good at taking tests—their scores are not predictors of future success. Even if a high school student does well on a standardized test, it doesn’t mean they know what they need to know before they get to college, or that they’ll do well there.    

Disadvantages of Standardized Testing

Final Thoughts 

Despite the criticism, standardized testing does serve an important function within education. Schools need to have a benchmarking system in place in order to measure the performance and progress of students, and the government needs to have a way to identify schools that need additional support. However, as pointed out, the system is not without its flaws and there are certainly areas that need to be addressed. Hopefully, with enough discussion of these criticisms, standardized testing can continue to serve the function it was created for, but a solution can be found that provides a more balanced result.
