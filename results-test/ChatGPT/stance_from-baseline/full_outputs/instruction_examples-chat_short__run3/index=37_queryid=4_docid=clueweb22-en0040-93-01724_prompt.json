Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Why Corporal Punishment Should Be Banned

Corporal punishment should be banned since numerous studies have proved that when pain is inflicted on an individual, it does not necessarily change his or her behavior. Corporal punishment has over the years been used at home and in school as a means of influencing behavioral change among young people. At home, parents tend to punish their children, especially when their behavior is deemed as arrogant or when they engage in naughty activities. In addition, teachers have used corporal punishment in schools to influence behavioral change among students and also influence them to work hard in their academics. However, evidence reveals that corporate punishment is a form of violence which has little influence in motivating positive change and it may even lead to rebellion both at home and in school.

Corporal punishment has been banned in different countries since evidence has shown that it may in fact impact negatively on positive development of young people. There are different forms of corporal punishment, including slapping, pinching, or beating using different objects such as sticks, belts, and so on. It is important to note that any method that is used to inflict pain on another person can promote violence, especially when the victim resists or defends himself. Furthermore, corporal punishment and any other form of violence have been prohibited in various schools in America since authorities regard it as illegal. Prohibition of corporal punishment was first implemented in numerous private schools, with the policy also being implemented in homes where parents are asked to utilize other methods of instilling positive behavior on their children. There are alternatives to corporal punishment that have been recommended by psychologists, and which parents should always follow in order to instill discipline among their children.

Research studies have argued that children tend to learn when they imitate the behaviors of their elders. This implies that parents, teachers and other adults act as important role models who influence the kind of behaviors that are adopted by children. Therefore, when children are exposed to corporal punishment or any other of form of violence, they may end up using violent tendencies against their colleagues. It is evident that the main aim of elders is to bring up children who are respectful, trustworthy, and people of integrity. Therefore, corporate punishment should not be used as a rationale of developing good behavior since it can have negative repercussions, including low self-esteem and increasing the risk of depression and even suicide. Scholars are of the opinion that corporal punishment tends to affect children differently, but the negative results usually outweigh the positive factors.

Another important consideration is the fact that corporal punishment does not have any direct relationship with educational curriculum and it should therefore not be used as part of disciplinary method in schools. What this simply means is that corporal punishment does not add any educational value to young people. Therefore, teachers should use other useful means of instilling discipline instead of punishments that have a negative physical consequence. Teachers should also collaborate with parents, especially when the behavior of a child is deemed to be irreparable and beyond the standards of the learning institution. It is from this perspective where children can be exposed to success stories of individuals who were respectful and pay attention to their leaders since discipline can be taught as one of the most effective examples of success. All forms of corporal punishments have been opposed by numerous professional associations since there are more efficient techniques of instilling discipline instead of beating people.
