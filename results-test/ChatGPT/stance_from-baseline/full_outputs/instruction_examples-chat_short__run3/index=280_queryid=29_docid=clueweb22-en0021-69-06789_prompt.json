Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Should Illegal Immigrants Become Citizens Essay

Good Essays
Our nation is a melting pot of many different cultures. America has become famous for its thriving diversity. This would not have been possible if it weren’t for the many immigrants, who come here in search of a better life. As of lately though, there has been much controversy over whether or not we should allow those who come here illegally to be granted amnesty. As a daughter of immigrant parents, I know first hand about how dedicated immigrants are, and the difficulties it would cause to send them back to their former country. Illegal immigrants should be allowed to become citizens. Not only do they boost our economy greatly, they cost too much money to deport, and they take the jobs that many of us don’t. It is important that we allow legalization for the illegal immigrants that come to this country because it benefits our economy, it is too expensive to deport them, and they are responsible for many of our labor intensive and unwanted jobs. To begin with, granting illegal immigrants with citizenship will boost our economy. “Legal status would boost the economy, but the resulting productivity and wage gains would be much…show more content…
According to the Center for American progress, “It would cost $200 billion to deport all the illegal immigrants currently in the , and an additional $85 billion to enforce this policy for the next five years. In total, the cost of deporting illegal immigrants back to their countries would cost taxpayers $285 billion.” This means that our taxes would increase greatly if we spent our money on deporting illegal immigrants. That money could go to providing health care, or supplies for schools. Most immigrants have lived here long enough to have built a family, and spending our taxes to rip these homes apart is simply inhumane. As you can see, deporting immigrants is too expensive, and in addition, breaks families
