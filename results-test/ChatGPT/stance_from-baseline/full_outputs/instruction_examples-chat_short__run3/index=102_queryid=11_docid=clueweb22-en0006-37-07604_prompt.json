Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Athletics are inherently competitive. If an athlete is not competing with someone else, they are competing with who they were yesterday, striving to do better, to be better. And the pressure to improve is not merely internal; from coaches to parents to fans, it seems that everyone around athletes pushes them to do more and be more.

While they often seem supernatural in their abilities, athletes are human, and humans have their limitations. So how do athletes handle the conflict between pressure to improve and their own limitations? Is there a prevalence of drugs in sport?

Performance Enhancing Drugs

Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) are substances used to improve physical ability, notorious for their illegal use in athletic competitions. While these substances may not be illegal in general use, their clandestine use in sports, known as doping, is commonly prohibited.

The history behind drug use in sports goes as far back as ancient times, claiming that doping might have been present as far back as the . However, in relatively more modern times, one of the earliest records of doping was during an endurance walking race where a contestant admitted to using opiates to stay alert.

Such endurance races eventually increased in popularity to the extent where participants stood to win rather impressive prizes. It proved to be a worthy incentive for the athletes to consume substances to improve their performance, even with the side effects that many of them caused, such as psychosis.

Anabolic steroids, used to improve the ease and efficiency of building muscle, became a mainstay among weightlifters and bodybuilders in the 20th century.

The health risks of drug abuse in athletes and the unfair advantage experienced by them were significant enough to induce the formation of the in 1999.

The use of PEDs has increased in recent years. However, this is largely due to the availability of more options, many of which feel safer to athletes than traditional drugs. While the idea of injecting steroids may have seemed off-putting to all but the most driven athletes, taking a supplement that can be purchased at any health store seems less risky or even normal. And doing so is socially acceptable. As a result, , both engaged in sport and not, use substances to improve performance and appearance. While women use these substances as well, their use is .

Although the medical concern is most significant for teens abusing drugs like PEDs, that is generally not where the media focuses. Instead, the media and the public are most concerned with doping in major league sports. Both Major League Baseball and the National Football League have seen significant controversy in recent years related to players’ drug use in sports. The current conversation around the practice can be traced back to the revelation of steroid use in MLB players back in the late 90s to early 2000s. have been related to performance-enhancing drugs since 2005; on the NFL side, hundreds of games have been missed due to temporary suspensions related to doping.

Side Effects Of Performance Enhancing Drugs

There are several kinds of performance-enhancing drugs in sport. Essentially all of these substances have side effects, even the ones which are found naturally in the body.

Anabolic steroids are used to increase muscle growth. However, these drugs can cause breast growth, prostate gland enlargement, smaller testicles, and infertility in men. Women may become more masculine, with a deeper voice, more body hair, baldness, and infrequent menstruation. , aggressive behavior, and psychiatric disorders are also possibilities, among many more.

Side effects of performance enhancing drugs.

Other performance-enhancing drugs, such as human growth hormone, erythropoietin, and stimulants, can cause an array of adverse effects. These effects include many severe cardiovascular reactions, such as hypertension, reduced blood pressure, pulmonary embolism, stroke, enlargement of the heart, and heart attack.

Other Drug Use Among Athletes

While the drive to perform at their very best pushes athletes to use drugs in sport, they face other factors that can cause different kinds of drug abuse.

They have to perform on large stages, with many people’s expectations resting on them. This pressure predisposes them to mental health conditions such as anxiety, stress, and depression. It can result in drug abuse in athletes, of medications like anxiolytics and antidepressants.

Besides prescription medication, many athletes may turn to illicit substances to deal with mental health conditions, stressors, and pain that they experience.

However, most of them indicated their use was for social purposes and not anything relating to sports.

A study performed among young elite athletes in Italy provided interesting information showing that the most used illicit drug among athletes is cannabis. However, it was only seen in of samples tested. Following that was cocaine, in 0.1% of samples.

The information from among professional athletes demonstrated opioid use in under 5% of participants in the study.

Causes Of Drug Abuse in Athletes

As with any drug use, the exact reasons an athlete turns to drugs in sport are personal. However, a common factor is—as one would assume—improved performance and physical condition.

However, it is essential to keep in mind that athletes may also use illicit drugs for recreational purposes in addition to their PEDs, similar to non-athletes. It means that athletes have two different avenues of drug use in sports.

Why Do Athletes Use PEDs?

  • The drive to win. Every athlete has a moment where a win can change their life, and a loss could be the end of their career. Some sporting moments are remembered for decades. For professional athletes, sports are not about fun; but about winning. There is little care given to in many cases.
  • The athletic physical form. In most sports, physique matters only as far as it helps performance. However, bulking is critical in some sports because appearance or physical form is central to winning. The most notable is bodybuilding, with the PED most often used being anabolic steroids. Approximately acknowledge steroid use; studies that do not rely on self-reporting are likely to see higher results. However, are used as an alternative or in addition to this drug use in sports. In some cases, they may be unaware they are using steroids. Many that are not on the packaging.
  • The future at large. Many young people who use PEDs are concerned for their future. For many student-athletes, an athletic scholarship is the only choice for a college education. High performance is needed before admission and throughout college to maintain the scholarship. , so these scholarships are even more vital. require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree, with only 36% accepting a high school diploma or less, and most do not pay living wages. Many young athletes feel pushed towards performance-enhancing drug use in sports as a result.

What Are the Different Types of Performance Enhancing Drugs?

Steroids are easily the most well-known type of doping drug; however, they are not the only type. They are not even the most commonly used performance-enhancing drug; instead, general supplements are, with creatine leading the pack. The consequences of use—both physically and within the sports world—vary depending on the drug used.

PEDs used in sport.

Below are some of the most commonly used :

Anabolic Steroids

Anabolic steroids are synthetic drugs that mimic or enhance the effects of testosterone. They encourage muscle growth. In medical settings, they can be used to treat muscle loss and delay the onset of puberty. Anabolic steroids can affect sex hormone production in men, resulting in shrunken testicles, infertility, gynecomastia, and prostate enlargement. In women, they will begin to develop ‘manly’ features such as baldness, more body hair, and a bigger clitoris.

General side effects include acne, inhibited growth in teenagers, hypertension, liver tumors, and psychiatric disorders.

Stimulants

Stimulants are drugs that act on the central nervous system by speeding up physical processes. It can mean increased heart rate and blood flow and elevated body temperature. Drug abuse in athletes covers both legal, illegal, and prescription stimulants. Some examples include amphetamines, cocaine, and even nicotine. Stimulants may negatively affect physical performance, however. This is due to side effects such as dehydration, heatstroke, and nervousness. Addiction to stimulants can also occur, along with tolerance.

Human Growth Hormone

Human growth hormone naturally occurs within the body. However, synthetic versions have become very popular within the world of sports. When it occurs naturally, it helps teens grow their bones during puberty and strengthen the skeletal structure overall; in medical settings, it can be used to help those who are not producing enough during puberty or who are fighting certain diseases, such as HIV. However, it is used in sports for another reason.

Diabetes, visual disturbances, hypertension, joint pain, and cardiomegaly can occur due to abuse of this prescription medication.

Erythropoietin

Erythropoietin is a hormone produced by the kidneys in response to insufficient oxygen in the body cells. It functions by stimulating the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. In medical settings, it is used to treat anemia. This substance increases how much oxygen the muscles get, which helps keep them non-fatigued and primed.
