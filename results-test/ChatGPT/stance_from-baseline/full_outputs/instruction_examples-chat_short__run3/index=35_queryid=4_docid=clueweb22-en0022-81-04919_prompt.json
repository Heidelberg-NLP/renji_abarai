neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Corporal Punishment Should Be Reintroduced

Corporal Punishment as described by the Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus (in one volume – 1990) is “punishment of a physical nature such as caning”. The term mainly relates to children being punished at school but can also refer to children being punished at home. As of 2008 corporal punishment has been banned in 24 countries, including Germany, Greece and the Netherlands. Nevetheless, it is still widely used by parents in their homes. In the UK, corporal punishment has been banned in schools for numerous years. However a debate is now arising as to whether the decision to ban corporal punishment in schools was the right decision and hence, whether corporal punishment should be reintroduced?

All the Yes points:

  1. bad behaviour is on the increase in the class room
  2. there has been an increase in crime
  3. there is a lack of father figues in the home
  4. other sanctions have no effect
  5. rights culture needs to be impeded
  6. it will improve the lives of those who are bullied
  7. Asbo’s dont work – swift punishment may prevent bad behaviour later
  8. it works!
  9. Montaigne
  10. The administration of corporal punishment made us grow up to become responsible citizen.
  11. It depends on how the actual punishement is administered
  12. it makes a direct link between a behavior and its bad consequences

All the No points:

  1. It has been made illegal in so many countries for a reason.
  2. It increases the rate of crime and violence.
  3. It has negative psychological effects.
  4. It is wrong and inappropriate.
  5. harms children with genuine behavioural disorders or other disabilities
  6. Currently legal in 21 states. Where is the betterment?
  7. old corp
  8. I think corpral punishment should be eleagle in every country.
  9. It brings fear in the person
  10. it makes the victim hardend
  11. it can lead to death
  12. For children, actions speak louder than words.
  13. Many students who misbehave in school come from unstable families
  14. Allowing children to be hit sends the message that it is OK to treat children in this way.
  15. If teachers and parents weren’t allowed to hit children, they would discipline them in better ways.

bad behaviour is on the increase in the class room

Yes because…

In a survey completed by the Times Educational supplement (1), 6000 teachers were questioned. One in five believed that class room behaviour had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment and they believed the education system would improve with the re-introduction of corporal punishment. We should adhere to the teachers requests.

Old Corp

frustrated and afraid i grow
our society in decline
discipline, personal responsibility
only few adhere to

how far must the pendulum swing
is this when, enough is enough!

learn we must from past misfortunes
our elders abused and taken for,
those locked rooms, monsters behind unchecked
horrors lived, compassion grow-ed, forced upon;
Justly! the Corporal dishonourably discharged

now! today—————————— legacy apparent
our youth growing without
the Corporals watchful eye-
time outs, detention
stars to earn…
all to worry bout! ! !
much we have learnt
evidence mounting…

remember or imagine
for those who never felt,
the Corporals hovering hand on watch;
lol…one weighed up quick smart
if sacrifice was worth, old Corps loving touch-
and we did, at that young age
decide to take ‘one’ for a noble course
consequence learned, schooled was i

steered by our negligence/wisdom!
our impressionable youth out of balance-
drowning em in compassion
we’ve got it ass bout
before grow-ed, before ‘it’ earned

see our youth-lost
initiated wanting
self inflicted search, a cry for help
mans hammerer of fate hovering?
too late, when crashes

short life lost knowing no consequences
short life lost…when schooled on streets
long life…serving, consequence learned

the Pendulum out of control
risking destruction

come!!!
let us stand up! let us unite-
rein list the Corporal…
reinvent the old bastard… our future begs!
learn we must,
modern twist for age old teach

Utopia do we live?
Jails still exist, war still wages
are we so arrogrant…

stop preaching, they have to make their own mistakes
we must show wisdom to aid in this!
give them the tools for this journey..

RPL our children/invest in the future

when coming of age, when the chemicals hit, natural or manmade
Old Corp’s training just might save that youth from the daily horrors/ challenges of our society

civilised or uncivilised
please define!

at a loss i am…

No because…

One in five teachers? That is the also the figure then of how many teachers need more training! The only reason why a minority of teachers want to see a reintroduction of corporal punishment is because they do not have any effective discipline methods under their belts. The answer? More training, not resorting to corporal punishment. Also remember that school is for learning and it is the teachers job if the students are doing poorly. Corporate Punishment is just and excuse for teachers to whip and hurt people

there has been an increase in crime

Yes because…

It is inevitable that bad classroom behaviour will filter into life outside school. You only have to look at the crime statistics to see that crime has increased dramatically since the abolition of corporal punishment. Between 1981, when corporal punishment was legal and in 1997, after the abolition of corporal punishment, there was a 67% increase in crime (1).

(1)http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/digest4/chapter1.pdf

Additionally, the U.K.’s banning of corporal punishment is not attached to a propaganda website called nospanking.com and portrays a more convincing argument for reintroducing corporal punishment since it clearly documents crime statistics before and after the abolition of corporal punishment in schools. On the other hand, the opposing argument contradicts itself. How can you refute that the abolition of corporal punishment has not led to an increase in crime because of varying factors when the case that you cite to support your argument is so biased and overlooks a large number of factors- such as poverty, drop outs, consistent use of paddling, perceived fairness of paddling, credible or qualified teachers, etc. How can you realistically argue against a corporal punishment that has successfully been used for thousands of years in home and without to discipline children? It’s worked for all this time and managed to create fairly decent, responsible human beings without traumatizing them.

Pro-Spanking Research:

A study published in the Akron Law Review in 2009 examined criminal records and found that children raised where a legal ban on parental corporal punishment is in effect are much more likely to be involved in crime.

For example, in Sweden “enlightened” parenting seems to have produced increased violence later. “Swedish teen violence skyrocketed in the early 1990s, when children that had grown up entirely under the spanking ban first became teenagers,” Fuller noted. “Preadolescents and teenagers under fifteen started becoming even more violent toward their peers. By 1994, the number of youth criminal assaults had increased by six times the 1984 rate.”

Margaret Gunnoe in 1997 published work showing that customary spanking reduced aggression, but it went largely unnoticed by the media because it contradicted mainstream opinion. Of course, we all know that aggression is often the main culprit in violent crime.

Dr. Diana Baumrind of the University of California, Berkeley also found that children who were never spanked tended to have behavioral problems, and were not more competent than their peers. This supports the view that banning spanking would lead to an increase in crime.

No because…

You cannot single handedly blame the banning of corporal punishment for the rapid rise in crime. There are many factors, and there is nothing that definitively shows that there is a link between the banning of corporal punishment and the rise in crime. There are many things that have changed and the rise in crime is a combination of some or maybe even all of these factors, things like increase in population, increasing living expectations, the poor and the rich living in a close proximity. We should not bring back corporal punishment on a whim that it may possibly decrease the levels of crime.

Also, this theory was tested in America, where it’s flipped around and the states in the US that had corporal punishment were the states with the highest murder rates.

Those eight paddling states are. in order by murder rate: Louisiana, which has the highest murder rate in the nation (6th in the nation by percentage of students struck by educators); Mississippi, which has the 2nd highest murder rate in the nation (1st by percentage of students struck by educators); Georgia. which has the 4th highest murder rate (7th in the nation by percentage of students struck by educators); Alabama and New Mexico, tied with the 5th highest murder rate in the nation (3rd and 10th, respectively, by percentage of students struck by educators); Tennessee, which has the 7th highest murder rate (4th by percentage of students struck by educators); and North Carolina and Arizona, which are tied with the 9th highest murder rate in the nation (12th and 18th, respectively, by percentage of students struck by educators). The two non-paddling states are: Maryland, which has the 4th highest murder rate; and Illinois, which is tied with Tennessee with the 7th highest murder rate.
