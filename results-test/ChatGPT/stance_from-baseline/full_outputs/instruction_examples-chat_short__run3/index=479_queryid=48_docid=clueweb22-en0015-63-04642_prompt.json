Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Should the voting age be lowered?
Text: Argumentative Essay: Should the Voting Age Be Lowered to Thirteen?

This essay argues out whether the voting age should be lowered to thirteen. The age thirteen was picked because it is a time when a child should start thinking more about becoming an adult, and it is a time in a person’s life when the Jewish faith says a child becomes an adult.ArgumentPeople that young are too easy to manipulateOn the whole, people are easy to manipulate, especially when it comes to fear, as that is how George Bush Jr was able to run for two terms as oppose to just cheating his way in one.

People that are younger are even easier to manipulate and that will only increase the amount of fear based media and pressure when it comes to voters.Counter argumentPeople should be protected from manipulationIt is unfair to say that younger people are easier to manipulate when older people and mentally ill people are also easy to manipulate. The real answer is to make it impossible to manipulate the voters in any way, as that would means older and younger people may vote more fairly. Counter-counter argumentWe do not live in a society where such protection is possibleThere is no place in the world that has come up with a way of stopping one group or one person from manipulating another person or group of people. Whilst manipulation is possible with older people, it is still more likely to happen with younger people, which is why they should wait until they are old enough so they may vote.ArgumentRepresentation is the only way to have a voice heardThis is from the historical evidence showing that a group of people are often treat poorly until they are represented in the government in some form.

At the moment, there are no 13yr old ministers or senators, but if a younger person were able to vote then that person may vote for people with younger persons needs in mind.Counter argumentYounger people do not need representation as that is their parents’ jobIt is the job of the parents to fight for the rights and the wellbeing of their children. This is currently the case, as political candidates will often pander to the “breeders” and offer policies and attitudes that address the needs of both parents and their offspring. There is also the fact that the needs of younger people would be represented twice. The parents would still be looking out for the needs of their children, and the teens would also be looking out for their own needs. This would double the size of a certain group in unfair proportions to other groups.

ConclusionThere were some points that were missed from this essay as they are too difficult to conclude upon, such as if parents would influence the votes of their children, and people having children so that they have a bigger team of voters, etc. The arguments issued within this essay seem to point to the fact that voting ages should not be lowered.
