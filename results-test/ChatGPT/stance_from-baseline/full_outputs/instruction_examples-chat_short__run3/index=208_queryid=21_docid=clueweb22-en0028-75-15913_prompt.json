pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

No, global temperature varies independently from human emissions of CO2, and the myriad attempts to ask lame questions mincing around the edges of scientifically proven fact is a telling response to the lack of evidence supporting the claim that man’s emissions of a trace gas, control global climate, and produce catastrophic warming.

Man’s contribution to CO2 is 0.5% at the most, CO2 is only 3% of possible greenhouse warming effect, human contribution to greenhouse warming is 0.1%.
Man produces 30 -40 gigatons of CO2 annually, nature cycles 700 gigatons annually. 30/700= 0.4% of global CO2 is

Man produces 30 -40 gigatons of CO2 annually, nature cycles 700 gigatons annually. 30/700= 0.4% of global CO2 is an unlikely driver of all modern climate and temperature, given the total warming effect is 0.1% , 0.001 of the total available.

It’s magical thinking to believe carbon tax legislation, robbing the middle class, the working man, to enrich the political class and it’s green cloaked cronies has any potential to control global temperature.

It’s misanthropic and delusional to place blame, and extract money from a hoax without evidence, that blames man for the negative consequences of what appears to be normal weather.

Q: Is global climate change a direct result of human greed?

Yes, that is one of the manipulative tools used to try and convince people.

Because most people are not saints, people recognize greed as a possible motivation, and so when told it IS a motivation, they are more likely to believe such, because greed is familiar to them.

Here is Jimmy Carter asking everyone to please use less fossil fuels because the dependence of the US on OPEC oil at the time was causing financial problems.

And here he is a couple of years later. His plan to have people use less oil had

Yes, that is one of the manipulative tools used to try and convince people.

Here is Jimmy Carter asking everyone to please use less fossil fuels because the dependence of the US on OPEC oil at the time was causing financial problems.

And here he is a couple of years later. His plan to have people use less oil had failed miserably, and so he attacked the personalities of the American people. Because they did not agree with him.

Since the American people couldn’t be convinced to consume less because of economics and OPEC, it was decided to convince them to consume less another way.

Attack their morals.

Tell them the “virtuous” will consume less.

And then climate change was invented to try and convince them to consume less for their own good, and for the good of their children.

The desired goals and actions have not changed from those stated in Carter’s US Energy Independence Plan.

National Energy Program Fact Sheet on the President's Program.

Only the methods used to try convince people to change their behaviour have changed.

Early on, no. More recently, yes, to some extent.

Humanity began to use fossil fuels such as coal and peat a very long time ago, in pre-historic times. Peat bogs and exposed seams of coal were put to use. I'm sure some people were greedy, even back then, but the scope for their greediness was small. Survival, warmth, and some security were what it was all about. They had no intention to change the climate, nor were they capable of doing so. They didn't even have any science to ignore.

Now, however, everything is different. We pursue fossil fuels to previously unimaginable depths in the Earth

Humanity began to use fossil fuels such as coal and peat a very long time ago, in pre-historic times. Peat bogs and exposed seams of coal were put to use. I'm sure some people were greedy, even back then, but the scope for their greediness was small. Survival, warmth, and some security were what it was all about. They had no intention to change the climate, nor were they capable of doing so. They didn't even have any science to ignore.

Now, however, everything is different. We pursue fossil fuels to previously unimaginable depths in the Earth and consume them voraciously. They drive our economies to a significant extent. We produce and consume an astonishing variety of goods & services. Some part of that is driven by greed. We have an enormous population, so the effects of our energy habits are enormously magnified. But until fairly recently, in geologic time, we didn't know we were changing the climate. It was never our intention to do so.

But we have now developed science to a very high level, and that science tells us that our collective greenhouse gas emissions have changed and are continuing to change the planet's climate. And that if we don't change our ways, we will suffer drastic consequences. This is an established fact, with a confidence level of 95%. I.e., now we know. So now we are accountable.

If we are smart enough to act in our own best interests, we will reduce our energy consumption and turn increasingly to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change. Those sources exist and are increasingly affordable and available.
There are still lots of people who are in denial, believing that climate change is a hoax and not happening, or is happening but is beneficial. The proximate reason for their denial is that they are convinced by the fossil fuel industry and the opinion leaders the industry has bought. The intransigence of the deniers has prevented decisive action to limit climate change.

Therefore, I suggest that it is not the greed of mankind that is causing climate change, but the greed of the fossil fuel industry and the politicians, etc., they have bought, and the credulity and scientific illiteracy of the rest of the deniers.

No. It is the result of nature’s continuing cycles.

Historically, the CO2 levels have as high as 7,000 ppm, and 4,000 ppm. Temperatures were the same, so it is not true that CO2 causes temperatures to increase.

Human greed? Many want you to believe it is fact, but our contribution is so small, we don’t have any appreciable impact on the the climate. Yes, we belch CO2 from our smokestacks. Measure it, along with the other ways we emit, and you find the amount left in the air is .0008 of the total volume.

Consider your home and the environment in which it is situated. The very fact that you live in one place, something that was quite uncommon before the discovery of stored energy sources like fossil fuels, speaks to how your life is facilitated by these unique energy sources.

This might sound unconventional, but hands down I’d go with blue-chip art. A Basquait painting soared 2,209,900% when it was bought for $5,000 and sold for $110,500,000. And if you think that is crazy, a Leonardo Da Vinci painting skyrocketed 5,328,894%. Although not guaranteed, if you can f

Yes. That and the demon of conspicuous consumption, which means being seen to have wealth through the things we buy. Brand names on clothes, nice homes, the latest phone or gadget or a flash car are all signs people use to say 'look at me - I'm doing well - sleep with me'. For some it just means Nike shoes, of others it means being able to buy a nice stake or have a wine cellar with 'well chosen' wines.

We all do it and it all adds to climate change. What we buy directly has a knock on effect on the planet. Everything has an environmental price and the more we buy, the more we use, the higher t
