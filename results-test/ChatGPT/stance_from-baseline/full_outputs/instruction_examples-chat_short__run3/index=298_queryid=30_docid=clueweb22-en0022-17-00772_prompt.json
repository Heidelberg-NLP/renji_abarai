Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Laws on Purchase, Possession and Carrying of Firearms

Purchase and Possession

No state permit is required to otherwise purchase or possess a rifle, shotgun or handgun. Virginia residents may purchase firearms from any licensed Federal Firearms Licensee, even if they are out of state. A criminal history record information check is required prior to purchasing any firearm, except for an antique or its replica. A fee of $2.00 will be collected for such a check. For non-residents it is $5.00.

If any buyer or transferee is denied the right to purchase a firearm, he may exercise his right of access to and review of the criminal history record information, provided such action is initiated within thirty days of the denial. A licensed firearm dealer shall not deliver a rifle or shotgun to a non-resident until an approval report is received from the state police or 10 days have gone by, whichever comes first.

It is a crime for any person to sell, give or otherwise furnish a handgun to a minor if he has reason to believe that the buyer or recipient is under 18 years of age, unless such transfer is made between family members or for the purpose of engaging in a sporting event or activity. A person under 18 shall not possess or transport a handgun or assault firearm.1

This prohibition does not apply to a minor in his own home or on his property or on the property of another with prior permission, while accompanied by an adult while hunting, at a range or firearm educational class, and while transporting an unloaded firearm to and from such activities.

It is unlawful for a person convicted of a felony, or any person under 29 with a juvenile adjudication, as a 14-year-old or older, which would be a felony if committed by an adult, or a person acquitted by reason of insanity and committed to a mental institution, to possess or transport a firearm. It is unlawful for any person who is subject to a protective order issued pursuant to family abuse or stalking to purchase or transport any firearm while the order is in effect. It is unlawful for anyone adjudicated legally incompetent or mentally incapacitated or involuntarily committed to purchase, possess or transport a firearm. It is unlawful to transfer a firearm to such persons.

It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to authorize a child under the age of twelve to use a firearm except when the child is under the supervision of an adult.

It is unlawful to possess, sell, transfer, or import any semi-automatic folding stock shotgun with a spring tension drum magazine capable of holding 12 rounds.

A non-citizen or alien not admitted for permanent residence shall not possess or transport an assault firearm, and a gun dealer shall not transfer it to such person. Most shotguns are not included in the term assault firearm.

When a member of the armed services wishes to purchase a firearm, for the purposes of the establishment of residency for firearm purchase, residency of a member of the armed forces shall include both the state in which the member’s permanent duty post is located and any nearby state in which the member resides and from which he commutes to the permanent duty post.

When the photo-identification presented to a dealer by the prospective purchaser is a driver’s license or other photo-identification issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, and such identification form contains a date of issue, the dealer shall not, except for a renewed driver’s license or other photo-identification issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, sell or otherwise transfer a firearm to the prospective purchaser until 30 days after the date of issue of an original or duplicate driver’s license unless the prospective purchaser also presents a copy of his Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles driver’s record showing that the original date of issue of the driver’s license was more than 30 days prior to the attempted purchase.

Carrying

The open carrying of a handgun in Virginia is lawful. The carrying of any concealed firearm by a person about his person, hidden from common observation, is prohibited.

Exceptions to this prohibition include:

  • Carrying in one’s place of abode or the curtilage thereof.
  • Carrying a loaded handgun by persons who may lawfully possess such gun, inside an unlocked vehicle compartment or container, within reach of a driver or passenger who does not possess a concealed weapons permit.
  • Any regularly enrolled member of a target shooting organization who is at, or going to or from, an established shooting range, provided that the weapons are unloaded and securely wrapped while being transported.
  • Any regularly enrolled member of a weapons collection organization who is at, or going to or from, a bonafide weapons exhibition, provided the weapons are unloaded and securely wrapped while being transported.
  • Any person carrying such weapons between his place of abode and a place of purchase or repair, provided the weapons are unloaded and securely wrapped while being transported.
  • Any person actually engaged in lawful hunting under inclement weather conditions necessitating temporary protection of his firearm.
  • a retired law-enforcement officer who receives proof of consultation and favorable review is authorized to carry a concealed handgun in the same manner as a law-enforcement officer authorized to carry a concealed handgun.
  • any of the following retired officers with 20 years of service or more; any State Police officer retired from the Department of State Police, any officer retired from the Division of Capitol Police, any local law-enforcement officer, any auxiliary police officer or animal control officer retired from a police department or sheriff’s office within the Commonwealth, any special agent retired from the State Corporation Commission or the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, any conservation police officer retired from the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, and any Virginia Marine Police officer retired from the Law Enforcement Division of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.  All such persons must carry written proof of consultation with and favorable review of the need to carry a concealed handgun issued by the chief officer of the agency from which he/she resigned.

A person 21 years of age or older may apply in writing to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the county or city in which the applicant resides for a permit to carry a concealed handgun.  A member of the united states armed forces may apply to the city or county of which they are domiciled. The application shall be made under oath, before a notary or other person qualified to take oaths, and shall be made on a form prescribed by the Supreme Court, requiring only that information necessary to determine eligibility for the permit. No information or documentation other than that which is allowed on the application in accordance with law may be requested or required by the clerk or the court. State law now allows for delivery of the application to the court via U.S. Mail.

A clerk of court shall withhold from public disclosure, the applicant’s name and any other information, contained in a permit application, or any order issuing a concealed handgun permit, except that such information shall not be withheld from any law enforcement officer acting in the performance of his official duties.   The fee shall not exceed $50. The court shall issue the permit within 45 days of receipt of the completed application unless it appears that the applicant is disqualified. A court may authorize the clerk to issue concealed handgun permits, without judicial review, to applicants who have submitted complete applications, for whom the criminal history records check does not indicate a disqualification and, after consulting with either the sheriff or police department of the county or city, about which there are no outstanding questions or issues concerning the application.

The court clerk shall be immune from suit arising from any acts or omissions relating to the issuance of concealed handgun permits without judicial review unless the clerk was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct. This shall not be construed to limit, withdraw, or overturn any defense or immunity already existing in statutory or common law, or to affect any cause of action accruing prior to July 1, 2010.

The copy of a concealed handgun permit application becomes a de facto permit if the court does not grant or deny the permit within a 45-day period of the receipt of the application.  If the court has not issued the permit or determined that the applicant is disqualified within 45 days of the date of receipt noted on the application, the clerk shall certify on the application that the 45-day period has expired, and mail or send via electronic mail a copy of the certified application to the applicant within five business days of the expiration of the 45-day period.  Once the court grants or denies the application, the person either surrenders the de facto permit to the court or the person will be issued a concealed handgun permit.

A disqualified person includes:
