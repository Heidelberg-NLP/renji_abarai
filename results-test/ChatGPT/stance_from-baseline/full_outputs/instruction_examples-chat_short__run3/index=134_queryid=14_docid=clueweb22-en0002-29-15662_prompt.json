Given a query, your task is to predict the stance of a given text. You can give one of the following four labels:
pro: The text provides overall strong pro argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
con: The text provides overall strong con argumentation towards the topic in the query. 
neutral: The text contains both pro and con arguments, such that overall the stance can be considered as neutral. 
none: The text does not contain arguments or opinions towards the topic in the query, does not take the stance, and mostly contains factual information.

You should return one of the four labels: "pro", "con", "neutral" and "none".


Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

Query: Is sexual orientation determined at birth?
Text: Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigation Jump to search

Fraternal birth order has been correlated with male sexual orientation, with a significant volume of research finding that the more older brothers a male has from the same mother, the greater the probability he will have a homosexual orientation. Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert first identified the association in the 1990s and named it the fraternal birth order effect. Scientists have attributed the effect to a prenatal biological mechanism, since the association is only present in men with older biological brothers, and not present among men with older step-brothers and adoptive brothers. The mechanism is thought to be a maternal immune response to male fetuses, whereby antibodies neutralize male Y-proteins thought to play a role in sexual differentiation during development. This would leave some regions of the brain associated with sexual orientation in the 'female typical' arrangement – or attracted to men. Biochemical evidence for this hypothesis was identified in 2017, finding mothers with a gay son, particularly those with older brothers, had heightened levels of antibodies to the NLGN4Y Y-protein than mothers with heterosexual sons.[1][2]

The effect becomes stronger with each additional male pregnancy, with odds of the next son being gay increasing by 38–48%. This does not mean that all or most sons will be gay after several male pregnancies, but rather, the odds of having a gay son increase from approximately 2% for the first born son, to 3% for the second, 5% for the third and so on.[1][3] Two studies have estimated between 15% and 29% of gay men owe their sexual orientation to this effect, but noted that the number may be higher since prior miscarriages and terminations may have exposed their mothers to Y-linked antigens. It has generally been thought that this maternal response would not apply to first born gay sons and that they may owe their orientation to genes, prenatal hormones and other maternal immune responses which also influence brain development.[2] However, the 2017 lab study found that mothers with no sons had antibodies to male cells, which may be caused by common early miscarriages, and thus induce the effect for a first live born son.[4] A variety of evolutionary explanations for why the response persists have been offered by scientists.[5]

The few studies which have not observed a correlation between gay men and birth order have generally been criticized for methodological errors and sampling methods.[6] J. Michael Bailey has said that no plausible hypothesis other than a maternal immune response has been identified.[6] The effect is sometimes referred to as the older brother effect.

Overview[edit]

The fraternal birth order effect has been described by one of its proponents as "the most consistent biodemographic correlate of sexual orientation in men".[7] In 1958, it was reported that homosexual men tend to have a greater number of older siblings (i.e., a 'later/higher birth order') than comparable heterosexual men and in 1962, these findings were published in detail.[8] In 1996, Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert demonstrated that the later birth order of homosexual men was solely due to a number of older brothers and not older sisters.[9] They also showed that each older brother increased the odds of homosexuality in a later-born brother by 33%.[9] Later the same year, Blanchard and Bogaert demonstrated the older brother effect in the Kinsey Interview Data, a "very large and historically significant data base".[10][11] In a study published in 1998, Blanchard called this phenomenon the fraternal birth order effect.[12]

Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers.[13] According to several studies, each older brother increases a male child's naturally occurring odds of having a homosexual orientation by 28–48%.[12][14][15][16][17][note 1] However, the numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters have no effect on those odds.[13] It has been estimated that approximately one in seven homosexual males owes their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect.[20] There seems to be no effect of birth order on sexual orientation in women.[21][22]

Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence.[11] Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers, and biochemical evidence was found in a lab study in 2017.[1] It has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation.[7] Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with handedness,[23][11] as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males.[22][24][25][23] Since handedness develops prenatally,[26] this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect.[11] It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers.[27][28] As birth weight is undeniably prenatally determined, it is known that a common developmental factor that operates before birth necessarily underlies the fraternal birth order effect and male sexual orientation.[29]

Thirdly, the fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in diverse samples such as homosexual males from different ethnicities,[30] different cultures,[31] different historical eras,[9][32] and widely separated geographic regions.[13] The fraternal birth order effect has been demonstrated in places such as Brazil, Canada, Finland, Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Samoa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[13][33] The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual men from convenience[9][34] and representative, national probability samples.[35][36][37]

In 2017, biochemical evidence for the fraternal birth order effect was found.

In a 2017 study, researchers found an association between a maternal immune response to neuroligin 4 Y-linked protein (NLGN4Y) and subsequent sexual orientation in their sons. NLGN4Y is important in male brain development; the maternal immune reaction to it, in the form of anti-NLGN4Y antibodies, is thought to alter the brain structures underlying sexual orientation in the male fetus. The study found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. The result also indicates that mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons.[38]

Empirical findings[edit]

Biodemographics[edit]

The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways:[39] Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men.[13][40][11] It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., Older Brothers/All Siblings) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males.[13] Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., Older Brothers/Other Siblings) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males.[13]

After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers.[18][13] Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect.[9][15][11][13] Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters).[9] They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers.[9] Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding.[15]
