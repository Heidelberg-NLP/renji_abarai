Query: Do animals have rights?
Text: Animal testing and the subjugation of animals undermines a fundamental scientific reality; that humans and animals are kin. With humans and Chimpanzees sharing 99.4% of their genetic code, and humans and mice sharing 99% of their genetic code, it is important to recognize that humans are, on a scientific basis, the kin of animals. The testing of animals undermines this scientific understanding by subjugating animals. This is harmful to broader scientific progression in society.

Query: Should the UNO become a world government?
Text: So I was wondering about how the world would look if we were to have a one world government. The world would have just one government with complete control over all nations. There wouldn't need to be countries as we would have only one flag. We would all live together as one which increases welfare. However, on the other hand, a mismanaged world government can lead to global poverty.

Query: Should abortion be illegal?
Text: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies.

Query: Should suicide be a criminal offense?
Text: Sentencing a criminal should not just be about punishing them for the magnitude of the result of the crime. Instead it should be about reformation and reintegrating the offender so that they can continue their life in future without engaging in any crime. Sentencing someone who attempted to commit suicide does not aid in reintegrating the person. Instead, the person should be given psychological aid.

INSIDER TRADING UNDER SEBI (PROHIBITION OF INSIDER TRADING) REGULATION ACT:


‘Insider Trading’ is an unprincipled practice utilized to by those privy to certain unpublished information relating to the Company to profit at the expense of the general investors who do not have access to such information. The purpose of the current Regulations is therefore, to prevent insider trading by prohibiting dealing, communicating, counseling or procuring ‘unpublished price sensitive information’. The Company (Act) had earlier framed “The Code for Prevention of Insider Trading” as required by Regulations to be observed by the Directors and Designated Employees in the performance of their duties. This earlier code is now being amended to bring in line as required under regulation of the SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INIDA (PROHIBITION OF INSIDER TRADING) REGULATIONS, 2015, where the Code of fair disclosure for the company has also been adopted by the Board of Directors, who would ensure that the management adheres to this code to make the Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) of the Company would be available to the general public as soon as it is possible for the Company to do so.


It is well known that high standards of corporate governance and transparency are essential to the development of the capital markets. The expose of information concerning a company enables investors to take decisions regarding investments in securities of such a company. For prices of securities to accurately reflect appropriate information about a company including an essential precondition for efficient functioning of capital markets, such information should be equally available to all market participants at the same time. It is known that distortions in the market if company insiders possess superior information that they use to trade in the securities of their company, which is unavailable to the counterparties with whom they trade or the market general, and hence, the laws that prohibit insider trading are enacted. Apart from preserving the capital market efficiency, there are other justifications as well for regulating insider trading. Insider trading basically results to unfairness to investors who possess inferior information, it undermines investor confidence and integrity of the securities markets, and is also regarded as theft or misappropriation of information. Despite knowing about it, the opponents of regulating insider trading was eloquent about its virus, including the fact that it may result in greater market efficiency and operate as a form of compensating employees, thereby, motivating them to generate greater corporate performance that benefits all shareholders.


From a realistic point of view, insider trading is a noteworthy concern particularly for public listed companies in several situations. Selective information may be available to insiders within a company such as board of directors, senior officers as well as to external adviser, this could relate to negotiation of material contracts, information regarding board meetings, financial result, dividend declaration and the like as well as significant corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, rights offerings and private placement of securities. From the past many years the regulations relating to insider trading and their enforcement have been substantially strengthened. In India, the first initiative to address this concern was made in 1947 through the establishment of the Thomas Committee, which were later on codified under various provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. Soon with the evolution of the corporate sector came in the establishment of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 1988 and in 1992 came in the SEBI Act along with SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. This led to a statutory evolution against the practice of insider trading in India. Although the initial years did not witness much prosecution, however, SEBI did initiate a high profile action against Hindustan Lever and a few had acquired shares of Brooke Bond prior to the announcement of the merger, an act that amounted to insider trading and also the laws kept on becoming stricter and tighter with time in order to cover every loophole available. In 2015 came in a major development when the SEBI brought in SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 which replaced the older regulations of 1992 and addressed most of the problems of the older regulation. In 2018, SEBI formed a committee under the Chairmanship of T.K. Viswanathan to take a deeper look into the problems of the new regulations and give its recommendations. On receiving the Committee’s report, SEBI made the latest amendments to these regulations in 2019 which are now the present laws against insider trading in India.


The role played by the demand and supply contributes in regulating the prices of the shares. This is to say that when people buy the shares of a particular company, the demand for the share increases thereby the price of the shares of that company increases in the stock market and vice versa. By investigating in a company’s share, an investor, i.e. the shareholder becomes an owner of that particular company to such extent as in relation to the value of shares held by him, and is thus, entitled to a share in the profits earned by the company, and such a share in profits that is distributed to the shareholder is known as dividends. The performance of a company is of foremost significance to the investors and the general public who might invest in the company. The Indian company law provides that a company should prepare an annual account showing the company’s trading results during the relevant arrear (section 210, Companies Act, 1956). Also it makes it necessary that the company publishes its assets and liabilities at the end of the period along with t
